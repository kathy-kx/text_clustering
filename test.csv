"Lung cancer risk and cancer-specific mortality in subjects undergoing routine imaging test when stratified with and without identified lung nodule on imaging study To assess the risk of lung cancer and specific mortality rate in patients with and without solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) on chest radiograph and CT. This prospective study included 16,078 patients ≥35 years old (893 of them had an SPN detected with either chest radiograph or CT) and 15,185 without SPN. Patients were followed up for 18 months or until being diagnosed with lung cancer. Risk and mortality lung cancer were calculated in both groups with Poisson regression. In patients with SPN, incidence of lung cancer was 8.3 % (95 % CI 6.0–11.2) on radiograph and 12.4 % (95 % CI 9.3–15.9) on CT. A chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with radiographs (odds ratio 2.62; 95 % CI 1.03, 6.67) and smoking habit (odds ratio 20.63; 95 % CI 3.84, 110.77) in patients with CT were associated with a higher probability of lung cancer. Large nodule size and spiculated edge were associated with lung cancer on both CT and radiograph. Lung cancer-specific mortality was lower in patients with SPN than in those without SPN (1.73/1000 person-years, 95 % CI 1.08–2.88 vs. 2.15/1000 person-years, 95 % CI 1.25–3.96). The risk of lung cancer for patients with SPN is higher in clinical populations than in screening studies. Moreover, patients with SPN showed lower mortality than those without SPN. • Lung cancer risk is 8 % for SPN detected on routine radiographs.;  • Lung cancer risk is 12.4 % for SPN detected in routine chest CT.;  • Smoking, COPD, SPN diameter and edge were predictors of malignancy.;  • Lung cancer risk of SPN in routine practice seems higher than in screening.","lung cancer risk and cancer-specific mortality in subjects undergoing routine imaging test when stratified with and without identified lung nodule on imaging study to assess the risk of lung cancer and specific mortality rate in patients with and without solitary pulmonary nodules (spn) on chest radiograph and ct. this prospective study included 16,078 patients ≥35 years old (893 of them had an spn detected with either chest radiograph or ct) and 15,185 without spn. patients were followed up for 18 months or until being diagnosed with lung cancer. risk and mortality lung cancer were calculated in both groups with poisson regression. in patients with spn, incidence of lung cancer was 8.3 % (95 % ci 6.0–11.2) on radiograph and 12.4 % (95 % ci 9.3–15.9) on ct. a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with radiographs (odds ratio 2.62; 95 % ci 1.03, 6.67) and smoking habit (odds ratio 20.63;",lung risk specific mortality subject undergoing routine image test stratify without identify lung nodule image assess risk lung specific mortality rate without solitary pulmonary nodule spn chest radiograph ct prospective include year old spn detect either chest radiograph ct without spn follow month diagnose lung risk mortality lung calculate group poisson regression spn incidence lung ci radiograph ci ct chronic obstructive pulmonary radiographs odds ratio ci smoking habit odds ratio,c,Lung Cancer

"Hepatic proliferation after partial liver irradiation in Sprague–Dawley rats The liver has powerful capability to proliferate in response to various injuries, but little is known as to liver proliferation after irradiation (IR) injury. This study investigated whether liver proliferation could be stimulated in low-dose irradiated liver by partial liver IR injury with high dose radiation. Sprague–Dawley rats were irradiated by 6-MV X-ray with single dose of 25 Gy to the right-half liver, while the left-half liver was shielded (0.7 Gy) or irradiated with single doses of 3.2, 5.6, and 8.0 Gy, respectively. Hepatic proliferation in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half liver was evaluated by serum hepatic growth factor (HGF), proliferating cell nuclei antigen (PCNA), liver proliferation index (PI), hepatocyte mitosis index (MI). The observation time was 0 day (before IR), 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after IR. Our results showed that serum HGF and hepatocyte HGF mRNA increased after IR with HGF mRNA peak on day 30 in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half livers, and their values increased as the dose increased to the left-half liver. Liver PI and PCNA mRNA peaked on day 60 with stronger expressions in higher doses-irradiated livers. MI increased after IR, with the peak noted on day 60 in the shielded and on day 90 in the low-dose irradiated left-half livers. There was a 30 day delay between MI peaks in the shielded and low-dose irradiated livers. In conclusion, 25 Gy partial liver IR injury could stimulate the shielded liver and low-dose irradiated liver to proliferate. In the livers receiving a dose range of 3.2–8.0 Gy, the proliferation was stronger in higher doses-irradiated liver than the low-dose irradiated. However, IR delayed hepatocyte mitosis.","hepatic proliferation after partial liver irradiation in sprague–dawley rats the liver has powerful capability to proliferate in response to various injuries, but little is known as to liver proliferation after irradiation (ir) injury. this study investigated whether liver proliferation could be stimulated in low-dose irradiated liver by partial liver ir injury with high dose radiation. sprague–dawley rats were irradiated by 6-mv x-ray with single dose of 25 gy to the right-half liver, while the left-half liver was shielded (0.7 gy) or irradiated with single doses of 3.2, 5.6, and 8.0 gy, respectively. hepatic proliferation in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half liver was evaluated by serum hepatic growth factor (hgf), proliferating cell nuclei antigen (pcna), liver proliferation index (pi), hepatocyte mitosis index (mi). the observation time was 0 day (before ir), 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after ir. our results showed that serum hgf and hepatocyte hgf mrna increased",hepatic proliferation partial liver irradiation sprague dawley rat liver powerful capability proliferate response various injury little know liver proliferation irradiation ir injury investigate whether liver proliferation could stimulate low dose irradiate liver partial liver ir injury high dose radiation sprague dawley rat irradiate mv x ray single dose gy right half liver left half liver shield gy irradiate single dos gy respectively hepatic proliferation shielded low dose irradiate leave half liver evaluate serum hepatic growth factor hgf proliferate cell nuclei antigen pcna liver proliferation index pi hepatocyte mitosis index mi observation time day ir day ir result show serum hgf hepatocyte hgf mrna increase,b,Liver Cancer

"DACT2 is a functional tumor suppressor through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated with poor survival in colon cancer. Dapper homolog (DACT) 2 is one of the Dact gene family members, which are important modulators of Wnt signaling pathway. We aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in colon cancer. DACT2 was silenced in five out of eight colon cancer cell lines, but robustly expressed in normal colon tissues. The loss of DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. Restoring DACT2 expression in colon cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, DACT2 overexpression effectively reduced lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. These effects by DACT2 were attributed to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Reexpression of DACT2 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of both wild-type β-catenin and degradation-resistant form mutant β-catenin (S33Y). DACT2 could actively shuttle into and out of nuclei, with its predominant steady-state localization in the cytoplasm dependent on its nuclear export signal. Co-immunoprecipitation results indicated that DACT2 strongly associated β-catenin as well as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and directly disrupted the formation of the β-catenin–LEF1 complex in the nucleus. Whereas in the cytoplasm, DACT2 restored junctional localization of E-cadherin–β-catenin complexes and prevented β-catenin nuclear translocation through direct interaction with β-catenin. DACT2 methylation was detected in 43.3% (29/67) of colon cancer tissues, but none in normal controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with DACT2 methylation had a significant decrease in overall survival (P=0.006). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that DACT2 methylation was significantly associated with shortened survival in stage I–III colon cancer patients. In conclusion, DACT2 acts as a functional tumor suppressor in colon cancer through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Its methylation at early stages of colon carcinogenesis is an independent prognostic factor.","dact2 is a functional tumor suppressor through inhibiting wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated with poor survival in colon cancer. dapper homolog (dact) 2 is one of the dact gene family members, which are important modulators of wnt signaling pathway. we aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in colon cancer. dact2 was silenced in five out of eight colon cancer cell lines, but robustly expressed in normal colon tissues. the loss of dact2 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. restoring dact2 expression in colon cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. moreover, dact2 overexpression effectively reduced lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. these effects by dact2 were attributed to inhibition of wnt/β-catenin signaling. reexpression of dact2 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of both wild-type β-catenin and degradation-resistant form mutant β-catenin",dact functional suppressor inhibit wnt catenin pathway associate poor survival colon dapper homolog dact one dact gene family member important modulators wnt signal pathway clarify epigenetic inactivation biological function implication colon dact silence five eight colon cell line robustly express normal colon tissue loss dact expression regulate promoter hypermethylation restore dact expression colon cell line suppress cell growth induce cell apoptosis inhibit cell proliferation vitro vivo moreover dact overexpression effectively reduce lung metastasis colon cell nude mouse effect dact attribute inhibition wnt catenin signal reexpression dact significantly suppress transcriptional activity wild type catenin degradation resistant form mutant catenin,a,Colon Cancer
"Forecasting lung cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence to year 2030. Background Lung cancer incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide and there is a focus on prevention, early detection, and development of new treatments which will impact the epidemiological patterns of lung cancer. The clinical characteristics and the trends in incidence, mortality, and prevalence of lung cancer in Denmark from 2006 through 2015 are described and a model for predicting the future epidemiological profile of lung cancer through 2030 is introduced. Methods The study population comprised all cases of lung cancer, registered in the Danish Cancer Registry, who were alive on January 1, 2006 or had a first-time ever diagnosis of lung cancer during 2006 through 2015. Information on morphology, stage of the disease, comorbidity and survival was obtained from other Danish health registers. Based on NORDCAN data and estimated patient mortality rates as well as prevalence proportions for the period 2006 through 2015, future case numbers of annual incidence, deaths, and resulting prevalence were projected. Results A total of 44.291 patients were included in the study. A shift towards more patients diagnosed with lower stages and with adenocarcinoma was observed. The incidence increased and the patient mortality rate decreased significantly, with a doubling of the prevalence during the observation period. We project that the numbers of prevalent cases of lung cancer in Denmark most likely will increase from about 10,000 at the end of 2015 to about 23,000 at the end of 2030. Conclusions Our findings support that lung cancer is being diagnosed at an earlier stage, that incidence will stop increasing, that mortality will decrease further, and that the prevalence will continue to increase substantially. Projections of cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence are important for planning health services and should be updated at regular intervals.","forecasting lung cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence to year 2030. background lung cancer incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide and there is a focus on prevention, early detection, and development of new treatments which will impact the epidemiological patterns of lung cancer. the clinical characteristics and the trends in incidence, mortality, and prevalence of lung cancer in denmark from 2006 through 2015 are described and a model for predicting the future epidemiological profile of lung cancer through 2030 is introduced. methods the study population comprised all cases of lung cancer, registered in the danish cancer registry, who were alive on january 1, 2006 or had a first-time ever diagnosis of lung cancer during 2006 through 2015. information on morphology, stage of the disease, comorbidity and survival was obtained from other danish health registers. based on nordcan data and estimated patient mortality rates as well as prevalence proportions for the period",forecast lung incidence mortality prevalence year lung incidence prevalence increase worldwide focus prevention early detection development new impact epidemiological pattern lung characteristic trend incidence mortality prevalence lung denmark describe model predict future epidemiological profile lung introduce method population comprise lung register danish registry alive january first time ever diagnosis lung information morphology stage comorbidity survival obtain danish health register base nordcan data estimate mortality rate well prevalence proportion period,c,Lung Cancer

"Arachidonic acid suppresses lung cancer cell growth and modulates lipid metabolism and the ERK/PPARγ signaling pathway. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of new treatment strategies. Arachidonic acid (ARA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows promise in cancer therapy due to its potential anti-tumor effects, although its role in lung cancer remains unclear. This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of ARA on A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells. In vitro assays were used to assess cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, lipid droplet formation, and changes in cellular lipid content. ARA dose-dependently suppressed cell viability, facilitated apoptosis, and suppressed colony formation in both lung cancer cell lines. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify potential gene targets and pathways, uncovering 61 overlapping genes between ARA and lung cancer-related targets, with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) emerging as a key gene. Enrichment analyses suggested that the effects of ARA might be mediated through lipid metabolism and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling pathway. In both lung cancer cell lines, ARA treatment inhibited lipid droplet formation and decreased the cellular lipids. Immunoblotting further confirmed that ARA treatment significantly increased ERK phosphorylation while reducing PPARγ and fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. In vitro experiments using GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, confirmed that inhibiting lipid droplet formation impairs lung cancer cell viability and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that ARA significantly reduced tumor size and weight in a lung cancer xenograft model, further validating its anti-tumor effects. The potential of ARA as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer might involve lipid metabolism and relevant signaling pathways. A future study exploring the full therapeutic potential of ARA and underlying mechanisms in lung cancer is needed.","arachidonic acid suppresses lung cancer cell growth and modulates lipid metabolism and the erk/pparγ signaling pathway. lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of new treatment strategies. arachidonic acid (ara), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows promise in cancer therapy due to its potential anti-tumor effects, although its role in lung cancer remains unclear. this study investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of ara on a549 and nci-h1299 lung cancer cells. in vitro assays were used to assess cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, lipid droplet formation, and changes in cellular lipid content. ara dose-dependently suppressed cell viability, facilitated apoptosis, and suppressed colony formation in both lung cancer cell lines. network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify potential gene targets and pathways, uncovering 61 overlapping genes between ara and lung cancer-related targets, with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (mapk1) emerging as a key gene. enrichment analyses suggested",arachidonic acid suppresses lung cell growth modulate lipid metabolism erk ppar signal pathway lung remain lead cause relate mortality worldwide necessitate development new strategy arachidonic acid ara polyunsaturated fatty acid show promise therapy due potential anti effect although role lung remain unclear investigate effect underlie mechanism ara nci h lung cell vitro assay use assess cell viability apoptosis colony formation lipid droplet formation change cellular lipid content ara dose dependently suppress cell viability facilitate apoptosis suppress colony formation lung cell line network pharmacology perform identify potential gene target pathway uncover overlap gene ara lung relate target mitogen activate protein kinase mapk emerge key gene enrichment suggest,c,Lung Cancer
"The platelet to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio is associated with thyroid hormone abnormalities based on NHANES 2007 to 2012 data. Thyroid hormone abnormalities are closely associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, yet easily accessible predictors remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between the platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) and thyroid hormone levels, including thyroid dysfunction. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. Weighted multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between PHR and thyroid hormone levels, as well as the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction. Subgroup analyses, smoothing curve fitting, and threshold effect analyses were also conducted to further explore potential associations. A total of 8440 participants were included, with a mean age of 47.83 ± 18.48 years and a mean platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) of 20.64 ± 8.43. Significant differences in thyroid hormone levels were observed across PHR quartiles, with higher PHR quartiles associated with elevated FT3, TT4, and hypothyroidism prevalence, and lower FT4/FT3 and FT4/TT4 ratios.In unadjusted models, PHR was positively correlated with FT3 (β = 0.007, P < 0.001), TT4 (β = 0.017, P < 0.001), and hypothyroidism (OR = 1.024, P = 0.012), and negatively correlated with FT4/FT3 and FT4/TT4 ratios. After adjusting for potential confounders, these associations remained significant. The odds of hypothyroidism were higher in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1.Nonlinear associations were observed in the threshold effect analysis, with inflection points for FT3 and TT4 at 10.050 and 24.706, respectively. Below these points, PHR showed a negative association with FT3 and a positive association with TT4, while the associations plateaued above the inflection points. PHR, a readily available biomarker, is significantly associated with FT3, TT4, and the prevalence of hypothyroidism.

"Which is more important in the management of splenic flexure colon cancer: strict central lymph node dissection or adequate bowel resection margin? What qualifies as optimal lymph node (LN) dissection in the surgical management of splenic flexure colon cancer (SFCC) still remains controversial because few studies have evaluated the distribution of LN metastasis of SFCC. The aim of this study was to clarify detailed distribution of LN metastasis and long-term outcomes of SFCC. This retrospective study enrolled patients who had curative colectomy for primary transverse or descending colon cancer of pathological stage I, II, or III at a single high-volume cancer center between April 2002 and December 2018. The 538 eligible patients were divided into three groups: patients with SFCC (SFCC group, n = 168), patients with proximal transverse colon cancer (PTCC group, n = 290), and patients with distal descending colon cancer (DDCC group, n = 80). LNs were classified into horizontal (pericolic) and vertical (intermediate and main) nodes. Intermediate and main LN station numbers were defined according to the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum classification. Distributions of LN metastasis and long-term outcomes were compared. In the SFCC group, the mean age was 67.3 ± 10.5 years and 110 patients (65.5%) were male. The proportion of patients with LN metastasis in the intermediate or main region was significantly lower in the SFCC group (8%) than in the PTCC (37%) (p < 0.01) or DDCC group (29%) (p < 0.01) in pathological stage III patients. In the SFCC group, the incidence of pericolic LN metastasis on the oral side of tumor (43%) was significantly higher than in the PTCC group (21%) (p < 0.01) and was similar to that in the DDCC group (42%) (p = 0.51), while in the SFCC group, the incidence of pericolic LN metastasis on the anal side of tumor (17%) was lower than in the PTCC group (31%) and was also similar to that in the DDCC group (21%). There were no significant differences in disease-specific survival rates among all groups. LN metastasis occurred mainly in the pericolic region, especially on the oral side of the tumor in SFCC. It may, therefore, be important to have an adequate bowel resection margin, especially on the oral side, for SFCC.","which is more important in the management of splenic flexure colon cancer: strict central lymph node dissection or adequate bowel resection margin? what qualifies as optimal lymph node (ln) dissection in the surgical management of splenic flexure colon cancer (sfcc) still remains controversial because few studies have evaluated the distribution of ln metastasis of sfcc. the aim of this study was to clarify detailed distribution of ln metastasis and long-term outcomes of sfcc. this retrospective study enrolled patients who had curative colectomy for primary transverse or descending colon cancer of pathological stage i, ii, or iii at a single high-volume cancer center between april 2002 and december 2018. the 538 eligible patients were divided into three groups: patients with sfcc (sfcc group, n = 168), patients with proximal transverse colon cancer (ptcc group, n = 290), and patients with distal descending colon cancer (ddcc group, n = 80). lns were",important management splenic flexure colon strict central lymph node dissection adequate bowel resection margin qualify optimal lymph node ln dissection surgical management splenic flexure colon sfcc still remain controversial evaluate distribution ln metastasis sfcc clarify detailed distribution ln metastasis long term outcome sfcc retrospective enrol curative colectomy primary transverse descend colon pathological stage ii iii single high volume center april december eligible divide three group sfcc sfcc group n proximal transverse colon ptcc group n distal descend colon ddcc group n lns,a,Colon Cancer

"Spontaneous regression of advanced transverse colon cancer with remaining lymph node metastasis. The observation of spontaneous regression (SR) has been well documented for many cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and malignant melanoma. However, the SR frequency in colorectal cancer is very rare. Therefore, the accumulation of SR colorectal cancer cases might contribute to find the regression mechanism. A 67-year-old woman received colonoscopy due to being positive for fecal occult blood testing and was diagnosed as having a transverse colon cancer at a local hospital. She was admitted to our institution for surgical treatment of the colon cancer. The colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor of 13 mm in diameter at the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. The enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an enlarged lymph node in the intermediate lymph node region. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT showed no abnormal accumulation on the transverse colon; however, an abnormal accumulation was found at the enlarged lymph node. The patient was preoperatively diagnosed as having advanced transverse colon cancer with lymph node metastasis and underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed only a scar-like tissue and no cancerous lesion in the transverse colon, while a metastatic lymph node was histologically confirmed in the intermediate lymph node region. Loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression was observed in the cancer cells of both biopsy specimens and resected lymph nodes. No recurrence was seen for 5 years after surgery. We reported a rare case of SR of the primary transverse colon cancer without regression of the metastatic regional lymph node. We considered that colorectal cancer with SR should be resected because even if SR of the primary lesion occurs, lymph node metastasis might have an inconsistent behavior as shown in the present case.","spontaneous regression of advanced transverse colon cancer with remaining lymph node metastasis. the observation of spontaneous regression (sr) has been well documented for many cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and malignant melanoma. however, the sr frequency in colorectal cancer is very rare. therefore, the accumulation of sr colorectal cancer cases might contribute to find the regression mechanism. a 67-year-old woman received colonoscopy due to being positive for fecal occult blood testing and was diagnosed as having a transverse colon cancer at a local hospital. she was admitted to our institution for surgical treatment of the colon cancer. the colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor of 13 mm in diameter at the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. the enhanced computed tomography (ct) showed an enlarged lymph node in the intermediate lymph node region. the 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/ct showed no abnormal accumulation on the transverse",spontaneous regression advanced transverse colon remain lymph node metastasis observation spontaneous regression sr well document many type include renal cell carcinoma non hodgkin lymphoma leukemia neuroblastoma malignant melanoma however sr frequency colorectal rare therefore accumulation sr colorectal might contribute find regression mechanism year old woman receive colonoscopy due positive fecal occult blood testing diagnose transverse colon local hospital admit institution surgical colon colonoscopy reveal type mm diameter hepatic flexure transverse colon enhance compute tomography ct show enlarged lymph node intermediate lymph node region f fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ct show abnormal accumulation transverse,a,Colon Cancer

"Laparoscopic ileo-transverse bypass may contribute to achieving curative resection for locally advanced right colon cancer: a case report. The strategy for treating obstructive colon cancers with metastatic lesions remains unclear. Herein, we report a case of laparoscopic ileo-transverse colon bypass (LITB) before preoperative chemotherapy for an obstructive right colon cancer. A 59-year-old woman was referred to our institution (Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Chiba Cancer Center) for liver tumors detected on ultrasound. The clinical diagnosis was ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases. Based on the criteria of the International Union against Cancer Committee, 8th edition, the staging was confirmed as cT4aN1M1a(H), cStage IV. Although the primary tumor in the ascending colon extended beyond the colonic wall, curative resection was possible for both primary and metastatic tumors. We planned to administer chemotherapy before the radical surgery to obtain tumor-free resection margins; however, as the obstruction was fatal, LITB was prioritized and performed using five ports. An intracorporeal side-to-side anastomosis was performed between the ileum, 25 cm from the terminal ileum, and the transverse colon. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 18 without any complications. After LITB, for preoperative chemotherapy, five courses of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CapeOX) + bevacizumab were administered. Six weeks after the preoperative chemotherapy, right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection and right hepatectomy were performed. Pathological findings of the resected specimen confirmed curative resection of both lesions, and a favorable effect of chemotherapy was obtained. The patient has been alive for over 8 months after the surgery, with no evidence of cancer recurrence. This case report demonstrates the effectiveness of LITB for obstructive right colon cancer in patients who need preoperative chemotherapy.","laparoscopic ileo-transverse bypass may contribute to achieving curative resection for locally advanced right colon cancer: a case report. the strategy for treating obstructive colon cancers with metastatic lesions remains unclear. herein, we report a case of laparoscopic ileo-transverse colon bypass (litb) before preoperative chemotherapy for an obstructive right colon cancer. a 59-year-old woman was referred to our institution (department of gastroenterological surgery, chiba cancer center) for liver tumors detected on ultrasound. the clinical diagnosis was ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases. based on the criteria of the international union against cancer committee, 8th edition, the staging was confirmed as ct4an1m1a(h), cstage iv. although the primary tumor in the ascending colon extended beyond the colonic wall, curative resection was possible for both primary and metastatic tumors. we planned to administer chemotherapy before the radical surgery to obtain tumor-free resection margins; however, as the obstruction was fatal, litb was prioritized and",laparoscopic ileo transverse bypass may contribute achieve curative resection locally advanced right colon report strategy treat obstructive colon metastatic lesion remain unclear herein report laparoscopic ileo transverse colon bypass litb preoperative chemotherapy obstructive right colon year old woman refer institution department gastroenterological surgery chiba center liver detect ultrasound diagnosis ascend colon multiple liver metastasis base criterion international union committee th edition staging confirm ct h cstage iv although primary ascending colon extend beyond colonic wall curative resection possible primary metastatic plan administer chemotherapy radical surgery obtain free resection margin however obstruction fatal litb prioritize,a,Colon Cancer
"Mutations and polymorphisms of genes moderate increase in gastric cancer risk Results of studies performed in our center point at DNA changes of many cancer (mostly moderate) susceptibility genes.

I157T was over-represented in the group of familial gastric cancer patients, particularly in patients diagnosed at less than 50 years of age (OR=3.687, p=0.0011) and females. The specific group of intestinal and mixed histopathological subtype occurs more frequently (OR=1.671) in consecutive carriers of I157T mutation.; ; Recently, the NOD2/CARD15, gene located on chromosome 16q12, has been associated with Crohn’s disease. It is believed to play a role both in intracellular recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typical of Gram negative bacteria and subsequent activation of NFkB. 3020insC NOD2 mutation causes an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and colorectal cancer in their course. In light of recent studies, in fact 3020insC mutation predisposes to cancers of many organs, including breast, ovarian, lung. Studies conducted in our center in the group of 103 patients with a family history of gastric cancer, have shown that NOD2 3020insC carriers in persons over 50 y of age more than doubled (OR=2.479, p=0.022) and among women almost 3-fold increased risk. In addition, NOD2 R702W alteration occurred almost three times more frequently (OR=2.816, p=0.0121) in the group of 241 consecutive patients with gastric cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age and over 2-times frequently (OR=2.268, p=0.0371) in gastric cancer selected histopathologically as intestinal type according to Lauren.; ; There are a large number of reports describing the relationship between changes in the gene TP53, particularly polimomorfizm Arg72Pro, and risk of gastric cancer.

"Circular RNA circMET drives immunosuppression and anti-PD1 therapy resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR-30-5p/snail/DPP4 axis Amplification of chromosome 7q21-7q31 is associated with tumor recurrence and multidrug resistance, and several genes in this region are powerful drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the key circular RNAs (circRNAs) in this region that regulate the initiation and development of HCC. We used qRT-PCR to assess the expression of 43 putative circRNAs in this chromosomal region in human HCC and matched nontumor tissues. In addition, we used cultured HCC cells to modify circRNA expression and assessed the effects in several cell-based assays as well as gene expression analyses via RNA-seq. Modified cells were implanted into immunocompetent mice to assess the effects on tumor development. We performed additional experiments to determine the mechanism of action of these effects. circMET (hsa_circ_0082002) was overexpressed in HCC tumors, and circMET expression was associated with survival and recurrence in HCC patients. By modifying the expression of circMET in HCC cells in vitro, we found that circMET overexpression promoted HCC development by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and enhancing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, circMET induced this microenvironment through the miR-30-5p/Snail/ dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4)/CXCL10 axis. In addition, the combination of the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin and anti-PD1 antibody improved antitumor immunity in immunocompetent mice. Clinically, HCC tissues from diabetic patients receiving sitagliptin showed higher CD8+ T cell infiltration than those from HCC patients with diabetes without sitagliptin treatment. circMET is an onco-circRNA that induces HCC development and immune tolerance via the Snail/DPP4/CXCL10 axis. Furthermore, sitagliptin may enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in a subgroup of patients with HCC.","circular rna circmet drives immunosuppression and anti-pd1 therapy resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the mir-30-5p/snail/dpp4 axis amplification of chromosome 7q21-7q31 is associated with tumor recurrence and multidrug resistance, and several genes in this region are powerful drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). we aimed to investigate the key circular rnas (circrnas) in this region that regulate the initiation and development of hcc. we used qrt-pcr to assess the expression of 43 putative circrnas in this chromosomal region in human hcc and matched nontumor tissues. in addition, we used cultured hcc cells to modify circrna expression and assessed the effects in several cell-based assays as well as gene expression analyses via rna-seq. modified cells were implanted into immunocompetent mice to assess the effects on tumor development. we performed additional experiments to determine the mechanism of action of these effects. circmet (hsa_circ_0082002) was overexpressed in hcc tumors, and circmet expression was associated with",circular rna circmet drive immunosuppression anti pd therapy resistance hepatocellular carcinoma via mir p snail dpp axis amplification chromosome q q associate recurrence multidrug resistance several gene region powerful driver hepatocellular carcinoma hcc investigate key circular rna circrnas region regulate initiation development hcc use qrt pcr assess expression putative circrnas chromosomal region human hcc match nontumor tissue addition use culture hcc cell modify circrna expression assess effect several cell base assay well gene expression analyse via rna seq modify cell implant immunocompetent mouse assess effect development perform additional experiment determine mechanism action effect circmet hsa circ overexpressed hcc circmet expression associate,b,Liver Cancer
"Orthotopic mouse models for the preclinical and translational study of targeted therapies against metastatic human thyroid carcinoma with BRAF V600E or wild-type BRAF Molecular signature of advanced and metastatic thyroid carcinoma involves deregulation of multiple fundamental pathways activated in the tumor microenvironment. They include BRAFV600E and AKT that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. They can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. Humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. In addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic effects of treatments. So far, human thyroid cancer in vivo models were mainly used to test single compounds, non selective and selective. Despite the greater antitumor activity and lower toxicity obtained with different selective drugs in respect to non-selective ones, most of them are only able to delay disease progression, which ultimately could restart with similar aggressive behavior. Aggressive thyroid tumors (for example, anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) carry several complex genetic alterations that are likely cooperating to promote disease progression and might confer resistance to single-compound approaches. Orthotopic models of human thyroid cancer also hold the potential to be good models for testing novel combinatorial therapies. In this article, we will summarize results on preclinical testing of selective and nonselective single compounds in orthotopic mouse models based on validated human thyroid cancer cell lines harboring the BRAFV600E mutation or with wild-type BRAF. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential use of this model also for combinatorial approaches, which are expected to take place in the upcoming human thyroid cancer basic and clinical research.","orthotopic mouse models for the preclinical and translational study of targeted therapies against metastatic human thyroid carcinoma with braf v600e or wild-type braf molecular signature of advanced and metastatic thyroid carcinoma involves deregulation of multiple fundamental pathways activated in the tumor microenvironment. they include brafv600e and akt that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. they can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. in addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic",orthotopic mouse model preclinical translational targeted therapy metastatic human thyroid carcinoma braf v e wild type braf molecular signature advanced metastatic thyroid carcinoma involve deregulation multiple fundamental pathway activate microenvironment include brafv e akt affect initiation progression metastasis human thyroid orthotopic mouse model base human cell line generally harbor genetic alteration find human thyroid reproduce vivo situ thyroid many feature aggressive refractory human advance thyroid carcinoma include local invasion metastasis humanize orthotopic mouse model seem ideal commonly use preclinical translational compound therapy may mimic key aspect human e g metastasis also reproducibility addition might provide possibility evaluate systemic,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Differential motility stimulation but not growth stimulation or adhesion of metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells by target organ-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Liver is the most common distant metastatic site for colorectal cancers and when blood-borne colorectal cancer cells reach the liver, they first encounter hepatic capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells. Thus we studied differences between highly (HT-29LMM) and poorly (HT-29P) liver-metastatic sublines of human colorectal cancer cells by examining the interactions between tumor cells and liver microvessel endothelial cells. Using hepatic sinusoidal endothelial (HSE) and lung microvessel endothelial (MLE) cell-conditioned medium we measured the growth and motility stimulating activities released from these endothelial cells and adhesion of these cancer cells to the endothelial cells. Differences in the ability of HSE-conditioned medium (HSE-CM) or MLE-conditioned medium (MLE-CM) to stimulate HT-29 cell growth were not observed. There was a small but significant increase in the rate of adhesion of highly metastatic HT-29LMM cells to HSE cell monolayers than poorly metastatic HT-29P cells, but there was no difference in adhesion to MLE cell monolayers. HSE-CM stimulated the motility of highly metastatic colorectal cancer cells to a greater extent than the poorly metastatic cells. Motility-stimulating activity for the colorectal cancer cell lines was not detected in MLE-CM. The HSE-CM motility-stimulating activity for human HT-29 cells was not removed using antibodies against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF), complement component C3 or laminin, indicating that it is not related to these known liver-derived motility factors. The results suggest that the ability of highly metastatic HT-29LMM colorectal cancer cells to colonize the liver is related to their ability to respond to liver sinusoidal endothelial cell-derived motility factors and to a lesser degree to adhere to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.","differential motility stimulation but not growth stimulation or adhesion of metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells by target organ-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. liver is the most common distant metastatic site for colorectal cancers and when blood-borne colorectal cancer cells reach the liver, they first encounter hepatic capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells. thus we studied differences between highly (ht-29lmm) and poorly (ht-29p) liver-metastatic sublines of human colorectal cancer cells by examining the interactions between tumor cells and liver microvessel endothelial cells. using hepatic sinusoidal endothelial (hse) and lung microvessel endothelial (mle) cell-conditioned medium we measured the growth and motility stimulating activities released from these endothelial cells and adhesion of these cancer cells to the endothelial cells. differences in the ability of hse-conditioned medium (hse-cm) or mle-conditioned medium (mle-cm) to stimulate ht-29 cell growth were not observed. there was a small but significant increase in the rate of adhesion of highly metastatic",differential motility stimulation growth stimulation adhesion metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cell target organ derive liver sinusoidal endothelial cell liver common distant metastatic site colorectal blood borne colorectal cell reach liver first encounter hepatic capillary sinusoidal endothelial cell thus difference highly ht lmm poorly ht p liver metastatic sublines human colorectal cell examine interaction cell liver microvessel endothelial cell use hepatic sinusoidal endothelial hse lung microvessel endothelial mle cell condition medium measure growth motility stimulating activity release endothelial cell adhesion cell endothelial cell difference ability hse condition medium hse cm mle condition medium mle cm stimulate ht cell growth observe small significant increase rate adhesion highly metastatic,b,Liver Cancer
"Extra-luminal detection of assumed colonic tumor site by near-infrared laparoscopy. Localization of colorectal tumors during laparoscopic surgery is generally performed by tattooing into the submucosal layer of the colon. However, faint and diffuse tattoos may lead to difficulties in recognizing cancer sites, resulting in inappropriate resection of the colon. We previously demonstrated that yttrium oxide nanoparticles doped with the rare earth ions (ytterbium and erbium) (YNP) showed strong near-infrared (NIR) emission under NIR excitation (1550 nm emission with 980 nm excitation). NIR light can penetrate deep tissues. In this study, we developed an NIR laparoscopy imaging system and demonstrated its use for accurate resection of the colon in swine. The NIR laparoscopy system consisted of an NIR laparoscope, NIR excitation laser diode, and an NIR camera. Endo-clips coated with YNP (NIR clip), silicon rubber including YNP (NIR silicon mass), and YNP solution (NIR ink) were prepared as test NIR markers. We used a swine model to detect an assumed colon cancer site using NIR laparoscopy, followed by laparoscopic resection. The NIR markers were fixed at an assumed cancer site within the colon by endoscopy. An NIR laparoscope was then introduced into the abdominal cavity through a laparoscopy port. NIR emission from the markers in the swine colon was successfully recognized using the NIR laparoscopy imaging system. The position of the markers in the colon could be identified. Accurate resection of the colon was performed successfully by laparoscopic surgery under NIR fluorescence guidance. The presence of the NIR markers within the extirpated colon was confirmed, indicating resection of the appropriate site. NIR laparoscopic surgery is useful for colorectal cancer site recognition and accurate resection using laparoscopic surgery.","extra-luminal detection of assumed colonic tumor site by near-infrared laparoscopy. localization of colorectal tumors during laparoscopic surgery is generally performed by tattooing into the submucosal layer of the colon. however, faint and diffuse tattoos may lead to difficulties in recognizing cancer sites, resulting in inappropriate resection of the colon. we previously demonstrated that yttrium oxide nanoparticles doped with the rare earth ions (ytterbium and erbium) (ynp) showed strong near-infrared (nir) emission under nir excitation (1550 nm emission with 980 nm excitation). nir light can penetrate deep tissues. in this study, we developed an nir laparoscopy imaging system and demonstrated its use for accurate resection of the colon in swine. the nir laparoscopy system consisted of an nir laparoscope, nir excitation laser diode, and an nir camera. endo-clips coated with ynp (nir clip), silicon rubber including ynp (nir silicon mass), and ynp solution (nir ink) were prepared as test nir markers.",extra luminal detection assumed colonic site near infrared laparoscopy localization colorectal laparoscopic surgery generally perform tattoo submucosal layer colon however faint diffuse tattoo may lead difficulty recognize site result inappropriate resection colon previously demonstrate yttrium oxide nanoparticles dope rare earth ion ytterbium erbium ynp show strong near infrared nir emission nir excitation nm emission nm excitation nir light penetrate deep tissue develop nir laparoscopy image system demonstrate use accurate resection colon swine nir laparoscopy system consist nir laparoscope nir excitation laser diode nir camera endo clip coat ynp nir clip silicon rubber include ynp nir silicon mass ynp solution nir ink prepare test nir marker,a,Colon Cancer
"Demonstrating the undermining of science and health policy after the Fukushima nuclear accident by applying the Toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods. It is well known that science can be misused to hinder the resolution (i.e., the elimination and/or control) of a health problem. To recognize distorted and misapplied epidemiological science, a 33-item ""Toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods"" (hereinafter, the Toolkit) was published in 2021. Applying the Toolkit, we critically evaluated a review paper entitled, ""Lessons learned from Chernobyl and Fukushima on thyroid cancer screening and recommendations in the case of a future nuclear accident"" in Environment International in 2021, published by the SHAMISEN (Nuclear Emergency Situations - Improvement of Medical and Health Surveillance) international expert consortium. The article highlighted the claim that overdiagnosis of childhood thyroid cancers greatly increased the number of cases detected in ultrasound thyroid screening following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. However, the reasons cited in the SHAMISEN review paper for overdiagnosis in mass screening lacked important information about the high incidence of thyroid cancers after the accident. The SHAMISEN review paper ignored published studies of screening results in unexposed areas, and included an invalid comparison of screenings among children with screenings among adults. The review omitted the actual state of screening in Fukushima after the nuclear accident, in which only nodules > 5 mm in diameter were examined. The growth rate of thyroid cancers was not slow, as emphasized in the SHAMISEN review paper; evidence shows that cancers detected in second-round screening grew to more than 5 mm in diameter over a 2-year period. The SHAMISEN consortium used an unfounded overdiagnosis hypothesis and misguided evidence to refute that the excess incidence of thyroid cancer was attributable to the nuclear accident, despite the findings of ongoing ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer in Fukushima and around Chernobyl. By our evaluation, the SHAMISEN review paper includes 20 of the 33 items in the Toolkit that demonstrate the misuse of epidemiology. The International Agency for Research on Cancer meeting in 2017 and its publication cited in the SHAMISEN review paper includes 12 of the 33 items in the Toolkit. Finally, we recommend a few enhancements to the Toolkit to increase its utility.","demonstrating the undermining of science and health policy after the fukushima nuclear accident by applying the toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods. it is well known that science can be misused to hinder the resolution (i.e., the elimination and/or control) of a health problem. to recognize distorted and misapplied epidemiological science, a 33-item ""toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods"" (hereinafter, the toolkit) was published in 2021. applying the toolkit, we critically evaluated a review paper entitled, ""lessons learned from chernobyl and fukushima on thyroid cancer screening and recommendations in the case of a future nuclear accident"" in environment international in 2021, published by the shamisen (nuclear emergency situations - improvement of medical and health surveillance) international expert consortium. the article highlighted the claim that overdiagnosis of childhood thyroid cancers greatly increased the number of cases detected in ultrasound thyroid screening following the 2011 fukushima nuclear accident. however, the reasons cited",demonstrate undermining science health policy fukushima nuclear accident apply toolkit detect misused epidemiological method well know science misuse hinder resolution e elimination control health problem recognize distorted misapplied epidemiological science item toolkit detect misused epidemiological method hereinafter toolkit publish apply toolkit critically evaluate review paper entitle lesson learn chernobyl fukushima thyroid screening recommendation future nuclear accident environment international publish shamisen nuclear emergency situation improvement medical health surveillance international expert consortium article highlight claim overdiagnosis childhood thyroid greatly increase number detect ultrasound thyroid screening follow fukushima nuclear accident however reason cite,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Prognosis of male lung cancer patients with urinary cancer: a study from a national population-based analysis. Lung cancer accounts for the most cancer-related deaths in the world. Our previous study suggested the improved survival of lung cancer patients, mainly female patients, with subsequent metachronous primary breast cancer. However, whether the survival advantages of the two primaries are associated with patients' sex and the specific breast cancer is unclear. Whether male lung cancer patients with another primary may encounter the same survival advantage as female patients is also uncertain. The uncertainty hinders these patients from the potential benefit of lung cancer clinical trial. A total of 343 male lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (LCBC), 1539 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (BCLC), 1181 lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma (LCPC), 7426 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior prostate adenocarcinoma (PCLC), and patients with single bladder/prostate/lung (SLC) cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. Patients were classified into simultaneous two primary cancer (sTPC), metachronous two primary cancer 1 (mTPC1), or mTPC2 groups when interval time between two cancers was within 6 months, between 7 and 60 months, or over 60 months, respectively. Propensity matching score program was executed to match the two primary cancers with single primary. Cox regression and competing risk regression were performed to identify confounders associated with all-cause and cancer-specific survival, respectively. The major cancer-related and non-cancer-related death in the two primaries were lung cancer and heart disease, respectively. Median overall survival times since lung primary of LCBC and SLC were 97 and 17 months, respectively, and incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death in LCBC since lung malignancy was significantly lower (Coef. - 1.24, 95% CI - 1.49 to 0.99; SHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). Among the categorized groups, prognosis values of sTPC and mTPC2 groups were not statically different from that of the matched single lung cancer, whereas increased overall survival time and decreased incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death relative to the matched patients were observed in mTPC1 group (H.R 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.41; SHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47). Similar prognosis of LCPC relative to SLC was also observed. Furthermore, a generally improved survival relative to SLC was observed in PCLC (median survival times of PCLC and SLC were 17 and 12 months, respectively; Coef. - 0.32, 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.22; SHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85), whereas prognosis of BCLC was similar to the matched ones. These results hinted that survival of lung cancer patients might vary with prior cancer history. Further analysis among groups with the two primaries suggested that advanced bladder cancer was not associated with prognosis of patients with LCBC and BCLC. On the contrary, advanced prostate cancer was associated with all-cause and cancer-specific death in patients with PCLC but not in patients with LCPC. Compared with patients with single lung cancer, male lung cancer patients with subsequent bladder/prostate primary over 6 months experienced generally improved survival. These results were similar to our previous study regarding female lung cancer patients with another breast primary. On the contrary, male lung cancer patients with prior primary malignancy encountered varied prognosis: improved survival relative to single lung primary was observed in lung cancer with prior prostate cancer, whereas prognosis of lung cancer with prior bladder cancer was not different. Therefore, great attention was required to characterize prognosis of lung cancer patients with another primary in advance, which was essential to eliminate the potential bias when these patients were included into the clinical trials.","prognosis of male lung cancer patients with urinary cancer: a study from a national population-based analysis. lung cancer accounts for the most cancer-related deaths in the world. our previous study suggested the improved survival of lung cancer patients, mainly female patients, with subsequent metachronous primary breast cancer. however, whether the survival advantages of the two primaries are associated with patients' sex and the specific breast cancer is unclear. whether male lung cancer patients with another primary may encounter the same survival advantage as female patients is also uncertain. the uncertainty hinders these patients from the potential benefit of lung cancer clinical trial. a total of 343 male lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (lcbc), 1539 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (bclc), 1181 lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma (lcpc), 7426 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior prostate adenocarcinoma (pclc), and patients",prognosis male lung urinary national population base lung account related death world previous suggest improved survival lung mainly female subsequent metachronous primary breast however whether survival advantage two primary associate sex specific breast unclear whether male lung another primary may encounter survival advantage female also uncertain uncertainty hinders potential benefit lung trial total male lung adenocarcinoma subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma lcbc lung adenocarcinoma prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma bclc lung adenocarcinoma subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma lcpc lung adenocarcinoma prior prostate adenocarcinoma pclc,c,Lung Cancer
"LncRNA XIST/miR-34a axis modulates the cell proliferation and tumor growth of thyroid cancer through MET-PI3K-AKT signaling Thyroid cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in endocrine system. Further understanding and revealing the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer are indispensable for the development of effective diagnosis and treatments. In the present study, we attempted to provide novel basis for targeted therapy for thyroid cancer from the aspect of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction. The expression and cellular function of XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) was determined. miRNAs which may be direct targets of XIST were screened for from online GEO database and miR-34a was selected. Next, the predicted binding between XIST and miR-34a, and the dynamic effect of XIST and miR-34a on downstream MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)-PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT (α-serine/threonine-protein kinase) signaling was evaluated. XIST was significantly up-regulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines; XIST knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation in vivo and the tumor growth in vitro. Based on online database and online tool prediction results, miR-34a was underexpressed in thyroid cancer and might be a direct target of XIST. Herein, we confirmed the negative interaction between XIST and miR-34a; moreover, XIST knockdown could reduce the protein levels of MET, a downstream target of miR-34a, and the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. In thyroid cancer tissues, MET mRNA and protein levels of MET were up-regulated; MET was positively correlated with XIST while negatively correlated with miR-34a, further confirming that XIST serves as a ceRNA for miR-34a through sponging miR-34a, competing with MET for miR-34a binding, and finally modulating thyroid cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.

"Comparison of Secondary and Primary Thyroid Cancers: Patient Characteristics and Postoperative Outcomes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Patients with Primary and Secondary Thyroid Cancers. Secondary thyroid cancer is believed to lead to a more aggressive clinical course than primary thyroid cancer. We aim to examine the difference between primary and secondary thyroid cancer in terms of patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes at the national level. A cross-sectional study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for 2003–2010 was merged with County Health Rankings Data. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were used to identify adult patients with thyroid cancer. A total of 21,581 discharge records were included. Overall, 16,625 (77.0 %) patients had primary cancer, while the rest (23.0 %) had secondary cancer. Younger ( 65 years) patients, males, and those of White or Hispanic background were more likely to have secondary cancers (p < 0.05 each). The prevalence of secondary cancer was higher in communities of low health risk (24.0 % vs. 21.1 %; p < 0.024). Secondary cancer was more likely to be managed by total thyroidectomy (odds ratio [OR] 2.40, 95 % CI 2.12–2.73) and to require additional radical neck dissection (OR 12.51, 95 % CI 10.98–14.25). Patients with secondary thyroid cancers were at higher risk of postoperative complications (p < 0.01 each). The cost of secondary cancer management was significantly higher than primary cancer (US$12,449.00 ± 302.07 vs. US$7848.12 ± 149.05; p < 0.001). However, compared with intermediate-volume surgeons, the complication risk was lower for high-volume (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.24–0.92; p = 0.026).

"Curcumin inhibits human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of epidermal growth factor receptor through reducing the activity of the transcription factor Egr-1. High expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is found in a variety of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. EGFR has been identified as a rational target for anticancer therapy. Curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. We recently reported that curcumin inhibited the growth of human colon cancer-derived Moser cells by suppressing gene expression of cyclinD1 and EGFR. The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin inhibition of gene expression of EGFR in colon cancer cells. The generality of the inhibitory effect of curcumin on gene expression of EGFR was verified in other human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Promoter deletion assays and site-directed mutageneses identified a binding site for the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in egfr promoter as a putative curcumin response element in regulating the promoter activity of the gene in Moser cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that curcumin significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor Egr-1 to the curcumin response element. In addition, curcumin reduced the trans-activation activity of Egr-1 by suppressing egr-1 gene expression, which required interruption of the ERK signal pathway and reduction of the level of phosphorylation of Elk-1 and its activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that curcumin inhibited human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of EGFR through reducing the trans-activation activity of Egr-1. These results provided novel insights into the mechanisms of curcumin inhibition of colon cancer cell growth and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of colon cancer.","curcumin inhibits human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of epidermal growth factor receptor through reducing the activity of the transcription factor egr-1. high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) is found in a variety of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. egfr has been identified as a rational target for anticancer therapy. curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. we recently reported that curcumin inhibited the growth of human colon cancer-derived moser cells by suppressing gene expression of cyclind1 and egfr. the aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin inhibition of gene expression of egfr in colon cancer cells. the generality of the inhibitory effect of curcumin on gene expression of egfr was verified in other human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including caco-2 and ht-29 cells. promoter",curcumin inhibits human colon cell growth suppress gene expression epidermal growth factor receptor reduce activity transcription factor egr high expression epidermal growth factor receptor egfr find variety solid include colorectal egfr identify rational target anticancer therapy curcumin yellow pigment turmeric curry receive attention promising dietary supplement prevention recently report curcumin inhibit growth human colon derive moser cell suppress gene expression cyclind egfr present explore molecular mechanism underlie curcumin inhibition gene expression egfr colon cell generality inhibitory effect curcumin gene expression egfr verify human colon derive cell line include caco ht cell promoter,a,Colon Cancer

"Gallstones, cholecystectomy and risk of cancers of the liver, biliary tract and pancreas. To examine the association between gallstones and cholecystectomy, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study in Denmark. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of gallstones from 1977 to 1989 were identified from the Danish National Registry of Patients and followed up for cancer occurrence until death or the end of 1993 by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. Included in the cohort were 60 176 patients, with 471 450 person-years of follow-up. Cancer risks were estimated by standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) stratified by years of follow-up and by cholecystectomy status. Among patients without cholecystectomy, the risks at 5 or more years of follow-up were significantly elevated for cancers of liver (SIR = 2.0, CI = 1.2-3.1) and gallbladder (SIR = 2.7, CI = 1.5-4.4) and near unity for cancers of extrahepatic bile duct (SIR = 1.1), ampulla of Vater (SIR = 1.0) and pancreas (SIR = 1.1). The excess risk of liver cancer was seen only among patients with a history of hepatic disease. Among cholecystectomy patients, the risks at 5 or more years of follow-up declined for cancers of liver (SIR = 1.1) and extrahepatic bile duct (SIR = 0.7), but were elevated for cancers of ampulla of Vater (SIR = 2.0, CI = 1.0-3.7) and pancreas (SIR = 1.3, CI = 1.1-1.6).

"Incidence and mortality of liver cancer in China in 2011 Liver cancer is a common cancer with poor prognosis in China. In this study, the national population-based cancer registration data were used to evaluate and analyze liver cancer incidence and mortality in China in 2011 and provide a reference for liver cancer prevention and control. We collected and evaluated the incidence and mortality data of liver cancer in 2011 from 177 cancer registries with qualified data. These data were used in the final analysis including calculating crude, standardized, and truncated incidences and mortalities, and estimated new liver cancer cases and deaths using age-specific rates and the corresponding populations. The national census in 2000 and Segi’s population were used for age-standardized rates. The estimates of new liver cancer cases and deaths were 355,595 and 322,416, respectively, in China in 2011. The crude incidence, age-standardized rate of incidence by Chinese standard population (ASRIC), and age-standardized rate of incidence by world standard population (ASRIW) of liver cancer were 26.39/100,000, 19.48/100,000, and 19.10/100,000, respectively; the crude mortality, age-standardized rate of mortality by Chinese standard population (ASRMC), and age-standardized rate of mortality by world standard population (ASRMW) of liver cancer were 23.93/100,000,17.48/100,000, and 17.17/100,000, respectively.

Responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 Long Form Census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. First Nations- and non-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated with Poisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites). Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionally had higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lower incidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higher relative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only among First Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer was similar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed. First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy and programming. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to the significantly lower incidence observed for various cancer types. Novel methods for studying disparities in cancer incidence among First Nations people are required to support ongoing cancer control planning and advocacy.","cancer incidence among first nations adults in canada: follow-up of the 1991 census mortality cohort (1992-2009) estimate site-specific cancer incidence rates for a wide range of cancers in first nations adults in canada, and compare these with rates in non-aboriginal adults. responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 long form census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. first nations- and non-aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. the sex- and site-specific relative risks (rr) of cancer in first nations compared to those in non-aboriginal adults were estimated with poisson regression. results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of canada (four most common cancer sites). compared to non-aboriginal adults, first nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-hodgkin",incidence among first nation adult canada follow census mortality cohort estimate site specific incidence rate wide range first nation adult canada compare rate non aboriginal adult response person age old long form census link national mortality database first nation non aboriginal specific incidence rate age standardize world standard population sex site specific relative risk rr first nation compare non aboriginal adult estimate poisson regression result stratify residence reserve combine region canada four common site compare non aboriginal adult first nation high incidence colon rectum kidney cervix liver low incidence prostate breast bladder uterus ovary brain well non hodgkin,d,Stomach Cancer
"Aspirin inhibited the metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of toll-like receptor 4 The metastasis of colorectal cancer frequently tends to liver, which is one of the three leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Growing evidence showed that aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. However, the potential mechanism has not been fully understood. Mouse splenic vein metastasis assay was used to examine the metastatic ability of colon cancer cells in vivo. And wound healing and transwell assay were applied to detect the metastasis potential of C26 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines in vitro. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to explore Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in colon cancer cell lines. The functions of TLR4 in the migration of the colon cancer cell line were analyzed by infecting cells with lentivirus containing TLR4 siRNA. We demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) could enhance the metastasis potential of C26 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines. However, aspirin effectively decreased the metastasis capacity of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that the enhancement of LPS on the migration of colon cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype demonstrated a TLR4-dependent manner. Aspirin treatment lead to the downregulation of TLR4 on C26 cells which resulted in the decrease of C26 cells migration and EMT phenotype that induced by LPS. Additionally, the inhibitory effect from aspirin on the expression of TLR4 on C26 cells leads to the downregulation of NF-κB. The results of our study indicate that LPS origin from intestinal flora may promote the metastasis of colon cancer to liver and aspirin may inhibit the metastasis of colon cancer by inhibiting the expression of TLR4.","aspirin inhibited the metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of toll-like receptor 4 the metastasis of colorectal cancer frequently tends to liver, which is one of the three leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. growing evidence showed that aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. however, the potential mechanism has not been fully understood. mouse splenic vein metastasis assay was used to examine the metastatic ability of colon cancer cells in vivo. and wound healing and transwell assay were applied to detect the metastasis potential of c26 and hct116 colon cancer cell lines in vitro. rt-pcr and western blotting were used to explore toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) expression in colon cancer cell lines. the functions of tlr4 in the migration of the colon cancer cell line were analyzed by infecting cells with lentivirus containing tlr4 sirna. we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides (lps) could enhance the metastasis",aspirin inhibit metastasis colon cell inhibit expression toll like receptor metastasis colorectal frequently tend liver one three lead cause relate death worldwide grow evidence show aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis colorectal however potential mechanism fully understood mouse splenic vein metastasis assay use examine metastatic ability colon cell vivo wound healing transwell assay apply detect metastasis potential c hct colon cell line vitro rt pcr western blotting use explore toll like receptor tlr expression colon cell line function tlr migration colon cell line analyze infect cell lentivirus contain tlr sirna demonstrate lipopolysaccharides lp could enhance metastasis,a,Colon Cancer
"Autophagy-dependent generation of Axin2+ cancer stem-like cells promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in liver cirrhosis. Autophagy is a pathophysiological phenomenon in liver cirrhosis that can further progress into hepatocarcinoma. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. To investigate the precise mechanism related to the origin of CSCs in liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, we labeled Axin2+ hepatic cells with EGFP in Axin2Cre;Rosa26EGFP transgenic rats, and then stratified clinical and rat liver cirrhosis samples by autophagy flux. Clinical follow-up and lineage tracing in transgenic rat liver cirrhosis revealed that while Axin2/EGFP+ hepatic cells were present in normal livers and cirrhotic livers without aberrant autophagy, hepatic Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells were generated exclusively in cirrhotic livers with aberrant autophagy and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. Aberrant autophagy in liver cirrhosis resulted in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, leading to activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in sorted hepatic Axin2/EGFP+ cells and their transition into Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells that possess CSC properties. In a transgenic rat liver cirrhosis model, induction or inhibition of autophagy in cirrhotic livers by systemic administration of rapamycin or chloroquine or transfection with Atg3- and Atg7-shRNAs significantly induced or suppressed HGF expression, which in turn increased or reduced generation of EGFP+CD90+ hepatic cells by activating or inactivating Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling, thereby promoting or preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. Systemic treatment with HGF-shRNA, SP600125 or stattic also reduced generation of EGFP(Axin2)+ hepatic cell-originated CD90+ CSCs in aberrant autophagic cirrhotic livers by inactivating HGF/Met/JNK or HGF/Met/STAT3 signaling, further preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. These data suggest that activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in Axin2+ hepatic cells via autophagy-dependent HGF expression and the resultant generation of Axin2+CD90+ CSCs is a major mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic livers.","autophagy-dependent generation of axin2+ cancer stem-like cells promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in liver cirrhosis. autophagy is a pathophysiological phenomenon in liver cirrhosis that can further progress into hepatocarcinoma. liver cancer stem cells (cscs) are believed to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. to investigate the precise mechanism related to the origin of cscs in liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, we labeled axin2+ hepatic cells with egfp in axin2cre;rosa26egfp transgenic rats, and then stratified clinical and rat liver cirrhosis samples by autophagy flux. clinical follow-up and lineage tracing in transgenic rat liver cirrhosis revealed that while axin2/egfp+ hepatic cells were present in normal livers and cirrhotic livers without aberrant autophagy, hepatic axin2/egfp+cd90+ cells were generated exclusively in cirrhotic livers with aberrant autophagy and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. aberrant autophagy in liver cirrhosis resulted in hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) expression, leading to activation of met/jnk and met/stat3 signaling in sorted hepatic axin2/egfp+ cells and their transition into axin2/egfp+cd90+ cells that possess",autophagy dependent generation axin stem like cell promotes hepatocarcinogenesis liver cirrhosis autophagy pathophysiological phenomenon liver cirrhosis progress hepatocarcinoma liver stem cell cscs believe initiate hepatocarcinogenesis investigate precise mechanism relate origin cscs liver cirrhosis hepatocarcinogenesis axin hepatic cell egfp axin cre rosa egfp transgenic rat stratify rat liver cirrhosis sample autophagy flux follow lineage tracing transgenic rat liver cirrhosis reveal axin egfp hepatic cell present normal liver cirrhotic liver without aberrant autophagy hepatic axin egfp cd cell generate exclusively cirrhotic liver aberrant autophagy promoted hepatocarcinogenesis aberrant autophagy liver cirrhosis result hepatocyte growth factor hgf expression lead activation meet jnk meet stat signal sort hepatic axin egfp cell transition axin egfp cd cell possess,b,Liver Cancer
"Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer in Canada and their costs Escalating health care costs have made it imperative to evaluate the resources required to diagnose and treat major illnesses in Canadians. For Canadian men, lung cancer is not only the most common malignancy, but also the major cancer killer. As of 1994, lung cancer is expected to overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. This paper presents a detailed description of the methodology used to determine the direct health care costs associated with 'standard' diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for lung cancer in Canada in 1988. Clinical algorithms were developed for each stage of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The algorithms were designed to take the form of decision trees for each clinical stage of lung cancer. The proportion of patients assigned to each branch was based upon questionnaire responses obtained from thoracic surgeons and radiation oncologists when presented with clinical scenarios, and information from provincial cancer registries. Direct care costs were derived primarily from one provincial fee schedule (Ontario), and costing information obtained during the conduct of several Canadian clinical trials in lung cancer. Direct costs for diagnosis and initial treatment of NSCLC (excluding relapse and terminal care costs) ranged from $17,889 for the surgery/post-operative radiotherapy arm of stages I and II to $6,333 for the supportive care arm (stage IV). The cost of determining relapse for NSCLC was estimated to be $1,528, and terminal care costs, which included palliative radiotherapy and hospitalisation, were $10,331. Direct costs for diagnosis and initial treatment of SCLC ranged from $18,691 for limited stage disease to $4,739 for the supportive care arm of extensive disease. The cost of diagnosing relapse for SCLC was estimated to be $1,590, and terminal care costs averaged $9,966. This report provides an estimate of the Canadian costs of managing lung cancer by stage and treatment modality. Because the actual costs of all components of care are not available from any combination of sources, these cost estimates must be viewed as an idealised estimate of the cost of lung cancer management. However, we believe that the lung cancer costing model that we have developed provides a level of sophistication which gives a reasonable estimate of the cost per case of treating NSCLC and SCLC.","diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer in canada and their costs escalating health care costs have made it imperative to evaluate the resources required to diagnose and treat major illnesses in canadians. for canadian men, lung cancer is not only the most common malignancy, but also the major cancer killer. as of 1994, lung cancer is expected to overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. this paper presents a detailed description of the methodology used to determine the direct health care costs associated with 'standard' diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for lung cancer in canada in 1988. clinical algorithms were developed for each stage of non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) and small-cell lung cancer (sclc). the algorithms were designed to take the form of decision trees for each clinical stage of lung cancer. the proportion of patients assigned to each branch was based upon questionnaire responses",diagnostic therapeutic approach lung canada cost escalate health care cost make imperative evaluate resource require diagnose treat major illness canadian canadian men lung common malignancy also major killer lung expect overtake breast lead cause death woman paper present detailed description methodology use determine direct health care cost associate standard diagnostic therapeutic approach lung canada algorithm develop stage non small cell lung nsclc small cell lung sclc algorithm design take form decision tree stage lung proportion assign branch base upon questionnaire response,c,Lung Cancer

"A new approach to breast cancer analysis through histopathological images using MI, MD binary, and eight class classifying techniques Globally, cancer is the second deadliest disease in the world. The most familiar type of cancers affecting human beings is lung, colorectal, breast, cervical, stomach, thyroid, and stomach cancer. An individual affected by cancer suffers from physical, emotional, and financial restrain. The proper maintenance of the health system with early detection reduces the cancer death rate. Breast cancer is the most serious crisis that affects a major percentage of women. The superfluous intensification of cells in the breast is the main reason for breast cancer. The histopathological images are very useful in the diagnosis of breast cancer. However, it is a time-intensive and tedious task requiring long years of pathologist training. Today’s digital advancements can be exploited for automating this task. This paper presents a new learning approach for automating breast cancer Classifying is histopathological images into magnification independent (MI) and magnification dependent (MD) eight-class and binary classifying. For learning, we use the deep neural network-ResNet-18 and this is provided with Image Net training. The proposed learning technique mainly depends on the accurate tuning of the block-wise approach in which the deep network model's two terminal residual blocks can be educated. Additionally, we reinforced the proposed approach’s adaptability with Global Contrast Normalization and a three-fold rise in details concerning training data. The evaluation is carried out on Break His dataset. The results protrude our proposed technique to be effective in classifying breast cancer histopathological images into MI and MD eight-class and binary classes.

"Syntenin overexpression in human lung cancer tissue and serum is associated with poor prognosis Lung cancer is the major malignant tumour. The present study was conducted to determine the expression level of syntenin in lung cancer tissues and serum from lung cancer patients and to explore its clinical significance. Syntenin expression levels were determined in paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue specimens (n = 191) using immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expressions of syntenin in fresh lung cancer tissues and the paracancerous tissues were examined by RT-qPCR (n = 25). Syntenin and VEGF expression levels were measured in serum from patients with lung cancer (n = 60) and control subjects (n = 30) using ELISA. The associations between syntenin and the clinicopathological features or prognosis in 191 patients with lung cancer were analysed. The correlation between the syntenin and VEGF levels in serum from 60 lung cancer patients was analysed. The expression levels of syntenin were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than in paracancerous tissues based on immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, and elevated syntenin expression was significantly associated with tumour size (P = 0.002), TNM stage (P = 0.020), tumour distant metastasis (P = 0.033), overall survival (OS) (P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.001).

"An age-period-cohort analysis of mortality rates for stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer among prefectures in Japan, 1999–2018 Although change in the birth cohort effect on cancer mortality rates is known to be highly associated with the decreasing rates of age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Japan, the differences in the trends of cohort effect for representative cancer types among the prefectures remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the decreasing rate of cohort effects among the prefectures for representative cancer types using age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Data on stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer mortality for each prefecture and the population data from 1999 to 2018 were obtained from the Vital Statistics in Japan. Mortality data for individuals aged 50 to 79 years grouped in 5-year increments were used, and corresponding birth cohorts born 1920–1924 through 1964–1978 were used for analysis. We estimated the effects of age, period, and cohort on each type of mortality rate for each prefecture by sex. Then, we calculated the decreasing rates of cohort effects for each prefecture. We also calculated the mortality rate ratio of each prefecture compared with all of Japan for cohorts using the estimates. As a result of APC analysis, we found that the decreasing rates of period effects were small and that there was a little difference in the decreasing rates among prefectures for all types of cancer among both sexes. On the other hand, there was a large difference in the decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer mortality rates among prefectures, particularly for men. For men, the decreasing rates of cohort effects in cohorts born between 1920–1924 and 1964–1978 varied among prefectures, ranging from 4.1 to 84.0% for stomach cancer and from 20.2 to 92.4% for liver cancers, respectively. On the other hand, the differences in the decreasing rates of cohort effects among prefectures for colorectal and lung cancer were relatively smaller.

"ACTL6A expression promotes invasion, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of colon cancer Metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with advanced stage colon cancer. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in invasion and metastasis. Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A) is vital for embryogenesis and differentiation and is also critical for metastasis and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma, as observed in our previous study. In the present study, we further explored the role of ACTL6A in colon cancer metastasis. ACTL6A expression levels were analyzed in normal colon, colon adenoma and colon cancer specimens using public databases and tissue samples. ACTL6A expression and its association with clinicopathologic features of colon cancer patients were also analyzed. ACTL6A-overexpression and ACTL6A-knockdown colon cancer cells were used to perform cytological experiments to explore the potential biological function of ACTL6A in metastasis and EMT in colon cancer. The data from both the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Oncomine databases showed that ACTL6A expression levels in colon adenoma and cancer were higher than those in normal colon samples. The ACTL6A expression level in fresh colon cancer specimens was also higher than that in the corresponding adjacent normal colon specimens. Patients with high ACTL6A expression directly correlated with advanced pT status, distant metastasis, poor differentiation and microvascular/perineural invasion. ACTL6A overexpression promoted migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, whereas ACTL6A knockdown exhibited the opposite effect in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated that ACTL6A promoted EMT in colon cancer cells in vitro. Our findings indicate that ACTL6A exhibits pro-tumor function and acts as an EMT activator in colon cancer. ACTL6A may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.","actl6a expression promotes invasion, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of colon cancer metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with advanced stage colon cancer. epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt) plays an important role in invasion and metastasis. actin-like 6a (actl6a) is vital for embryogenesis and differentiation and is also critical for metastasis and emt in hepatocellular carcinoma, as observed in our previous study. in the present study, we further explored the role of actl6a in colon cancer metastasis. actl6a expression levels were analyzed in normal colon, colon adenoma and colon cancer specimens using public databases and tissue samples. actl6a expression and its association with clinicopathologic features of colon cancer patients were also analyzed. actl6a-overexpression and actl6a-knockdown colon cancer cells were used to perform cytological experiments to explore the potential biological function of actl6a in metastasis and emt in colon cancer. the data from both the gene expression omnibus (geo)",actl expression promote invasion metastasis epithelial mesenchymal transition colon metastasis main cause death advanced stage colon epithelial mesenchymal transition emt play important role invasion metastasis actin like actl vital embryogenesis differentiation also critical metastasis emt hepatocellular carcinoma observe previous present far explore role actl colon metastasis actl expression level analyze normal colon colon adenoma colon specimens use public database tissue sample actl expression association clinicopathologic feature colon also analyze actl overexpression actl knockdown colon cell use perform cytological experiment explore potential biological function actl metastasis emt colon data gene expression omnibus geo,a,Colon Cancer
"Partial purification of organ-specific neoantigens from human colon and breast cancer by affinity chromatography with human tumour-specific gamma-globulin. Organ-specific neoantigens (TA) shed from the tumours of patients with metastatic breast or colon cancer and which had filtered into the urine were partially purified by a combination of physicochemical methods and affinity chromatography. TA activity of the isolated materials was monitored by the blocking Tube LAI assay. Urinary protein was precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulphate. Albumin was removed by affinity chromatography with blue Sepharose CL-6B. Affinity columns of human IgG were prepared from sera of patients whose leucocytes were LAI+ to the breast- or colon-cancer extracts. The anti-breast-TA affinity column bound the TA in the urine of patients with metastatic breast cancer but not that of patients with metastatic colon cancer. The TA in urine of patients with metastatic colon cancer was bound by the anti-colon-TA affinity column. Analysis by SDS PAGE revealed that the isolates with and without TA activity were composed mostly of urinary protein which had bound nonspecifically to the human IgG affinity columns. With an affinity column of anti-NHS and Protein A, some of the contaminants were removed, to reveal SDD PAGE unique bands at about 38,000 and 12,000 mol. wt in the isolate with breast-TA activity. Rabbit antisera, raised to the material that had bound nonspecically to the anti-breast-TA affinity column, were used as an anti-nonspecific affinity column to remove the contaminants in the isolates from the affinity columns of anti-breast TA and anti-colon TA. After passage through the anti-nonspecific affinity column, the material that contained the putative breast or colon cancer TA revealed a unique band at about 38,000-40,000 mol. wt and residual fine bands at about 25,000-30,000 mol. wt. Both the control material and material with TA activity had similar bands at about 25,000 and 50,000 mol. wt.

"The effects and mechanisms of Xiaoyao San on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rat based on transcriptomics and proteomics analysis. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and is closely associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Despite its increasing prevalence and potential progression to severe liver conditions, there is currently no approved pharmaceutical intervention for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulations, such as Xiaoyao San (XYS), have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating NAFLD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of XYS in NAFLD. A rat model of NAFLD was established using a high-fat diet (HFD). The chemical constituents of XYS were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed to identify potential biological targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of XYS. The results were validated using ELISA and Western blotting. UPLC-MS/MS identified 225 prototype chemical components of XYS in the blood. XYS significantly reduced body weight, liver index, and Lee's index in NAFLD model rats. It ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, down-regulated serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, TG, TC, LDL-C, FBG, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and ROS, and up-regulated HDL-C levels. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed that XYS modulated key signaling pathways, including cAMP, TGF-β, NF-κB, and necroptosis. Specifically, XYS down-regulated the expressions of NF-κB, p-NF-κB, FOXO1, TGF-β1, RIP3, and p-MLKL, while up-regulating cAMP, PKA, p-PKA, and PPARα. XYS improves NAFLD by regulating the cAMP/PKA-mediated PPARα, FOXO1, and NF-κB signaling pathways. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of XYS in NAFLD and supports its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention for this condition.","the effects and mechanisms of xiaoyao san on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rat based on transcriptomics and proteomics analysis. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and is closely associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. despite its increasing prevalence and potential progression to severe liver conditions, there is currently no approved pharmaceutical intervention for nafld. traditional chinese medicine (tcm) formulations, such as xiaoyao san (xys), have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating nafld, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. this study employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of xys in nafld. a rat model of nafld was established using a high-fat diet (hfd). the chemical constituents of xys were analyzed using uplc-ms/ms. transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed to identify potential biological targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of xys. the results were validated",effect mechanism xiaoyao san nonalcoholic fatty liver rat base transcriptomics proteomics nonalcoholic fatty liver nafld characterize excessive lipid accumulation hepatocytes closely associate metabolic disturbance obesity dyslipidemia insulin resistance despite increase prevalence potential progression severe liver condition currently approved pharmaceutical intervention nafld traditional chinese medicine tcm formulation xiaoyao san xy show therapeutic efficacy treat nafld underlying mechanism remain unclear employ multi omics approach elucidate therapeutic mechanism xy nafld rat model nafld establish use high fat diet hfd chemical constituent xy analyze use uplc transcriptomics proteomics perform identify potential biological target signal pathway involve therapeutic effect xy result validated,b,Liver Cancer
"Epidural analgesia associated with better survival in colon cancer. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for potentially curable colon cancer. Otherwise, the surgical stress response might increase the likelihood of cancer dissemination during and after cancer surgery. There is growing evidence that the type of anaesthesia during cancer surgery plays a role in the metastatic process. Therefore, we assessed if the method of anaesthesia is associated with long-term survival after colon cancer surgery. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted including 588 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery, TNM stage I–IV, in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital between 1995 and 2003. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for statistical analysis. Adjustments were made for age, sex, comorbidity, TNM stage, chemotherapy, emergency surgery status and year of incidence. Of the 588 primary colon cancer patients with a median age of 70 years, 399 (68 %) patients underwent colon surgery with epidural anaesthesia, whilst 189 (32 %) patients were operated without epidural anaesthesia. Five-year survival for patients not receiving epidural analgesia was 42 % versus 51 % for patients receiving epidural analgesia (p = 0.03). This effect remained after adjustment for relevant patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics (hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.59), p = 0.01). Subgroup analysis in patients of 80 years and older (n = 100) showed also a better overall survival after receiving epidural analgesia (HR 1.74 (95 % CI 1.11–2.72), p = 0.01). Epidural analgesia during colon cancer surgery was associated with a better overall survival. Prospective trials evaluating the effects of locoregional analgesia on colon cancer recurrence are warranted.","epidural analgesia associated with better survival in colon cancer. surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for potentially curable colon cancer. otherwise, the surgical stress response might increase the likelihood of cancer dissemination during and after cancer surgery. there is growing evidence that the type of anaesthesia during cancer surgery plays a role in the metastatic process. therefore, we assessed if the method of anaesthesia is associated with long-term survival after colon cancer surgery. a retrospective single-centre study was conducted including 588 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery, tnm stage i–iv, in the jeroen bosch hospital between 1995 and 2003. the cox proportional hazard model was used for statistical analysis. adjustments were made for age, sex, comorbidity, tnm stage, chemotherapy, emergency surgery status and year of incidence. of the 588 primary colon cancer patients with a median age of 70 years, 399 (68 %) patients underwent colon surgery with epidural anaesthesia,",epidural analgesia associate good survival colon surgery remain mainstay potentially curable colon otherwise surgical stress response might increase likelihood dissemination surgery grow evidence type anaesthesia surgery play role metastatic process therefore assess method anaesthesia associate long term survival colon surgery retrospective single centre conduct include underwent colorectal surgery tnm stage iv jeroen bosch hospital cox proportional hazard model use statistical adjustment make age sex comorbidity tnm stage chemotherapy emergency surgery status year incidence primary colon median age year underwent colon surgery epidural anaesthesia,a,Colon Cancer
"Identification of valid reference genes for gene expression studies of human stomach cancer by reverse transcription-qPCR Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression. Target gene expression levels are usually normalized to a consistently expressed reference gene also known as internal standard, in the same sample. However, much effort has not been expended thus far in the search for reference genes suitable for the study of stomach cancer using RT-qPCR, although selection of optimal reference genes is critical for interpretation of results. We assessed the suitability of six possible reference genes, beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal subunit L29 (RPL29) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) in 20 normal and tumor stomach tissue pairs of stomach cancer patients and 6 stomach cancer cell lines, by RT-qPCR. Employing expression stability analyses using NormFinder and geNorm algorithms we determined the order of performance of these reference genes and their variation values. This RT-qPCR study showed that there are statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in the expression levels of HPRT1 and 18S rRNA in 'normal-' versus 'tumor stomach tissues'. The stability analyses by geNorm suggest B2M-GAPDH, as best reference gene combination for 'stomach cancer cell lines'; RPL29-HPRT1, for 'all stomach tissues'; and ACTB-18S rRNA, for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. NormFinder also identified B2M as the best reference gene for 'stomach cancer cell lines', RPL29-B2M for 'all stomach tissues', and 18S rRNA-ACTB for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. The comparisons of normalized expression of the target gene, GPNMB, showed different interpretation of target gene expression depend on best single reference gene or combination. This study validated RPL29 and RPL29-B2M as the best single reference genes and combination, for RT-qPCR analysis of 'all stomach tissues', and B2M and B2M-GAPDH as the best single reference gene and combination, for 'stomach cancer cell lines'.

"Iodized oil enhances the thermal effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound on ablating experimental liver cancer. The influence of the biological medium on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for ablating experimental liver cancer was studied. In study 1, the temperature rise in the focal zone in the presence of iodized oil or castor oil was observed in vitro. The results showed that HIFU with iodized oil produced a higher and faster temperature rise than did HIFU with castor oil, whether high-power (500 W/cm2) or relatively low-power (136 W/cm2) conditions were used (P=0.0008 and P=0.0004 respectively). With the excised liver samples, the temperature also rose higher and more rapidly after injection of iodized oil into the liver than when castor oil was injected (P=0.0239), and the target liver tissue revealed more radically and extensive destruction with iodized oil than with castor oil. In study 2, 48 nude mice, bearing primary liver cancer LTNM4 implanted subcutaneously, were randomly divided into four groups. Group I (n=12) were the controls, group II (n=12) were injected with iodized oil alone, group III (n=12) received HIFU treatement, and group IV (n=12) were exposed to HIFU after iodized oil injection. Significant inhibition of tumor growth was seen in groups III and IV as compared with group I or group II (P<0.05), the tumor growth inhibition rate on the 28th day after treatment being 87% and 93% respectively. Significantly improved survival was noted in groups III and IV compared with groups I and II (P<0.05). Histologically, group IV showed more complete tumor necrosis than did group III.

"Expression of ANGPTL2 and its impact on papillary thyroid cancer Although the most thyroid carcinoma patients have good prognosis, around 20% of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients have a high rate of metastasis and recurrence after routine treatment, which causes high lethality with these patients. Tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion are important predictors of PTC invasiveness and are key factors in cancer-related death. Angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2), a secreted protein which belongs to the angiopoietin (ANGPTL) family, was reported to be involved in the regulation of several different type of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, whether ANGPTL2 plays a role in the progression of PTC, particularly in metastasis and recurrence of PTC, remains unclear. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of ANGPTL2 in PTC and normal thyroid, as well as para-cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the impact of ANGPTL2 on PTC cell proliferation, metastasis, recurrence and invasion was assessed to investigate the possibility whether ANGPTL2 may become a novel target for PTC therapy and cancer prognosis. The level of ANGPTL2 in PTC and para-cancerous tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The biological effect of ANGPTL2 on thyroid cancer cell proliferation and metastasis was investigated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, cell scratch test, and transwell assay. Correlations of ANGPTL2 expression levels with proliferation, migration, and metastasis of thyroid cancer were assessed with the TCGA data set and analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the utility of ANGPTL2 as a biomarker for prediction of thyroid cancer. Survival analysis was performed using the thyroid cancer database in K–M Plotter to detect correlations between survival time and ANGPTL2 levels. Current study revealed that: (1) ANGPTL2 was highly expressed in thyroid cancer in comparison with adjacent normal thyroid tissue; (2) ANGPTL2 expression was increased with thyroid tumor progression; (3) ANGPTL2 increased proliferation of thyroid cancer cells; (4) ANGPTL2 promoted migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells; (5) high level of ANGPTL2 in thyroid cancer patients were significantly associated with a poor prognosis. The patients showed a higher metastasis and recurrence rate. ANGPTL2 promoted and enhanced proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. ANGPTL2 may be considered as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer patients. Further evaluation needs to be done to analyze the possibility of taking ANGPTL2 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for papillary thyroid cancer.","expression of angptl2 and its impact on papillary thyroid cancer although the most thyroid carcinoma patients have good prognosis, around 20% of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) patients have a high rate of metastasis and recurrence after routine treatment, which causes high lethality with these patients. tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion are important predictors of ptc invasiveness and are key factors in cancer-related death. angiopoietin-like 2 (angptl2), a secreted protein which belongs to the angiopoietin (angptl) family, was reported to be involved in the regulation of several different type of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. however, whether angptl2 plays a role in the progression of ptc, particularly in metastasis and recurrence of ptc, remains unclear. hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of angptl2 in ptc and normal thyroid, as well as para-cancerous tissue. furthermore, the impact of angptl2 on ptc cell proliferation, metastasis, recurrence and invasion",expression angptl impact papillary thyroid although thyroid carcinoma good prognosis around papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc high rate metastasis recurrence routine cause high lethality proliferation metastasis invasion important predictor ptc invasiveness key factor relate death angiopoietin like angptl secrete protein belong angiopoietin angptl family report involve regulation several different type cell proliferation metastasis however whether angptl play role progression ptc particularly metastasis recurrence ptc remain unclear hence evaluate level angptl ptc normal thyroid well para cancerous tissue furthermore impact angptl ptc cell proliferation metastasis recurrence invasion,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Family history of gastric cancer: a correlation between epidemiologic findings and clinical data. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind gastric cancer are still unclear. Its familial aggregation, on the other hand, has been very well documented by many epidemiologists. Nonetheless, only a limited number of studies have analyzed possible correlations between demographic and clinical data. Between January 1988 and August 2004, 541 patients underwent gastric resection with a curative intent at our department; demographic information, laboratory data, imaging, operative notes, and pathology reports were available for all patients. During 2004 we conducted a series of structured interviews with the surviving patients or their closest relatives regarding oncological family history, limited to first-degree relatives. Family history could be obtained in 383 patients (70.8%). Gastric cancer was by far the most frequently associated tumor: 21.9% of the overall number of tumors reported in the family histories were gastric cancers. Patients were also subdivided into those having at least one other family member with stomach cancer (71 patients; 18.5%) and those with no relatives affected by gastric cancer (312 patients; 81.5%). No statistically significant differences between the groups were observed regarding the primary tumor location, size, pTNM classification, and ABO or Rh blood types. However, the intestinal histotype was significantly (P = 0.015) more frequently represented in individuals with at least one family member affected by gastric cancer compared with those with no relatives with stomach cancer (71.8% vs 55.1%, respectively).

"Knowledge About Gastrointestinal Cancers in People Referred for Endoscopy and Colonoscopy During a Screening Program: a Cross-sectional Study in Guilan, North of Iran The most northern and northwestern regions of Iran are at a high risk for gastrointestinal cancers. In this study, we evaluated knowledge of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy screening. This cross-sectional study was carried out among 461 people who were under the patronage of a local relief foundation and referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy to the Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease Research Center (GLDRC), Rasht, north of Iran, from March 2016 to March 2017. A well-defined two-sectioned questionnaire was carried out for each group. Overall, 300 and 161 individuals were in the gastric and colon cancer knowledge group, respectively. The level of knowledge in various areas of gastric and colon cancer was desirable. In general, the average of different domains in gastric and colon cancer knowledge questions were 20.2 ± 6.6 and 19.2 ± 4.9, with the knowledge level higher than the mean in gastric cancer (58%) and colon cancer (67.1%). The mean score of knowledge of GI cancers in terms of risk factor indicated a significant relationship between BMI and alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, a meaningful relationship between symptoms and BMI with knowledge was declared. About domains of colon cancer, there was a significant relationship between younger age and knowledge in the risk factor. The results of this study can provide an opportunity to formulate strategies to achieve goals, especially in the field of education, prevention, and control of the disease by raising knowledge for the general public and educating people who are responsible for providing and delivering health services to this community.","knowledge about gastrointestinal cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy during a screening program: a cross-sectional study in guilan, north of iran the most northern and northwestern regions of iran are at a high risk for gastrointestinal cancers. in this study, we evaluated knowledge of gastrointestinal (gi) cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy screening. this cross-sectional study was carried out among 461 people who were under the patronage of a local relief foundation and referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy to the gastrointestinal and liver disease research center (gldrc), rasht, north of iran, from march 2016 to march 2017. a well-defined two-sectioned questionnaire was carried out for each group. overall, 300 and 161 individuals were in the gastric and colon cancer knowledge group, respectively. the level of knowledge in various areas of gastric and colon cancer was desirable. in general, the average of different domains in gastric and",knowledge gastrointestinal people refer endoscopy colonoscopy screening program cross sectional guilan north iran northern northwestern region iran high risk gastrointestinal evaluate knowledge gastrointestinal gi people refer endoscopy colonoscopy screening cross sectional carry among people patronage local relief foundation refer endoscopy colonoscopy gastrointestinal liver research center gldrc rasht north iran march march well define two sectioned questionnaire carry group overall individual gastric colon knowledge group respectively level knowledge various area gastric colon desirable general average different domain gastric,a,Colon Cancer
"A retrospective cohort study of patients with stomach and liver cancers: the impact of comorbidity and ethnicity on cancer care and outcomes. Background: Comorbidity has an adverse impact on cancer survival partly through its negative impact on receipt of curative treatment. Comorbidity is unevenly distributed within populations, with some ethnic and socioeconomic groups having considerably higher burden. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships between comorbidity, ethnicity, receipt of treatment, and cancer survival among patients with stomach and liver cancer in New Zealand. Methods: Using the New Zealand Cancer Registry, Māori patients diagnosed with stomach and liver cancers were identified (n = 269), and compared with a randomly selected group of non-Māori patients (n = 255). Clinical and outcome data were collected from medical records, and the administrative hospitalisation and mortality databases. Logistic and Cox regression modelling with multivariable adjustment were used to examine the impacts of ethnicity and comorbidity on receipt of treatment, and the impact of these variables on all-cause and cancer specific survival. Results: More than 70% of patients had died by two years post-diagnosis. As comorbidity burden increased among those with Stage I-III disease, the likelihood that the patient would receive curative surgery decreased (e.g. C3 Index score 6 vs 0, adjusted OR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.78) and risk of mortality increased (e.g. C3 Index score 6 vs 0, adjusted all-cause HR: 1.44, 95% CI 0.93-2.23). Receipt of curative surgery reduced this excess mortality, in some cases substantially; but the extent to which this occurred varied by level of comorbidity. Māori patients had somewhat higher levels of comorbidity (34% in highest comorbidity category compared with 23% for non-Māori) and poorer survival that was not explained by age, sex, site, stage, comorbidity or receipt of curative surgery (adjusted cancer-specific HR: 1.36, 95% CI 0.97-1.90; adjusted all-cause HR: 1.33, 95% CI 0.97-1.82). Access to healthcare factors accounted for 25-36% of this survival difference. Conclusions: Patients with comorbidity were substantially less likely to receive curative surgery and more likely to die than those without comorbidity. Receipt of curative surgery markedly reduced their excess mortality. Despite no discernible difference in likelihood of curative treatment receipt, Māori remained more likely to die than non-Māori even after adjusting for confounding and mediating variables.","a retrospective cohort study of patients with stomach and liver cancers: the impact of comorbidity and ethnicity on cancer care and outcomes. background: comorbidity has an adverse impact on cancer survival partly through its negative impact on receipt of curative treatment. comorbidity is unevenly distributed within populations, with some ethnic and socioeconomic groups having considerably higher burden. the aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships between comorbidity, ethnicity, receipt of treatment, and cancer survival among patients with stomach and liver cancer in new zealand. methods: using the new zealand cancer registry, māori patients diagnosed with stomach and liver cancers were identified (n = 269), and compared with a randomly selected group of non-māori patients (n = 255). clinical and outcome data were collected from medical records, and the administrative hospitalisation and mortality databases. logistic and cox regression modelling with multivariable adjustment were used to examine the impacts of",retrospective cohort stomach liver impact comorbidity ethnicity care outcome comorbidity adverse impact survival partly negative impact receipt curative comorbidity unevenly distribute within population ethnic socioeconomic group considerably high burden investigate inter relationship comorbidity ethnicity receipt survival among stomach liver new zealand method use new zealand registry ori diagnose stomach liver identify n compare randomly select group non ori n outcome data collect medical record administrative hospitalisation mortality database logistic cox regression model multivariable adjustment use examine impact,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer incidence in eastern Morocco: cancer patterns and incidence trends, 2005–2012 Cancer is one of the major health problems worldwide. In this article, we present for the first time the cancer incidence trends, the distribution and the socioeconomic profile of incident cancer cases in Eastern Morocco over a period of eight years. Retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with cancer at the Hassan II Regional Oncology Center (ROC) since it was created in October 2005 until December 2012. During the study period, the ROC was the only hospital specialized in cancer care in Eastern Morocco. A total of 7872 incident cases of cancer were registered in Eastern Morocco. Among these incident cases 5220 cases were women and 2652 were men, with a female to male ratio of 1.97. The mean age at diagnosis was 58 years for males and 52 for females and 94% of the patients aged over 30 years. For both sexes combined and for all cancer sites, breast cancer was the commonest followed by cervix uteri, colon-rectum, lung, nasopharynx, and stomach cancers. The most common cancer in women was breast cancer, followed respectively by cervix uteri cancer, colon-rectum cancer, ovary cancer, and stomach cancer. In men, the lung cancer ranked first, followed respectively by colon-rectum cancer, nasopharynx cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. For most cancers, crude incidence rates (CR) have increased significantly. The CR for all cancers combined has increased from 56.6 to 80.3 per 100,000 females and from 32.3 to 42.6 per 100,000 males during the study period. Patients profile analysis showed that 79% of cancer patients were from urban areas, 83% were unemployed and 85% had no health insurance. The distribution of cancers in Eastern Morocco is different from those observed in other regions of Morocco. Unlike most countries, women were much more affected with cancer than men in Eastern Morocco. More importantly, the rates of many cancers are rising. Therefore, our data justify the need to develop effective programs for cancer control and prevention in Eastern Morocco. A better access to cancer care should be a priority of the health policies, given that the majority of cancer patients in Eastern Morocco are unemployed, and do not have medical care coverage.","cancer incidence in eastern morocco: cancer patterns and incidence trends, 2005–2012 cancer is one of the major health problems worldwide. in this article, we present for the first time the cancer incidence trends, the distribution and the socioeconomic profile of incident cancer cases in eastern morocco over a period of eight years. retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with cancer at the hassan ii regional oncology center (roc) since it was created in october 2005 until december 2012. during the study period, the roc was the only hospital specialized in cancer care in eastern morocco. a total of 7872 incident cases of cancer were registered in eastern morocco. among these incident cases 5220 cases were women and 2652 were men, with a female to male ratio of 1.97. the mean age at diagnosis was 58 years for males and 52 for females and 94% of the patients aged over 30",incidence eastern morocco pattern incidence trend one major health problem worldwide article present first time incidence trend distribution socioeconomic profile incident eastern morocco period eight year retrospective descriptive diagnose hassan ii regional oncology center roc since create october december period roc hospital specialize care eastern morocco total incident register eastern morocco among incident woman men female male ratio mean age diagnosis year male female age,d,Stomach Cancer
"Distinctive gene expression of human lung adenocarcinomas carrying LKB1 mutations LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1.","distinctive gene expression of human lung adenocarcinomas carrying lkb1 mutations lkb1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the peutz-jeghers syndrome (pjs), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. regarding tumors arising in non-pjs patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (lads) harbor somatic lkb1 gene mutations, supporting a role for lkb1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. to characterize the pattern of lkb1 mutations in lads further, we first screened for lkb1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 lads and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. recent reports demonstrate that lkb1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the",distinctive gene expression human lung adenocarcinoma carry lkb mutation lkb suppressor gene codify serine threonine kinase mutate germ line affect peutz jeghers syndrome pjs increase incidence several include gastrointestinal pancreatic lung carcinoma regard arise non pjs recently observe least one third lung adenocarcinoma lads harbor somatic lkb gene mutation support role lkb origin sporadic characterize pattern lkb mutation lad far first screen lkb gene alteration gene mutation promoter hypermethylation homozygous deletion lad agreement previous data five show harbor mutation give rise truncate protein recent report demonstrate lkb able suppress cell growth little know,c,Lung Cancer
"Types and amount of dietary fat and colon cancer risk: Prevention by omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in the Western world including the United Sates. In recent years there is a strong upward trend in colon cancer risk in Japan mainly due to Americanization of Japanese food habits. Several epidemiological studies point to a strong association between nutrient composition of the diet and cancer of the colon. The role of types of dietary fat, especially saturated fats of animal origin, n−6- and n−3-rich polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the etiology of colorectal cancer has become increasingly apparent. Epidemiological studies indicate a positive association between the dietary intake of saturated fat and/or animal fat and colon cancer risk and an inverse relationship between the intake of fish and fish oil rich in n−3 PUFAs and colon cancer development. Although the evidence from case-control studies and international correlational studies is not totally consistent, these inconsistencies may have arisen, at least in part, from methodological limitations. Animal, model studies have unequivocally provided evidence that the colon tumor-promoting effect of dietary fat depends on its fatty acid composition and that high dietary n−3 PUFAs lacks colon tumor-promoting effect, as compared to diets high in n−6 PUFAs or saturated fats. Diets rich in n−3 PUFAs inhibit colon carcinogenesis through the modulation of colonicras-p21, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities and apoptosis. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays indicates that n−3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid activates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21, p27, p57 and p19 and inactivates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of genes, and prostagland in family of genes. These results suggest that decreasing the intake of n−6 PUFAs and saturated fats and increasing that of n−3 PUFAs, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid has the potential to be a major component of colon cancer control.","types and amount of dietary fat and colon cancer risk: prevention by omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in the western world including the united sates. in recent years there is a strong upward trend in colon cancer risk in japan mainly due to americanization of japanese food habits. several epidemiological studies point to a strong association between nutrient composition of the diet and cancer of the colon. the role of types of dietary fat, especially saturated fats of animal origin, n−6- and n−3-rich polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) in the etiology of colorectal cancer has become increasingly apparent. epidemiological studies indicate a positive association between the dietary intake of saturated fat and/or animal fat and colon cancer risk and an inverse relationship between the intake of fish and fish oil rich in n−3 pufas and colon cancer development. although the evidence from case-control studies",type amount dietary fat colon risk prevention omega fatty acid rich diet colorectal second common malignancy western world include united sates recent year strong upward trend colon risk japan mainly due americanization japanese food habit several epidemiological point strong association nutrient composition diet colon role type dietary fat especially saturate fat animal origin n n rich polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas etiology colorectal become increasingly apparent epidemiological indicate positive association dietary intake saturated fat animal fat colon risk inverse relationship intake fish fish oil rich n pufas colon development although evidence control,a,Colon Cancer
"Analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Fas/FasL in Japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer associated with HLA-A2. Abstract ; Purpose. In recent years, the use of immunotherapy for malignant tumors has been proposed. To explore the significance of immunotherapy for lung cancer, we examined two systems : the HLA class I and cancer-reactive CTL system, and the Fas-FasL system. ; Methods. HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) antigens were determined in 61 patients with lung cancer and in 30 healthy controls. The HLA class I phenotype was investigated by serological techniques. HLA-A2 alleles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer analysis. We analyzed lymphocytes isolated from 61 patients with two-color surface labeling and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we analyzed sFas and sFasL expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also examined lung cancer cell line-induced apoptosis of CD8+ lymphocytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy. ; Results. The HLA-A2 allele was observed in 27 of 61 patients with lung cancer. There were no differences in HLA-A2 allele classifications between lung cancer patients and controls. Thirty-six of the 61 lung cancer patients (57%) had elevated levels of sFas, and 16 of the 61 patients (26.2%) had elevated levels of sFasL. The sFas level of lung cancers with HLA-A2 was significantly higher than that of cancers without HLA-A2 (P<0.01). This tendency was observed in every lung cancer tissue type, and the sFas levels of lung cancers with HLA-A2 associated significantly with the CTL levels of lung cancers with HLA-A2. Furthermore, compared to lung cancers without HLA-A2, CD8+ T-cell levels were elevated in lung cancers with HLA-A2. In contrast, sFas levels of non-small cell lung cancers without HLA-A2 were higher than those in lung cancers with HLA-A2. In an in vitro experiment using lung cancer cell lines, we observed apoptosis of CD8+ lymphocytes induced by lung cancer cells. Lung cancer-reactive CTLs are mobilized easily by restriction of HLA-A2, but this restriction is not always specific. In addition, FasL derived from lung cancer cells can induce apoptosis of CD8+ T-cells, and the frequency of this phenomenon is increased in small cell lung cancers without HLA-A2. ; Conclusion. Our findings suggest that the effect of immunotherapy may be insufficient for non-small cell lung cancer without HLA-A2.","analysis of cytotoxic t lymphocytes and fas/fasl in japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer associated with hla-a2. abstract ; purpose. in recent years, the use of immunotherapy for malignant tumors has been proposed. to explore the significance of immunotherapy for lung cancer, we examined two systems : the hla class i and cancer-reactive ctl system, and the fas-fasl system. ; methods. hla class i (hla-a, -b, and -c) antigens were determined in 61 patients with lung cancer and in 30 healthy controls. the hla class i phenotype was investigated by serological techniques. hla-a2 alleles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer analysis. we analyzed lymphocytes isolated from 61 patients with two-color surface labeling and flow cytometry. furthermore, we analyzed sfas and sfasl expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). we also examined lung cancer cell line-induced apoptosis of cd8+ lymphocytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy. ; results. the hla-a2",cytotoxic lymphocyte fas fasl japanese non small cell lung associate hla abstract recent year use immunotherapy malignant propose explore significance immunotherapy lung examine two system hla class reactive ctl system fa fasl system method hla class hla b c antigen determine lung healthy control hla class phenotype investigate serological technique hla allele investigate polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primer analyze lymphocyte isolate two color surface labeling flow cytometry furthermore analyze sfas sfasl expression enzyme link immunosorbent assay elisa also examine lung cell line induce apoptosis cd lymphocyte use confocal laser scan microscopy result hla,c,Lung Cancer
"Estrogen receptor β is expressed in human stomach adenocarcinoma Purpose. In stomach adenocarcinoma, the role of the hormonal receptor, estrogen receptor (ER), has been controversial. Recently, a new estrogen receptor, called estrogen receptor β (ERβ), was found to be expressed in various tissues including normal gastrointestinal tract. In this paper, the expression of ERβ in stomach adenocarcinomas has been investigated for the first time, specifically in signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, together with surrounding non-cancerous tissues. Methods. By immunohistochemistry the expression of ERα and β was studied in 29 stomach adenocarcinomas, ten signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, and 19 other adenocarcinomas. Western blotting was performed to examine the immunohistochemical result. Statistical studies (Student's t test and χ2-test) explored the relation between the immunohistochemical result and clinicopathological characteristics. Results. All 29 adenocarcinomas, including the signet ring cell ones, demonstrated clear ERβ nucleus staining. Lymphocytes, venous endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and non-cancerous stomach glands also showed strong ERβ staining, while no staining was observed in the immunohistochemistry of ERα. Western blotting showed equivalent ERβ protein levels in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, which was consistent with the results of immunohistochemical staining. Among signet ring cell adenocarcinomas of the stomach, cytoplasm were stained in addition to nuclei, specifically in patients under the age of 40 years. Conclusions. Our results imply that the effects of estrogen in stomach cancer, as well as those in normal stomach, may be mediated by ERβ, and that the role of ERβ may differ by the subtype of stomach adenocarcinoma – specifically signet ring cell adenocarcinomas and other ones – although large scale samples are needed to confirm these findings.","estrogen receptor β is expressed in human stomach adenocarcinoma purpose. in stomach adenocarcinoma, the role of the hormonal receptor, estrogen receptor (er), has been controversial. recently, a new estrogen receptor, called estrogen receptor β (erβ), was found to be expressed in various tissues including normal gastrointestinal tract. in this paper, the expression of erβ in stomach adenocarcinomas has been investigated for the first time, specifically in signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, together with surrounding non-cancerous tissues. methods. by immunohistochemistry the expression of erα and β was studied in 29 stomach adenocarcinomas, ten signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, and 19 other adenocarcinomas. western blotting was performed to examine the immunohistochemical result. statistical studies (student's t test and χ2-test) explored the relation between the immunohistochemical result and clinicopathological characteristics. results. all 29 adenocarcinomas, including the signet ring cell ones, demonstrated clear erβ nucleus staining. lymphocytes, venous endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and non-cancerous stomach glands",estrogen receptor express human stomach adenocarcinoma stomach adenocarcinoma role hormonal receptor estrogen receptor er controversial recently new estrogen receptor call estrogen receptor er find express various tissue include normal gastrointestinal tract paper expression er stomach adenocarcinoma investigate first time specifically signet ring cell adenocarcinoma together surround non cancerous tissue method immunohistochemistry expression er stomach adenocarcinoma ten signet ring cell adenocarcinoma adenocarcinoma western blotting perform examine immunohistochemical result statistical student test test explore relation immunohistochemical result clinicopathological characteristic result adenocarcinomas include signet ring cell one demonstrate clear er nucleus stain lymphocyte venous endothelial cell smooth muscle non cancerous stomach gland,d,Stomach Cancer
"Reply to “Differences in the Impact of Age on Mortality in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer” To the editors: We read with great interest the recent publication by Yan et al. 1 highlighting the important prognostic differences between follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and the far more commonly encountered papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). FTC recurs rarely, but patients who have recurrences may die of metastatic disease in spite of otherwise favorable risk profiles. The different biology between the categories of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., PTC and FTC) is evident both clinically and in the laboratory. Furthermore, our group recently published a whole exome-sequencing analysis of FTC that mapped the genetic landscape of these tumors, with a particular emphasis on the infrequent widely invasive (WIFTC) subtype. 2 Of 10 WIFTC patients studied, 5 experienced recurrence and died of FTC within 10 years. Of 6 thyroid cancer-specific deaths in our overall FTC cohort of 39 cases, half were classified as stage I or II by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth-edition staging system, mostly due to the increased age cutoff of 55 years. 3 Interestingly, we found that both genomic markers and traditional clinical and histopathologic factors predicted poor survival. Unfortunately, the degree of FTC invasion is not wellcaptured in the national cancer registries, so a large-scale analysis of these high-risk subgroups is not possible using these approaches. Prior studies have demonstrated the prognostic significance of the degree of invasion for FTC in smaller single-institution series. 4 Although the AJCC eighth-edition staging system provides accurate prognostic information for the vast majority of patients with welldifferentiated thyroid cancer, certain high-risk histologic or molecular features may outweigh traditional tumor-nodemetastasis (TNM) staging and should be considered when the risk of recurrence and death is evaluated for thyroid cancer patients.","reply to “differences in the impact of age on mortality in well-differentiated thyroid cancer” to the editors: we read with great interest the recent publication by yan et al. 1 highlighting the important prognostic differences between follicular thyroid cancer (ftc) and the far more commonly encountered papillary thyroid cancer (ptc). ftc recurs rarely, but patients who have recurrences may die of metastatic disease in spite of otherwise favorable risk profiles. the different biology between the categories of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., ptc and ftc) is evident both clinically and in the laboratory. furthermore, our group recently published a whole exome-sequencing analysis of ftc that mapped the genetic landscape of these tumors, with a particular emphasis on the infrequent widely invasive (wiftc) subtype. 2 of 10 wiftc patients studied, 5 experienced recurrence and died of ftc within 10 years. of 6 thyroid cancer-specific deaths in our overall ftc cohort of 39",reply difference impact age mortality well differentiate thyroid editor read great interest recent publication yan et al highlight important prognostic difference follicular thyroid ftc far commonly encountered papillary thyroid ptc ftc recur rarely recurrence may die metastatic spite otherwise favorable risk profile different biology category well differentiate thyroid e ptc ftc evident clinically laboratory furthermore group recently publish whole exome sequence ftc map genetic landscape particular emphasis infrequent widely invasive wiftc subtype wiftc experienced recurrence die ftc within year thyroid specific death overall ftc cohort,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Heterogeneity of multiorgan metastases of human lung cancer cells genetically engineered to produce cytokines and reversal using chimeric monoclonal antibodies in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths, most of which can be attributed to distant multiorgan metastases. To examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis to distant organs, we have established novel models of human lung cancer (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer) metastasis in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We investigated whether local production of the cytokines responsible for regulation of macrophage function at tumor growth sites affects the pattern of lung cancer metastasis in distant organs. Several lung cancer cell lines were genetically engineered to produce human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and their metastatic potentials were assessed. Interestingly, M-CSF gene transduction had an antimetastatic effect for the liver and lymph nodes, but not the kidneys. In contrast, MCP-1 gene-modified lung cancer cells and their parent cells had identical metastatic potentials. These findings indicate a possible role for cyotokines and suggest that lung cancer has metastatic heterogeneity. Examining ways of controlling human lung cancer metastases, we investigated the antimetastatic effect of chimeric monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against P-glycoprotein and ganglioside GM2 (MH162 and KM966, respectively). Both MAbs, when given on days 2 and 7, inhibited the development of distant metastases of lung cancer in a dose-dependent fashion. Combined use of anti-P-glycoprotein MAb with M-CSF or MCP-1 gene transduction caused complete inhibition of metastasis of H69/VP cells. The antimetastatic effect of these MAbs in vivo was mainly due to an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reaction mediated by mouse macrophages. These findings suggest that the mouse-human chimeric MAb in combination with cytokine gene transduction may be useful for the eradication of lung cancer metastases in humans.","heterogeneity of multiorgan metastases of human lung cancer cells genetically engineered to produce cytokines and reversal using chimeric monoclonal antibodies in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths, most of which can be attributed to distant multiorgan metastases. to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis to distant organs, we have established novel models of human lung cancer (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer) metastasis in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice. we investigated whether local production of the cytokines responsible for regulation of macrophage function at tumor growth sites affects the pattern of lung cancer metastasis in distant organs. several lung cancer cell lines were genetically engineered to produce human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), and their metastatic potentials were assessed. interestingly, m-csf gene transduction had an antimetastatic effect for",heterogeneity multiorgan metastasis human lung cell genetically engineer produce cytokine reversal use chimeric monoclonal antibody natural killer cell deplete severe combine immunodeficient mouse lung major cause death attribute distant multiorgan metastasis examine cellular molecular mechanism lung metastasis distant organ establish novel model human lung small cell non small cell lung metastasis natural killer cell deplete severe combine immunodeficient scid mouse investigate whether local production cytokine responsible regulation macrophage function growth sit affect pattern lung metastasis distant organ several lung cell line genetically engineer produce human macrophage colony stimulate factor csf monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp metastatic potential assess interestingly csf gene transduction antimetastatic effect,c,Lung Cancer
"Increased lung cancer risks are similar whether arsenic is ingested or inhaled In 1980, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined there was sufficient evidence to support that inorganic arsenic was a human lung carcinogen based on studies involving exposure through inhalation. In 2004, IARC listed arsenic in drinking water as a cause of lung cancer, making arsenic the first substance established to cause human cancer through two unrelated pathways of exposure. It may initially seem counterintuitive that arsenic in drinking water would cause human lung cancer, and even if it did, one might expect risks to be orders of magnitude lower than those from direct inhalation into the lungs. In this paper, we consider lung cancer dose-response relationships for inhalation and ingestion of arsenic by focusing on two key studies, a cohort mortality study in the United States involving Tacoma smelter workers inhaling arsenic, and a lung cancer case-control study involving ingestion of arsenic in drinking water in northern Chile. When exposure was assessed based on the absorbed dose identified by concentrations of arsenic in urine, there was very little difference in the dose-response findings for lung cancer relative risks between inhalation and ingestion. The lung cancer mortality rate ratio estimate was 8.0 (95% CI 3.2-16.5, P<0.001) for an average urine concentration of 1179 microg/l after inhalation, and the odds ratio estimate of the lung cancer incidence rate ratio was 7.1 (95% CI 3.4-14.8, P<0.001) for an estimated average urine concentration of 825 microg/l following ingestion. The slopes of the linear dose-response relationships between excess relative risk (RR-1) for lung cancer and urinary arsenic concentration were similar for the two routes of exposure. We conclude that lung cancer risks probably depend on absorbed dose, and not on whether inorganic arsenic is ingested or inhaled.","increased lung cancer risks are similar whether arsenic is ingested or inhaled in 1980, the international agency for research on cancer (iarc) determined there was sufficient evidence to support that inorganic arsenic was a human lung carcinogen based on studies involving exposure through inhalation. in 2004, iarc listed arsenic in drinking water as a cause of lung cancer, making arsenic the first substance established to cause human cancer through two unrelated pathways of exposure. it may initially seem counterintuitive that arsenic in drinking water would cause human lung cancer, and even if it did, one might expect risks to be orders of magnitude lower than those from direct inhalation into the lungs. in this paper, we consider lung cancer dose-response relationships for inhalation and ingestion of arsenic by focusing on two key studies, a cohort mortality study in the united states involving tacoma smelter workers inhaling arsenic, and a lung",increase lung risk similar whether arsenic ingest inhale international agency research iarc determine sufficient evidence support inorganic arsenic human lung carcinogen base involve exposure inhalation iarc list arsenic drink water cause lung make arsenic first substance establish cause human two unrelated pathway exposure may initially seem counterintuitive arsenic drinking water would cause human lung even one might expect risk order magnitude low direct inhalation lung paper consider lung dose response relationship inhalation ingestion arsenic focus two key cohort mortality united state involve tacoma smelter worker inhale arsenic lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Current lung cancer screening guidelines may miss high-risk population: a real-world study. Despite much research published on lung cancer screening, China has had no large-scale study on the missed diagnosis of lung cancer in a health examination population. We therefore did a real-world study using the current lung cancer screening guidelines to a health examination population in China to determine the proportion of lung cancer cases that have been missed. A real-world cohort study of screening, with the use of low-dose computed tomography, was conducted among people who took yearly health checkup in health management center of West China Hospital between 2006 and 2017. We respectively used current guidelines including lung cancer screening guidelines of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and expert consensus on low dose spiral CT lung cancer screening in China. In a total of 15,996 participants with health examination who completed the baseline screening, 6779 (42.4%) subjects had at least one positive finding, and 142 (2.1%) cases of lung cancer were screened positive. The false positive rate was 97.9%. Of 142 lung cancer cases detected in our study, only 9.2% met the lung cancer screening guidelines proposed by the USPSTF, and 24.4% met that of China. The rates of missed diagnosis were as high as 90.8 and 75.6% respectively. In addition, we did an in-depth analysis by gender. We found that among male patients with lung cancer, the proportion of smokers was 75%, and the proportion of young people under 50 was 23.2%. Among female patients with lung cancer, the proportion of smokers was only 5.8%, and the proportion of young people under 50 was up to 33.3%.

"Trends in oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancer mortality rates in Spain, 1952–2006: an age-period-cohort analysis Although oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancers share some risk factors, no comparative analysis of mortality rate trends in these illnesses has been undertaken in Spain. This study aimed to evaluate the independent effects of age, death period and birth cohort on the mortality rates of these tumours. Specific and age-adjusted mortality rates by tumour and sex were analysed. Age-period-cohort log-linear models were fitted separately for each tumour and sex, and segmented regression models were used to detect changes in period- and cohort-effect curvatures. Among men, the period-effect curvatures for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers displayed a mortality trend that rose until 1995 and then declined. Among women, oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality increased throughout the study period whereas oesophageal cancer mortality decreased after 1970. Stomach cancer mortality decreased in both sexes from 1965 onwards. Lastly, the cohort-effect curvature showed a certain degree of similarity for all three tumours in both sexes, which was greater among oral cavity, pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers, with a change point in evidence, after which risk of death increased in cohorts born from the 1910-1920s onwards and decreased among the 1950–1960 cohorts and successive generations. This latter feature was likewise observed for stomach cancer. While the similarities of the cohort effects in oral cavity/pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric tumours support the implication of shared risk factors, the more marked changes in cohort-effect curvature for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancer could be due to the greater influence of some risk factors in their aetiology, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. The increase in oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality in women deserves further study.","trends in oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancer mortality rates in spain, 1952–2006: an age-period-cohort analysis although oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancers share some risk factors, no comparative analysis of mortality rate trends in these illnesses has been undertaken in spain. this study aimed to evaluate the independent effects of age, death period and birth cohort on the mortality rates of these tumours. specific and age-adjusted mortality rates by tumour and sex were analysed. age-period-cohort log-linear models were fitted separately for each tumour and sex, and segmented regression models were used to detect changes in period- and cohort-effect curvatures. among men, the period-effect curvatures for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers displayed a mortality trend that rose until 1995 and then declined. among women, oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality increased throughout the study period whereas oesophageal cancer mortality decreased after 1970. stomach cancer mortality decreased in both sexes from",trend oral cavity pharyngeal oesophageal gastric mortality rate spain age period cohort although oral cavity pharyngeal oesophageal gastric share risk factor comparative mortality rate trend illness undertake spain evaluate independent effect age death period birth cohort mortality rate specific age adjust mortality rate sex analysed age period cohort log linear model fit separately sex segmented regression model use detect change period cohort effect curvatures among men period effect curvature oral cavity pharyngeal oesophageal display mortality trend rise decline among woman oral cavity pharyngeal mortality increase throughout period whereas oesophageal mortality decrease stomach mortality decrease sex,d,Stomach Cancer

"Gradual tube dilation method before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for obstructive esophageal cancer In patients with obstructive esophageal cancer (OEC) with stenosis of the tract to the stomach, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure cannot be performed if the endoscope is unable to pass through to the stomach. Our aim was to describe the safety and utility of the gradual tube dilation method (GTD) before PEG in cases of OEC. This study enrolled 38 consecutive patients. If an ultrathin transnasal endoscope (UTNE) could successfully reach the stomach through the esophageal stenosis, then PEG was performed without using the GTD. If even the UTNE could not be passed to the stomach, PEG was performed after the GTD. The GTD shows the method that gradually increases the size from an 8 Fr to 16 Fr nasogastric tube which passed through the obstruction before performing PEG. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who received the GTD. The complications were examined from the first UTNE to the completion of PEG. Seventeen of 38 patients received the GTD. All 17 patients successfully underwent the PEG procedures. The intubation period was 9.8 ± 3.4 days. The mean number of replacements was 2.5. Regarding complications, only three of the 17 patients experienced a sore throat. No significant differences were found in the PEG procedure times between the patients with the GTD and those without the GTD (P = 0.360). If patients with progressive esophageal cancer, such as OEC, need to undergo PEG, then the GTD is considered to be a useful modality for dilating the stenosis simply and safely.","gradual tube dilation method before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for obstructive esophageal cancer in patients with obstructive esophageal cancer (oec) with stenosis of the tract to the stomach, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) procedure cannot be performed if the endoscope is unable to pass through to the stomach. our aim was to describe the safety and utility of the gradual tube dilation method (gtd) before peg in cases of oec. this study enrolled 38 consecutive patients. if an ultrathin transnasal endoscope (utne) could successfully reach the stomach through the esophageal stenosis, then peg was performed without using the gtd. if even the utne could not be passed to the stomach, peg was performed after the gtd. the gtd shows the method that gradually increases the size from an 8 fr to 16 fr nasogastric tube which passed through the obstruction before performing peg. we conducted a retrospective review of all patients",gradual tube dilation method percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy obstructive esophageal obstructive esophageal oec stenosis tract stomach percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy peg procedure cannot perform endoscope unable pass stomach describe safety utility gradual tube dilation method gtd peg oec enrol consecutive ultrathin transnasal endoscope utne could successfully reach stomach esophageal stenosis peg perform without use gtd even utne could pass stomach peg perform gtd gtd show method gradually increase size fr fr nasogastric tube pass obstruction perform peg conduct retrospective review,d,Stomach Cancer
"Incidence and histological patterns of thyroid cancer in Sri Lanka 2001-2010: an analysis of national cancer registry data. An increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is observed in many developed countries. Increasing incidence may also reflect better reporting or increased diagnostic scrutiny. We conducted this study to examine trends in thyroid cancer incidence and histological patterns in Sri Lanka. A retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer during 2001–2010 was performed using population based data published from the Sri Lanka National Cancer Registry. Trends in incidence and histological patterns were analysed by age and gender. The age-standardized incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 2.44 per 100,000 in 2001 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.21–2.67) to 5.16 per 100,000 in 2010 (95% CI: 4.85–5.47); a 2.1-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). A greater part of this increase is attributable to increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancer, which increased from 1.64 to 3.61 per 100,000; a 2.2-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). Follicular cancer showed lesser, yet a significant increase from 0.56 to 0.95 per 100,000 (p < 0.05). Other varieties of thyroid cancer showed no significant increases in incidence. Trends in the increases in incidence of papillary cancer in females showed a much greater increase compared with males (from 2.45 to 5.60 per 100,000, a 2.28-fold increase in females compared with from 0.82 to 1.55; a 1.89-fold increase in males, p < 0.001). Highest incidence of papillary cancer was observed in 30–39-year age group, which has increased from 5.56 to 12.9 per 100,000; a 2.32-fold increase (p < 0.001). The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in Sri Lanka is predominantly due to the increasing incidence of papillary cancers. These trends may reflect increased detection and better reporting, although an inherent increase in the incidence is the likely main contributor. Further studies including tumour stage and mortality may help answer these questions.","incidence and histological patterns of thyroid cancer in sri lanka 2001-2010: an analysis of national cancer registry data. an increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is observed in many developed countries. increasing incidence may also reflect better reporting or increased diagnostic scrutiny. we conducted this study to examine trends in thyroid cancer incidence and histological patterns in sri lanka. a retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer during 2001–2010 was performed using population based data published from the sri lanka national cancer registry. trends in incidence and histological patterns were analysed by age and gender. the age-standardized incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 2.44 per 100,000 in 2001 (95% confidence interval [95% ci]: 2.21–2.67) to 5.16 per 100,000 in 2010 (95% ci: 4.85–5.47); a 2.1-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). a greater part of this increase is attributable to increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancer, which increased from",incidence histological pattern thyroid sri lanka national registry data increase incidence thyroid observe many developed country increase incidence may also reflect good reporting increase diagnostic scrutiny conduct examine trend thyroid incidence histological pattern sri lanka retrospective cohort evaluation thyroid perform use population base data publish sri lanka national registry trend incidence histological pattern analyse age gender age standardize incidence thyroid increase per confidence interval ci per ci fold increase p trend great part increase attributable increase incidence papillary thyroid increase,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Molecular detection of circulating thyroid specific transcripts (TSHR/Tg-mRNAs) in thyroid cancer patients: Their diagnostic significance Abstract Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. The preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that relies solely on fine-needle aspiration (FNAC) biopsy, sometimes possesses conflicting results. New molecular markers for thyroid cancer have been investigated with most of them based on the detection in thyroid nodules or tumor tissue specimens. Recently, it was possible to detect thyroid cancer cells in the circulation by measuring the mRNA of thyroid specific genes. Among these, thyroglobulin and more recently thyroid stimulating hormone receptor mRNAs, TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood might serve as cancer-specific markers. These have become promising new circulating markers for thyroid cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess TSHR/Tg-mRNAs as diagnostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer and if they can be used preoperatively in synergy with FNAC. This study was performed on 60 subjects; 20 healthy volunteers and 40 patients; including 16 patients with benign thyroid diseases, 24 patients with thyroid cancer; 18 patients with newly diagnosed (DTC) and 6 patients with recurrent thyroid cancer. Diagnosis of cancer was based on FNAC and histopathology of surgical specimens. All subjects had TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood measured by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Based on cytology/pathology; 18 patients had newly diagnosed DTC and 11 had benign thyroid disease. Preoperative FNAC was performed on 29 of 40 patients; FNAC was diagnostic in 11/18 of malignant lesions (61.1%), in 8/11 of benign lesions (72.7%), while 10/29 (34.5%) were indeterminate. TSHR/Tg-mRNAs correctly diagnosed DTC in 20/24 and 19/24 (sensitivity 83.3% and 79.1%) and benign disease in 14/16 and 13/16 (specificity 87.5% and 81.3%), respectively. With indeterminate FNA, TSHR/Tg-mRNAs correctly diagnosed DTC (follicular type) in 5/7 and benign disease in 2/3 (combined sensitivity 71.4%; specificity 66.7%). There was high concordance between RT-PCR results for TSHR-mRNA and Tg-mRNA. Of the controls 19/20 (95%) and 16/20 (80%) were negative for both TSHR- and Tg-mRNAs. With the use of a carefully selected primer pair and qualitative RT-PCR; our results indicate that TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood are both equally sensitive and specific markers for detection of thyroid cancer cells. Combining TSHR/Tg-mRNAs and FNAC and ultrasound enhances the preoperative detection of cancer in patients with thyroid nodules, reducing unnecessary surgeries and correctly classified most follicular cancers and could have spared surgery in patients with benign disease.","molecular detection of circulating thyroid specific transcripts (tshr/tg-mrnas) in thyroid cancer patients: their diagnostic significance abstract thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. the preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) that relies solely on fine-needle aspiration (fnac) biopsy, sometimes possesses conflicting results. new molecular markers for thyroid cancer have been investigated with most of them based on the detection in thyroid nodules or tumor tissue specimens. recently, it was possible to detect thyroid cancer cells in the circulation by measuring the mrna of thyroid specific genes. among these, thyroglobulin and more recently thyroid stimulating hormone receptor mrnas, tshr/tg-mrnas in peripheral blood might serve as cancer-specific markers. these have become promising new circulating markers for thyroid cancer. the purpose of this study is to assess tshr/tg-mrnas as diagnostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer and if they can be used preoperatively in synergy with fnac. this study was performed on",molecular detection circulate thyroid specific transcript tshr tg mrna thyroid diagnostic significance abstract thyroid prevalent endocrine malignancy preoperative diagnosis differentiated thyroid dtc rely solely fine needle aspiration fnac biopsy sometimes possess conflict result new molecular marker thyroid investigate base detection thyroid nodule tissue specimens recently possible detect thyroid cell circulation measure mrna thyroid specific gene among thyroglobulin recently thyroid stimulate hormone receptor mrna tshr tg mrna peripheral blood might serve specific marker become promising new circulate marker thyroid assess tshr tg mrna diagnostic molecular marker thyroid use preoperatively synergy fnac perform,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Isothiocyanates induce oxidative stress and suppress the metastasis potential of human non-small cell lung cancer cells Isothiocyanates are natural compounds found in consumable cruciferous vegetables. They have been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis by a wide variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models. Recent studies have also shown that isothiocyanates have antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of several types of cultured human cancer cells. Our previous study showed that PEITC inhibited human leukemia cells growth by inducing apoptosis. However, the effect of isothiocyanates on lung cancer cell metastasis has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of BITC and PEITC on metastatic potential of highly metastatic human lung cancer L9981 cells. Cell migration and invasion were measured by wound healing assay and transwell chemotaxis assay. Expression of metastasis-related genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The mechanisms of action were evaluated by flow cytometry, reporter assay and Western blotting. Our data showed that both BITC and PEITC inhibited L9981 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 values were 5.0 and 9.7 μM, respectively. Cell migrations were reduced to 8.1% and 16.5% of control, respectively; and cell invasions were reduced to 2.7% and 7.3% of control, respectively. Metastasis-related genes MMP-2, Twist and β-catenin were also modulated. BITC and PEITC inhibited cell survival signaling molecules Akt and NFκB activation. Moreover, BITC and PEITC increased ROS generation and caused GSH depletion. Pretreatment with NAC blocked BITC and PEITC induced ROS elevation and NFκB inhibition. Our results indicated that BITC and PEITC suppress lung cancer cell metastasis potential by modulation of metastasis-related gene expression, inhibition of Akt/NFκB pathway. Induction of oxidative stress may play an important role.","isothiocyanates induce oxidative stress and suppress the metastasis potential of human non-small cell lung cancer cells isothiocyanates are natural compounds found in consumable cruciferous vegetables. they have been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis by a wide variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models. recent studies have also shown that isothiocyanates have antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of several types of cultured human cancer cells. our previous study showed that peitc inhibited human leukemia cells growth by inducing apoptosis. however, the effect of isothiocyanates on lung cancer cell metastasis has not been studied. in the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of bitc and peitc on metastatic potential of highly metastatic human lung cancer l9981 cells. cell migration and invasion were measured by wound healing assay and transwell chemotaxis assay. expression of metastasis-related genes was assessed by quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting. the mechanisms of action were evaluated by flow",isothiocyanate induce oxidative stress suppress metastasis potential human non small cell lung cell isothiocyanate natural compound find consumable cruciferous vegetable show inhibit chemical carcinogenesis wide variety chemical carcinogen animal model recent also show isothiocyanate antitumor activity inhibit growth several type cultured human cell previous show peitc inhibit human leukemia cell growth induce apoptosis however effect isothiocyanate lung cell metastasis present investigate inhibitory effect bitc peitc metastatic potential highly metastatic human lung l cell cell migration invasion measure wound heal assay transwell chemotaxis assay expression metastasis relate gene assess quantitative rt pcr western blot mechanism action evaluate flow,c,Lung Cancer
"IDEAL-IQ in an oncologic population: meeting the challenge of concomitant liver fat and liver iron. Cancer patients often have a history of chemotherapy, putting them at increased risk of liver toxicity and pancytopenia, leading to elevated liver fat and elevated liver iron respectively. T1-in-and-out-of-phase, the conventional MR technique for liver fat assessment, fails to detect elevated liver fat in the presence of concomitantly elevated liver iron. IDEAL-IQ is a more recently introduced MR fat quantification method that corrects for multiple confounding factors, including elevated liver iron. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with a waiver for informed consent. We reviewed the MRI studies of 50 cancer patients (30 males, 20 females, 50–78 years old) whose exams included (1) T1-in-and-out-of-phase, (2) IDEAL-IQ, and (3) T2* mapping. Two readers independently assessed fat and iron content from conventional and IDEAL-IQ MR methods. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated to evaluate agreement between conventional MRI and IDEAL-IQ in measuring R2* level (a surrogate for iron level), and in measuring fat level. Agreement between the two readers was also assessed. Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed to compare iron level and fat fraction between conventional MRI and IDEAL-IQ. Twenty percent of patients had both elevated liver iron and moderate/severe hepatic steatosis. Across all patients, there was high agreement between readers for IDEAL-IQ fat fraction (ICC = 0.957) and IDEAL R2* (ICC = 0.971) measurements, but lower agreement for conventional fat fraction measurements (ICC = 0.626). The fat fractions calculated with IOP were statistically significantly different from those calculated with IDEAL-IQ (reader 1: p < 0.001, reader 2: p < 0.001). Fat measurements using IDEAL-IQ and IOP diverged in patients with concomitantly elevated liver fat and liver iron. Given prior work validating IDEAL-IQ, these diverging measurements indicate that IOP is inadequate to screen for hepatic steatosis in our cancer population.","ideal-iq in an oncologic population: meeting the challenge of concomitant liver fat and liver iron. cancer patients often have a history of chemotherapy, putting them at increased risk of liver toxicity and pancytopenia, leading to elevated liver fat and elevated liver iron respectively. t1-in-and-out-of-phase, the conventional mr technique for liver fat assessment, fails to detect elevated liver fat in the presence of concomitantly elevated liver iron. ideal-iq is a more recently introduced mr fat quantification method that corrects for multiple confounding factors, including elevated liver iron. this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with a waiver for informed consent. we reviewed the mri studies of 50 cancer patients (30 males, 20 females, 50–78 years old) whose exams included (1) t1-in-and-out-of-phase, (2) ideal-iq, and (3) t2* mapping. two readers independently assessed fat and iron content from conventional and ideal-iq mr methods. intraclass correlation coefficient (icc) was estimated to",ideal iq oncologic population meet challenge concomitant liver fat liver iron often history chemotherapy put increase risk liver toxicity pancytopenia lead elevate liver fat elevate liver iron respectively phase conventional mr technique liver fat assessment fail detect elevate liver fat presence concomitantly elevate liver iron ideal iq recently introduce mr fat quantification method correct multiple confound factor include elevate liver iron retrospective approve institutional review board waiver informed consent review mri males female year old whose exam include phase ideal iq mapping two reader independently assess fat iron content conventional ideal iq mr method intraclass correlation coefficient icc estimate,b,Liver Cancer

"Consumption of red meat and processed meat and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. Red meat and processed meat consumption has been hypothesized to increase risk of cancer, but the evidence is inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to summarize the evidence of associations between consumption of red meat (unprocessed), processed meat, and total red and processed meat with the incidence of various cancer types. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through December 2020. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the highest versus the lowest category of red meat, processed meat, and total red and processed meat consumption in relation to incidence of various cancers. We identified 148 published articles. Red meat consumption was significantly associated with greater risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03–1.15), endometrial cancer (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01-1.56), colorectal cancer (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03–1.17), colon cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.09-1.25), rectal cancer (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46), lung cancer (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.09–1.44), and hepatocellular carcinoma (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46).

"Thoracic stomach syndrome after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer mimicking tension pneumothorax: a case report Sudden onset of respiratory failure is one of the most fearful manifestations in intensive care units. Among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. However, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. A 49-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. Despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Hence, an aspiration catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. However, her clinical symptoms did not improve. Chest computed tomography was performed, which revealed a significantly distended reconstructed stomach that was compressing the nearby lung parenchyma. Her respiration improved immediately after nasogastric tube placement. After the procedure, we successfully extubated the patient. Similar to tension pneumothorax, thoracic stomach syndrome requires immediate drainage of air from the thoracic cavity. However, unlike tension pneumothorax, this condition requires nasogastric tube insertion, which is the only way to safely remove the accumulated air and avoid possible complications that could occur due to percutaneous drainage. For patient safety, it might be clinically important to place nasogastric tubes after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction, even if radiographic guidance is required. In addition, clinicians should consider thoracic stomach syndrome as one of the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure after whole-stomach esophagectomy.","thoracic stomach syndrome after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer mimicking tension pneumothorax: a case report sudden onset of respiratory failure is one of the most fearful manifestations in intensive care units. among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. however, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. we report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. a 49-year-old asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive",thoracic stomach syndrome whole stomach esophagectomy esophageal mimic tension pneumothorax report sudden onset respiratory failure one fearful manifestation intensive care unit among differential diagnosis respiratory failure tension pneumothorax life threaten require immediate invasive intervention drain air thoracic cavity however etiology manifestation similar tension pneumothorax also consider whole stomach esophagectomy esophageal report rare thoracic stomach syndrome mimic tension pneumothorax esophagectomy whole stomach reconstruction year old asian woman admit intensive care unit esophagectomy esophageal whole stomach reconstruction sedation intubated despite initial stable vital sign rapidly develop tachypnea low blood pressure low oxygen saturation chest radiography reveal mediastinal shift lead presumptive,d,Stomach Cancer
"Thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment: a cross- sectional study at a thyroid cancer referral center in Ecuador. In contrast to the rapid increase in thyroid cancer incidence, the mortality has remained low and stable over the last decades. In Ecuador, however, thyroid cancer mortality has increased. The objective of this study is to determine possible drivers of high rates of thyroid cancer mortality, through a cross-sectional analysis of all patients attending a thyroid cancer referral center in Ecuador. From June 2014 to December 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital de Especialidades Eugenio Espejo, a regional reference public hospital for endocrine neoplasia in adults in Quito, Ecuador. We identified the mechanism of detection, histopathology and treatment modalities from a patient interview and review of clinical records. Among 452 patients, 74.8% were young adults and 94.2% (426) were female. 13.7% had a family history of thyroid cancer, and patients’ median tumor size was 2 cm. The incidental finding was 54.2% whereas 45.8% was non-incidental. Thyroid cancer histology reported that 93.3% had papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 2.7% follicular, 1.5% Hurtle cells, 1.6% medullary, 0.7% poor differentiated, and 0.2% anaplastic carcinoma. The mean MACIS (metastasis, age, completeness, invasion, and size) score was 4.95 (CI 4.15–5.95) with 76.2% of the thyroid cancer patients having MACIS score less than or equal to 6. The very low and low risk of recurrence was 18.1% (79) and 62% (271) respectively. An analysis of 319 patients with non-metastatic thyroid cancer showed that 10.7% (34) of patients had surgical complications. Moreover, around 62.5% (80 from 128 patients with thyroglobulin laboratory results) of TC patients had a stimulated-thyroglobulin value equal or higher than 2 ng/ml. Overall, a poor surgical outcome was present in 35.1% (112) patients. Out of 436 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 86% (375) received radioactive iodine. Thyroid cancer histological characteristics and method of diagnosis are like those described in other reports without any evidence of the high frequency of aggressive thyroid cancer histology. However, we observed evidence of overtreatment and poor surgical outcomes that demand additional studies to understand their association with thyroid cancer mortality in Ecuador.","thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment: a cross- sectional study at a thyroid cancer referral center in ecuador. in contrast to the rapid increase in thyroid cancer incidence, the mortality has remained low and stable over the last decades. in ecuador, however, thyroid cancer mortality has increased. the objective of this study is to determine possible drivers of high rates of thyroid cancer mortality, through a cross-sectional analysis of all patients attending a thyroid cancer referral center in ecuador. from june 2014 to december 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the hospital de especialidades eugenio espejo, a regional reference public hospital for endocrine neoplasia in adults in quito, ecuador. we identified the mechanism of detection, histopathology and treatment modalities from a patient interview and review of clinical records. among 452 patients, 74.8% were young adults and 94.2% (426) were female. 13.7% had a family history of thyroid cancer, and patients’",thyroid overdiagnosis overtreatment cross sectional thyroid referral center ecuador contrast rapid increase thyroid incidence mortality remain low stable last decade ecuador however thyroid mortality increase determine possible driver high rate thyroid mortality cross sectional attend thyroid referral center ecuador june december cross sectional conduct hospital de especialidades eugenio espejo regional reference public hospital endocrine neoplasia adult quito ecuador identify mechanism detection histopathology modality interview review record among young adult female family history thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"A resected case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach with unusual lymph node metastasis Gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is a relatively rare tumor. We experienced a case of early gastric cancer in which an endocrine cell carcinoma was identified within a differentiated adenocarcinoma, and a component of this endocrine cell carcinoma had metastasized to lymph nodes of the stomach. In its 2010 revision regarding digestive system tumors, WHO classified cancer cells with characteristics of both glandular system cells and neuroendocrine cells as mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) under the neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) category. In this case, we observed an endocrine cell carcinoma continuous with an intramucosal differentiated adenocarcinoma, and cancer cells with an irregular gland duct structure were observed in the proliferative portion of the submucosal tissue. In addition, there was a 35 mm size lymph node metastasis in the lesser curvature of the stomach consisting entirely of poorly differentiated cancer cells with polymorphic, highly atypical nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistological analysis showed that the endocrine carcinoma in the gastric mucosa was chromogranin A positive and the infiltrated area of the submucosal tissue was also chromogranin A positive. The lymph node metastasis was positive not only for chromogranin A, but also for Synaptophysin and CD56. Furthermore, the Ki67 labeling index was high at approximately 80 % for the gastric endocrine cell carcinoma and approximately 90 % for the lymph node metastases. Until now, there are no reports related to the patients with early gastric cancer accompanied with lymph node metastasis of MANEC. This case is very interested in considering the mechanism of lymph node metastasis of MANEC. The patient has shown no sign of recurrence for 1 year and 4 months after postoperative chemotherapy.","a resected case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach with unusual lymph node metastasis gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is a relatively rare tumor. we experienced a case of early gastric cancer in which an endocrine cell carcinoma was identified within a differentiated adenocarcinoma, and a component of this endocrine cell carcinoma had metastasized to lymph nodes of the stomach. in its 2010 revision regarding digestive system tumors, who classified cancer cells with characteristics of both glandular system cells and neuroendocrine cells as mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma (manec) under the neuroendocrine carcinoma (nec) category. in this case, we observed an endocrine cell carcinoma continuous with an intramucosal differentiated adenocarcinoma, and cancer cells with an irregular gland duct structure were observed in the proliferative portion of the submucosal tissue. in addition, there was a 35 mm size lymph node metastasis in the lesser curvature of the stomach consisting entirely of poorly differentiated",resected neuroendocrine carcinoma stomach unusual lymph node metastasis gastric endocrine cell carcinoma relatively rare experience early gastric endocrine cell carcinoma identify within differentiated adenocarcinoma component endocrine cell carcinoma metastasize lymph node stomach revision regard digestive system classify cell characteristic glandular system cell neuroendocrine cell mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma manec neuroendocrine carcinoma nec category observe endocrine cell carcinoma continuous intramucosal differentiate adenocarcinoma cell irregular gland duct structure observe proliferative portion submucosal tissue addition mm size lymph node metastasis less curvature stomach consist entirely poorly differentiate,d,Stomach Cancer
"Comment on Kasai et al.: Clinical profile of long-term survivors of breast or thyroid cancer with metastatic spinal tumours Dear Editor,; ; We read with great interest the paper by Kasai et al. [4] published in International Orthopaedics. We congratulate the authors on their work. We agree with them on one point and disagree on another one. The first is that a long time (above 5 years) between diagnosis of the thyroid cancer and the operation for the spinal metastases would be a good prognostic sign. However, we disagree that the “surgical strategy for spinal metastases” developed by us [5] would not expect survival in patients with spinal metastases from thyroid cancer.; ; In 2002, we reviewed 14 cases of thyroid cancer spinal metastases treated between December 1984 and July 2000 in the Orthopedic Department, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan. The patients included 9 females and 5 males. The primary tumor was follicular carcinoma in 10 and papillary carcinoma in 4. Four patients (28.6%) had presented with spinal metastases without a history of thyroid cancer and one patients presented with spinal metastases 14 years after excision of a thyroid lesion diagnosed as follicular adenoma. The remaining 9 patients developed their spinal metastases after a mean of 8.2 years from diagnosis of thyroid cancer (range 0.25–22 years). In total, those 14 patients received 25 operations [1]. When we applied the criteria suggested by Kasai et al. [4] on our patients, we found that five patients had their spinal metastases 5 years or more after diagnosis of thyroid cancer primary tumour; four out of those five patients (80%) survived for more than 5 years (mean 98.5, range 78–124 months). The fifth patient died 33 months after the operative intervention for the spinal metastases [1]. So, we completely agree with Kasai et al. [4] that a long time span (above 5 years) between diagnosis of the thyroid cancer and the operation for the spinal metastases would be a good prognostic sign with about 80% of the patients surviving for more than 5 years. However, we disagree with the conclusion regarding the invalidity of the surgical strategy for spinal metastases in survival predilection in cases of thyroid cancer. We reviewed the validity of the surgical strategy for spinal metastases in the same 14 cases of thyroid cancer spinal metastases. The strategy scores were detected for the 25 operations, whether performed before or after development of the strategy. Postoperative survival was detected and compared between different scores. Total scores after strategy application were 2 (7 operations; 28%), 3 (11 operations; 44%), 4 (2 operations, 8%) and 5 (5 operations, 20%). No patient had scores from 6–10 at the time of any operation. Survival after operations with scores 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 75.6 ± 25.8, 32.6 ± 27.8, 23 and 18.4 ± 9.8 months, respectively. Survival correlates with the score with correlation coefficient equals -0.68 (P = 0.005). Survival with scores of 2 and 3 after operation (candidates of long-term local control) was 51.4 ± 34.1 months while survival after operations for patients having the scores of 4 and 5 (candidates of middle-term local control) was 19.7 ± 10.5 months. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04) [2, 3]. From these results, we can conclude that the surgical strategy for spinal metastases would successfully predict survival in patients with thyroid cancer spinal metastases.","comment on kasai et al.: clinical profile of long-term survivors of breast or thyroid cancer with metastatic spinal tumours dear editor,; ; we read with great interest the paper by kasai et al.

"The role of CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE in monitoring tumor response to Nivolumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE are tumor markers used for monitoring the response to chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer, respectively. Their role in cancer immunotherapy needs to be elucidated. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks within the Italian Nivolumab Expanded Access Program. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each cycle up to cycle 5 and then every two cycles until patient’s withdrawn from the study. All patients underwent a CT-scan after every 4 cycles of treatment and responses were classified according to RECIST 1.1. The biomarkers serum levels were measured with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for CEA and with an immuno radiometric assay for CYFRA21-1 and NSE. The markers values at baseline and after 4 cycles were used to analyze the relationship between their variation over baseline and the tumor response, evaluated as disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD), and survival (PFS and OS). A total of 70 patients were evaluable for the analysis. Overall, a disease control was obtained in 24 patients (35.8%, 4 PR + 20 SD). After 4 cycles of nivolumab a CEA or CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% over the baseline was significantly associated with DCR (CEA, p = 0.021; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001), PFS (CEA, p = 0.028; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001) and OS (CEA, p = 0.026; CYFRA21-1, p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis confirmed the ability of CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% to predict DCR (p = 0.002) and PFS (p < 0.001).

"Risk of Advanced Proximal Adenoma and Cancer According to Rectosigmoid Findings in the Korean Population Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the United States and Europe. Recently, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing remarkably in Korea. To reduce the high incidence, screening of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic individuals has been advocated. Sigmoidoscopy is simpler, faster, and better tolerable than total colonoscopy, but the scope cannot reach the proximal colon segment and, therefore, may miss proximal colon cancer. In the present study, we intended to investigate the prevalence of proximal adenoma and cancer according to the findings in rectosigmoid colon and to find their risk factors. Data were collected retrospectively from 1541 consecutive patients who underwent total colonoscopy at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hanyang University, between October 2003 and December 2004. Neoplasms were classified as diminutive adenoma ( or =10 mm, with villous component or high-grade dysplasia), and cancer. The sites of neoplasms were defined as rectosigmoid (rectum and sigmoid colon) and proximal (from cecum to descending colon) colon. The prevalence of advanced proximal adenoma was associated with severe rectosigmoid findings. On the other hand, the prevalence of proximal colon cancer did not show such a tendency. Among the 131 patients with proximal advanced adenoma, 66% had no neoplasm in the rectosigmoid colon. Moreover, among the 27 patients with proximal cancer, 52% had no neoplasm in the rectosigmoid colon. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, gender, and advanced rectosigmoid adenoma were the risk factors of advanced proximal adenoma, but nothing was associated with the risk for proximal colon cancer. Advanced rectosigmoid adenoma may be the predictor of advanced proximal adenoma, especially in old males. However, nothing is related to the risk for proximal colon cancer. Therefore, colonoscopy may be more adequate for colorectal cancer screening than sigmoidoscopy in the Korean population.","risk of advanced proximal adenoma and cancer according to rectosigmoid findings in the korean population colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the united states and europe. recently, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing remarkably in korea. to reduce the high incidence, screening of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic individuals has been advocated. sigmoidoscopy is simpler, faster, and better tolerable than total colonoscopy, but the scope cannot reach the proximal colon segment and, therefore, may miss proximal colon cancer. in the present study, we intended to investigate the prevalence of proximal adenoma and cancer according to the findings in rectosigmoid colon and to find their risk factors. data were collected retrospectively from 1541 consecutive patients who underwent total colonoscopy at the department of gastroenterology, hanyang university, between october 2003 and december 2004. neoplasms were classified as diminutive adenoma ( or =10 mm, with villous",risk advanced proximal adenoma accord rectosigmoid finding korean population colorectal one leading cause death united state europe recently incidence colorectal increase remarkably korea reduce high incidence screening colorectal asymptomatic individual advocate sigmoidoscopy simple faster well tolerable total colonoscopy scope cannot reach proximal colon segment therefore may miss proximal colon present intend investigate prevalence proximal adenoma accord finding rectosigmoid colon find risk factor data collect retrospectively consecutive undergo total colonoscopy department gastroenterology hanyang university october december neoplasm classify diminutive adenoma mm villous,a,Colon Cancer
"Different regression equations relate age to the incidence of Lauren types 1 and 2 stomach cancer in the SEER database: these equations are unaffected by sex or race Although impacts upon gastric cancer incidence of race, age, sex, and Lauren type have been individually explored, neither their importance when evaluated together nor the presence or absence of interactions among them have not been fully described. This study, derived from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute) data, analyzed the incidences of gastric cancer between the years 1992–2001. There were 7882 patients who had developed gastric cancer. The total denominator population was 145,155, 669 persons (68,395,787 for 1992–1996, 78,759,882 for 1997–2001). Patients with multiple tumors were evaluated as per the default of the SEER*Stat program. 160 age-, five year period (1992–1996 vs 1997–2001)-, sex-, race (Asian vs non-Asian)-, Lauren type- specific incidences were derived to form the stratified sample evaluated by linear regression. (160 groups = 2 five year periods × 2 race groups × 2 sexes × 2 Lauren types × 10 age groups.) Linear regression was used to analyze the importance of each of these explanatory variables and to see if there were interactions among the explanatory variables. Race, sex, age group, and Lauren type were found to be important explanatory variables, as were interactions between Lauren type and each of the other important explanatory variables. In the final model, the contribution of each explanatory variable was highly statistically significant (t > 5, d.f. 151, P < 0.00001). The regression equation for Lauren type 1 had different coefficients for the explanatory variables Race, Sex, and Age, than did the regression equation for Lauren type 2. The change of the incidence of stomach cancer with respect to age for Lauren type 1 stomach cancer differs from that for Lauren type 2 stomach cancers. The relationships between age and Lauren type do not differ across gender or race. The results support the notion that Lauren type 1 and Lauren type 2 gastric cancers have different etiologies and different patterns of progression from pre-cancer to cancer. The results should be validated by evaluation of other databases.","different regression equations relate age to the incidence of lauren types 1 and 2 stomach cancer in the seer database: these equations are unaffected by sex or race although impacts upon gastric cancer incidence of race, age, sex, and lauren type have been individually explored, neither their importance when evaluated together nor the presence or absence of interactions among them have not been fully described. this study, derived from seer (surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program of the national cancer institute) data, analyzed the incidences of gastric cancer between the years 1992–2001. there were 7882 patients who had developed gastric cancer. the total denominator population was 145,155, 669 persons (68,395,787 for 1992–1996, 78,759,882 for 1997–2001). patients with multiple tumors were evaluated as per the default of the seer*stat program. 160 age-, five year period (1992–1996 vs 1997–2001)-, sex-, race (asian vs non-asian)-, lauren type- specific incidences were derived to",different regression equation relate age incidence lauren type stomach seer database equation unaffected sex race although impact upon gastric incidence race age sex lauren type individually explore neither importance evaluate together presence absence interaction among fully describe derive seer surveillance epidemiology end result seer program national institute data analyze incidence gastric year develop gastric total denominator population person multiple evaluate per default seer stat program age five year period v sex race asian v non asian lauren type specific incidence derive,d,Stomach Cancer
"Association of serum follistatin levels with histological types and progression of tumor in human lung cancer Follistatin (FST), an activin-binding protein, inhibits activin action by interfering with activin binding to its receptor. The prognostic value of FST has been studied in various cancers. However, these studies rarely focus on lung cancer. In our study, we investigated the relationship between serum FST levels and lung cancer with histologic types, TNM staging, and recurrence. A total of 150 serum samples were collected, including 91 from patients with SCLC or NSCLC, 22 from patients with benign lung diseases, and 37 from healthy subjects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum FST levels in healthy subjects, patients with benign lung diseases and patients with lung cancers. Serum FST levels in patients with LADC, SCC, LASC, LCLC, and SCLC were much higher than those in healthy subjects and in patients with lung benign disease. A ROC curve was constructed for differentiating the lung cancer from the healthy subjects and benign lung diseases. The results indicated that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.971 and 0.728 respectively. According to TNM staging, serum FST level increased significantly in patients with stage III and IV of LADC. Moreover, serum FST expression were increased in LADC patients with different TNM category. Furthermore, we found that a higher expression of serum FST was correlated with recurrence in LADC patients. The serum FST levels gradually increased with the rise of TNM staging and category in lung cancer patients. These data suggest that serum FST levels not only can be used in auxiliary diagnosis for lung cancer but also might be associated with the disease progression and metastasis of lung cancers.","association of serum follistatin levels with histological types and progression of tumor in human lung cancer follistatin (fst), an activin-binding protein, inhibits activin action by interfering with activin binding to its receptor. the prognostic value of fst has been studied in various cancers. however, these studies rarely focus on lung cancer. in our study, we investigated the relationship between serum fst levels and lung cancer with histologic types, tnm staging, and recurrence. a total of 150 serum samples were collected, including 91 from patients with sclc or nsclc, 22 from patients with benign lung diseases, and 37 from healthy subjects. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum fst levels in healthy subjects, patients with benign lung diseases and patients with lung cancers. serum fst levels in patients with ladc, scc, lasc, lclc, and sclc were much higher than those in healthy subjects and in patients with lung benign disease.",association serum follistatin level histological type progression human lung follistatin fst activin bind protein inhibits activin action interfere activin binding receptor prognostic value fst various however rarely focus lung investigate relationship serum fst level lung histologic type tnm staging recurrence total serum sample collect include sclc nsclc benign lung healthy subject enzyme link immunosorbent assay use determine serum fst level healthy subject benign lung lung serum fst level ladc scc lasc lclc sclc much high healthy subject lung benign,c,Lung Cancer
"Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes from lung cancer and noncancer patients: a correlation with family histories of cancer. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity was measured in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from cigarette smokers with and without primary lung cancer. Frequency distribution analysis of AHH induction ratios for the two groups revealed an increased number of individuals in the lung cancer patient group with high lymphocyte induction values (P less than 0.05). A similar increase was not shown for high-PAM AHH values in lung cancer patients (P greater than 0.2). When individual PAM and lymphocyte AHH values were compared between noncancer and lung cancer patients, a positive correlation was observed for noncancer patients (r=0.195, P less than 0.001), but no correlation of these values was noted for lung cancer patients. The lung cancer patients were divided into three subgroups of patients showing (I) high PAM and low lymphocyte AHH levels, (II) low PAM and low lymphocyte AHH levels, and (III) low PAM and high lymphocyte AHH levels. When the incidence of family history of cancer was compared for these subgroups, no family cancer history was recorded for persons in subgroup II; however, individuals in subgroups I and III presented family cancer history incidence of 9.5% and 39.3%, respectively. Patients in group III averaged 6 years younger than those in group I. These data suggest that familial factors may be identified among lung cancer patients and that these factors appear to associate as either a cause of an effect with the capacity of pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes to be induced for AHH. The data support the hypothesis that high AHH values may be characteristic of lung cancer patients but show that enzyme values determined from a single tissue, either PAMs or lymphocytes, may not be appropriate for showing whether high AHH inducibility is correlated with lung cancer.","aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes from lung cancer and noncancer patients: a correlation with family histories of cancer. aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (ahh) activity was measured in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (pams) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from cigarette smokers with and without primary lung cancer. frequency distribution analysis of ahh induction ratios for the two groups revealed an increased number of individuals in the lung cancer patient group with high lymphocyte induction values (p less than 0.05). a similar increase was not shown for high-pam ahh values in lung cancer patients (p greater than 0.2). when individual pam and lymphocyte ahh values were compared between noncancer and lung cancer patients, a positive correlation was observed for noncancer patients (r=0.195, p less than 0.001), but no correlation of these values was noted for lung cancer patients. the lung cancer patients were divided into three subgroups of patients showing",aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity pulmonary alveolar macrophage lymphocyte lung noncancer correlation family history aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase ahh activity measure pulmonary alveolar macrophage pams peripheral blood lymphocyte cigarette smoker without primary lung frequency distribution ahh induction ratio two group reveal increased number individual lung group high lymphocyte induction value p less similar increase show high pam ahh value lung p great individual pam lymphocyte ahh value compare noncancer lung positive correlation observe noncancer r p less correlation value note lung lung divide three subgroup show,c,Lung Cancer

"Surgical techniques, open versus minimally invasive gastrectomy after chemotherapy (STOMACH trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to provide important advantages in comparison with open procedures in the treatment of several malignant diseases, such as less perioperative blood loss and faster patient recovery. It also maintains similar results with regard to tumor resection margins and oncological long-term survival. In gastric cancer the role of laparoscopic surgery remains unclear. Current recommended treatment for gastric cancer consists of radical resection of the stomach, with a free margin of 5 to 6 cm from the tumor, combined with a lymphadenectomy. The extent of the lymphadenectomy is considered a marker for radicality of surgery and quality of care. Therefore, it is imperative that a novel surgical technique, such as minimally invasive total gastrectomy, should be non-inferior with regard to radicality of surgery and lymph node yield. The Surgical Techniques, Open versus Minimally invasive gastrectomy After CHemotherapy (STOMACH) study is a randomized, clinical multicenter trial. All adult patients with primary carcinoma of the stomach, in which the tumor is considered surgically resectable (T1-3, N0-1, M0) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, are eligible for inclusion and randomization. The primary endpoint is quality of oncological resection, measured by radicality of surgery and number of retrieved lymph nodes. The pathologist is blinded towards patient allocation. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) regarding quality of life, postoperative complications and cost-effectiveness. Based on a non-inferiority model for lymph node yield, with an average lymph node yield of 20, a non-inferiority margin of −4 and a 90% power to detect non-inferiority, a total of 168 patients are to be included.

"Dietary risk factors in intestinal and diffuse types of stomach cancer: a multicenter case-control study in Poland. A hospital-based, multicenter, case-control study has been performed in Poland covering 741 incident stomach-cancer cases (520 males and 221 females) and the same number of controls. All stomach-cancer diagnoses were evaluated for histologic type according to the Lauren criteria. Fifty-one percent were of the intestinal type, 35 percent of the diffuse type, and 8.5 percent of the mixed type. The frequency of consumption of individual food items and several food groups was analyzed and the association of various foods with stomach cancer risk was evaluated after controlling for sex, age, occupation, education, and residency. Increased consumption of sausages was related significantly to gastric cancer risk, whereas increased consumption of cheese products, nonwhite bread, vegetables, and fruit was associated with decreased risk. A particularly strong decrease in risk was associated with consumption of radishes and onions. When consumption of fruits and vegetables, sausages, nonwhite bread, and cheese were introduced simultaneously in a multivariate model, independent effects were found only for fruit and vegetables, sausages, and nonwhite bread. The use of table salt, the frequency of eating hot meals, and an irregular eating pattern were also associated with increased risk, while additional consumption of fruit between meals showed reduced risk. If a reduction in vegetable and fruit consumption took place after marriage, an increased risk for stomach cancer was found, whereas augmented consumption of these food items after marriage decreased the risk. Separate risk models were calculated for stomach cancer of the intestinal and diffuse types, but both histologic varieties showed the same pattern of associations with dietary risk factors.","dietary risk factors in intestinal and diffuse types of stomach cancer: a multicenter case-control study in poland. a hospital-based, multicenter, case-control study has been performed in poland covering 741 incident stomach-cancer cases (520 males and 221 females) and the same number of controls. all stomach-cancer diagnoses were evaluated for histologic type according to the lauren criteria. fifty-one percent were of the intestinal type, 35 percent of the diffuse type, and 8.5 percent of the mixed type. the frequency of consumption of individual food items and several food groups was analyzed and the association of various foods with stomach cancer risk was evaluated after controlling for sex, age, occupation, education, and residency. increased consumption of sausages was related significantly to gastric cancer risk, whereas increased consumption of cheese products, nonwhite bread, vegetables, and fruit was associated with decreased risk. a particularly strong decrease in risk was associated with consumption of radishes",dietary risk factor intestinal diffuse type stomach multicenter control poland hospital base multicenter control perform poland cover incident stomach male female number control stomach diagnosis evaluate histologic type accord lauren criterion fifty one percent intestinal type percent diffuse type percent mixed type frequency consumption individual food item several food group analyze association various food stomach risk evaluate control sex age occupation education residency increase consumption sausage relate significantly gastric risk whereas increase consumption cheese product nonwhite bread vegetable fruit associate decrease risk particularly strong decrease risk associate consumption radish,d,Stomach Cancer
"Gene expression profile of epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediators in papillary thyroid cancer. Platelet derived growth receptor alpha (PDGFRA) promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in thyroid follicular cells and is linked to lymphatic metastases in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We probed the regulatory network of genes linked to PDGFRA and EMT, comparing matched patient primary tumor and metastatic specimens, as well as engineered cell lines and ex vivo primary cultures with and without PDGFRA. Freshly isolated thyroid tumors with or without metastases, with matching neighboring benign or normal tissue, was isolated for comparative transcriptional analysis using a TaqMan Low Density array (TLDA) assay with genes representing important markers of EMT, cellular adhesion, apoptosis, differentiation, senescence, and signal transduction pathways in thyroid cancer. Transfected primary cultures and immortalized cell lines were also analyzed with respect to PDGFRA expression and cell phenotype. We reveal the consistent upregulation of serine protease DPP4 and structural protein SPP1 with the progression of PTC to metastatic disease, as well as with PDGFRA expression. Conversely, epithelial integrity gene TFF3 and transcription factor SOX10 were strongly down-regulated. This gene network also includes important mediators of EMT including DSG1, MMP3, MMP9, and BECN. We observed similar genomic changes in ex vivo normal thyroid cells transfected with PDGFRA that also exhibited a partially dedifferentiated phenotype. In particular, we observed lamellopodia with induction of PDGFRA and illustrate that DPP4 and SPP1 were upregulated in this process, with decreased TFF3 and SOX10 as seen in tissue specimens. PDGFRA did decrease nuclear protein levels of differentiation factor TTF1, but not the transcription of TTF1 and PAX8. We demonstrate that PDGFRA activates EMT pathways and decreases expression of genes favoring epithelial integrity, pushing follicular cells toward a dedifferentiated phenotype. SPP1 and DPP4, previously linked with adverse outcomes in thyroid cancer, appear to be regulated by PDGFRA.

"The association of body size, reproductive factors and thyroid cancer. A population-based case-control study of the association of diet and other factors and thyroid cancer was conducted between 1980 and 1987 on Oahu, Hawaii. Study participants included 51 men and 140 women with thyroid cancer, and 113 male and 328 female controls matched on age (+/- 5 years) and sex. A significant, positive monotonic dose-response relation of weight in late adulthood (5 years prior to interview) and the risk for thyroid cancer was found for men and women. A greater than five-fold increase in the risk for thyroid cancer among men, and more than a two-fold increase in risk among women, was found for subjects in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of weight in late adulthood. Height was significantly related to the risk for thyroid cancer among men, but not women. Among men, there was a significant dose-response relation of weight in early adulthood (20-29 years of age) and the odds ratios (ORs) for thyroid cancer, although the trend was not significant after adjustment for height. Among women, there was also a positive relation of adult weight gain and thyroid cancer, with an OR of 2.6 associated with more than a 14% increase in weight. The effects of relative weight and weight gain on thyroid cancer risk were stronger in post-menopausal women than in premenopausal women. There was a significant positive interaction between fertility drug use and early adult weight and the risk for thyroid cancer in women. Odds ratios were also significantly elevated for women above the median weight in early adulthood who experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth at first pregnancy. In summary, these data show an association of weight, particularly in late adulthood, and the risk for thyroid cancer in men and women, and further suggest a positive interaction between weight in young adulthood and fertility drug use on thyroid carcinogenesis in women.","the association of body size, reproductive factors and thyroid cancer. a population-based case-control study of the association of diet and other factors and thyroid cancer was conducted between 1980 and 1987 on oahu, hawaii. study participants included 51 men and 140 women with thyroid cancer, and 113 male and 328 female controls matched on age (+/- 5 years) and sex. a significant, positive monotonic dose-response relation of weight in late adulthood (5 years prior to interview) and the risk for thyroid cancer was found for men and women. a greater than five-fold increase in the risk for thyroid cancer among men, and more than a two-fold increase in risk among women, was found for subjects in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of weight in late adulthood. height was significantly related to the risk for thyroid cancer among men, but not women. among men, there was a significant dose-response",association body size reproductive factor thyroid population base control association diet factor thyroid conduct oahu hawaii participant include men woman thyroid male female control match age year sex significant positive monotonic dose response relation weight late adulthood year prior interview risk thyroid find men woman great five fold increase risk thyroid among men two fold increase risk among woman find subject high compare low quartile weight late adulthood height significantly relate risk thyroid among men woman among men significant dose response,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Extent of resection in surgery of stomach carcinoma The extraluminal extent of resection in cases of advanced gastric cancer is controversial. If, however, following meticulous staging--including the detection of free abdominal tumor cells--complete resection seems possible, then multivisceral resection is justified. If complete resection is achieved, the prognosis of these patients can be improved. Left pancreatic resection should be performed only if the tumor invades the pancreas directly. Splenectomy is indicated if the tumor invades the organ directly or if there are locally advanced tumors of the proximal third of the stomach and tumors of the esophageal-gastric junction. However, it has to be kept in mind that splenectomy is an independent negative prognostic factor. The extent of lymphadenectomy (LA) in gastric cancer is still under discussion. According to the 10-year results of the Dutch Gastric Cancer Study, there might be subgroups which have a survival benefit after extended (D2) LA. These include, as the German Gastric Cancer Study corroborated, patients with very early stage II and stage IIIa lymph node metastases. As neither of these stages can at present be diagnosed before or during surgery, D2 lymphadenectomy should be the standard procedure for all patients with gastric cancer. Recent studies have shown that it might be possible with the help of the Sentinel Node Technique to individualize lymphadenectomy in locally gastric cancer as well. The beneficial effects of adjuvant chemoradiation in gastric cancer do not mean, however, that the extent of resection may be reduced. Adjuvant chemoradiation following complete resection and D2 lymphadenectomy should still not be regarded as standard therapy.","extent of resection in surgery of stomach carcinoma the extraluminal extent of resection in cases of advanced gastric cancer is controversial. if, however, following meticulous staging--including the detection of free abdominal tumor cells--complete resection seems possible, then multivisceral resection is justified. if complete resection is achieved, the prognosis of these patients can be improved. left pancreatic resection should be performed only if the tumor invades the pancreas directly. splenectomy is indicated if the tumor invades the organ directly or if there are locally advanced tumors of the proximal third of the stomach and tumors of the esophageal-gastric junction. however, it has to be kept in mind that splenectomy is an independent negative prognostic factor. the extent of lymphadenectomy (la) in gastric cancer is still under discussion. according to the 10-year results of the dutch gastric cancer study, there might be subgroups which have a survival benefit after extended (d2) la.",extent resection surgery stomach carcinoma extraluminal extent resection advanced gastric controversial however follow meticulous stag include detection free abdominal cell complete resection seem possible multivisceral resection justified complete resection achieve prognosis improve left pancreatic resection perform invade pancreas directly splenectomy indicate invade organ directly locally advanced proximal third stomach esophageal gastric junction however keep mind splenectomy independent negative prognostic factor extent lymphadenectomy la gastric still discussion accord year result dutch gastric might subgroups survival benefit extend la,d,Stomach Cancer

"Changing natural history of differentiated thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing in many countries over the last 30 years. In the USA, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 3.6/100.000 people in 1973 to 8.7/100.000 people in 2002 [1]. This phenomenon is mainly due to an increase in the papillary histotype, which raised from 2.7 to 7.7/100.000, a 2.9-fold increase. The same trend has been reported in Europe [2]. The bulk of the increase is probably the results of better detection of small cancer, measuring 1.5 cm or less. Despite increasing incidence, the mortality from papillary thyroid cancer remained stable (0.5 deaths/100.000 in both 1973 and 2002) [1]. A recent study by Pagano et al. [3] confirm this trend in thyroid cancer patients diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in north Italy, in an area characterized by moderate iodine deficiency. The authors compared the epidemiological and clinico-pathological features of patients according to the time of diagnosis (1997–2005 and 2006–2010). The cut off of 2005 was chosen because it is coincident with the introduction of iodine prophylaxis and with the adoption of international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer [4, 5]. The main finding is that in more recent years, cancers were diagnosed at an earlier stage, in agreement with the similar observation in other European and North American countries. Increased scrutiny of the thyroid gland, mainly by neck ultrasound, is the most likely explanation for this phenomenon, but the other possibility is that some, as yet unknown, carcinogens in the environment might play a role. Up to now, the only established environmental risk factor for thyroid carcinoma is exposure to ionizing radiation, and the risk, particularly of papillary carcinoma, is greater in subjects of younger age at exposure, as demonstrated following the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 [6]. According to a network of populationbased cancer registries in Italy [7], the temporal trend for thyroid cancer in the period 1988–2002 showed a statistically significant increase of incidence rates in both male and females, that overall showed an annual percent increase of 4.0 % similar to the 3.8 % observed in USA [1]. Based on temporal relationship, it has been claimed that the increase might be a consequence of the Chernobyl fallout. However, no increase in thyroid gland abnormalities, such as nodularity or cancer, was found in northern Italy, among children already born at the time of Chernobyl nuclear accident, when examined 10 years after [8]. This epidemiological evidence does not favor any link between the Chernobyl accident and the increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma in countries other than Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Of particular interest is the finding that nearly 20 % of the patients reported by Pagano et al. [3] had an occupational exposure in textile industries. Although the study did not include a control group with the same exposure, the finding recalls a previous Chinese study [9] documenting an association between thyroid cancer and possible exposure to formaldehyde and benzene during long-term employment in textile industries. Another novel finding of Pagano et al. [3] is that cancers diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 presented more frequent association with autoimmune thyroid phenomena. The last observation might be linked to the augmented iodine intake after establishment of iodine prophylaxis in the country and it is in keeping with the evidence that in countries with high nutritional iodine intake the incidence of autoimmune thyroid disorders is higher compared to countries with F.

"SoLAT (Sorafenib Lenvatinib alternating treatment): a new treatment protocol with alternating Sorafenib and Lenvatinib for refractory thyroid Cancer. In the last decade, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which disrupt pathways involved in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer, have been extensively studied. Two different TKIs, lenvatinib and sorafenib, were recently approved by both the US FDA and European Medicine Agency. Until date, the duration of the TKI response is not sufficient and resistance eventually occurs. The goal of this study was to investigate a new treatment protocol, SoLAT, using sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively on refractory thyroid cancer. Patient-derived aggressive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell lines from patients with biochemical and histologically proven aggressive RAI-refractory papillary thyroid cancer were exposed to sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. Human thyroid cancer cell xenografts were obtained by injecting patient-derived aggressive PTC cell lines into the flank of female BALB/c nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. Cell viability assay, immunofluorescence analysis, confocal imaging, immunoblot analysis, flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle and a tube formation assay were performed. SoLAT was more effective for advanced PTC cell lines than individual treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that SoLAT markedly increased levels of cell cycle inhibitors (p53 and p21), and pro-apoptotic factors (Apaf-1 and cleaved caspase 3) and decreased levels of positive cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6) and anti-apoptotic factors (p-NFκB, Bcl-2). Increased sub-G0/G1 population was observed in the SoLAT group, leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and strong inhibition of advanced PTC cell viability. SoLAT reduced the level of EMT markers such as vimentin, E-cadherin, Snail and Zeb1 by FGFR inhibition. In the xenograft model, individual treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib did not markedly suppress patient-derived aggressive PTC cell xenograft tumors, whereas SoLAT significantly suppressed the proliferation of these tumors. SoLAT was more effective than individual treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib in inhibiting PTC progression by inducing cell cycle arrest. Studies using both in vitro cell culture and an in vivo xenograft model provided evidence of tumor shrinkage with SoLAT. We suggest that these effects may be due to reduced EMT-mediated drug resistance in the aggressive PTC model.","solat (sorafenib lenvatinib alternating treatment): a new treatment protocol with alternating sorafenib and lenvatinib for refractory thyroid cancer. in the last decade, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis), which disrupt pathways involved in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer, have been extensively studied. two different tkis, lenvatinib and sorafenib, were recently approved by both the us fda and european medicine agency. until date, the duration of the tki response is not sufficient and resistance eventually occurs. the goal of this study was to investigate a new treatment protocol, solat, using sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively on refractory thyroid cancer. patient-derived aggressive papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) cell lines from patients with biochemical and histologically proven aggressive rai-refractory papillary thyroid cancer were exposed to sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. human thyroid cancer cell xenografts were obtained by injecting patient-derived aggressive ptc cell lines into the flank of female balb/c nude mice. tumor-bearing mice were",solat sorafenib lenvatinib alternate new protocol alternate sorafenib lenvatinib refractory thyroid last decade several tyrosine kinase inhibitor tkis disrupt pathway involve proliferation tumorigenesis thyroid extensively studied two different tkis lenvatinib sorafenib recently approve u fda european medicine agency date duration tki response sufficient resistance eventually occur goal investigate new protocol solat use sorafenib lenvatinib alternatively refractory thyroid derive aggressive papillary thyroid ptc cell line biochemical histologically proven aggressive rai refractory papillary thyroid expose sorafenib lenvatinib alternatively human thyroid cell xenograft obtain inject derive aggressive ptc cell line flank female balb c nude mice bearing mouse,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Metal concentrations in lung tissue of subjects suffering from lung cancer. Concentrations of nine metals (Fe, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb and Cr) concentrations in lung tissues from 224 lung cancer cases were compared with those in other cases to achieve an understanding of their contribution to the development of lung cancer and the varieties after the development of cancer. Comparisons of metal concentrations in each cell type of lung cancer were also performed. All cases were collected from routine autopsies in Tokyo and Saitama, Japan. The copper concentration in tissue from lung cancers was significantly higher than that in other specimens, although calcium, magnesium, zinc and cobalt concentrations in lung cancers were significantly lower than those in other cases. There were no significant differences in the 99% intervals (excluding extremely high values for occupationally exposed cases) for chromium, nickel and lead concentrations between lung cancers and other cases, although these values were lower in lung cancers. However, in comparisons of men only, the chromium concentration, the degree of lung contamination and the severity of pulmonary emphysema in lung cancer cases were significantly higher than those in other specimens. Moreover, percentages of lung cancer in men at each degree of contamination and each severity of emphysema increased with increasing grades. Thus, this finding could be evidence that the exposure to contaminants other than chromium and nickel in the air had affected the development of lung cancer, except for occupationally exposed individuals. Therefore, almost all chromium and nickel in lung tissue might not deposit in carcinogenic forms such as hexavalent chromium or nickel subsulfide. Comparison of the characteristics in each cell type of lung cancer revealed that calcium and chromium concentrations in lung tissue (not including tumor) or squamous cell carcinomas were higher than those in the other cell types. In small cell carcinomas, calcium magnesium and zinc concentrations were low.","metal concentrations in lung tissue of subjects suffering from lung cancer. concentrations of nine metals (fe, ca, mg, zn, cu, co, ni, pb and cr) concentrations in lung tissues from 224 lung cancer cases were compared with those in other cases to achieve an understanding of their contribution to the development of lung cancer and the varieties after the development of cancer. comparisons of metal concentrations in each cell type of lung cancer were also performed. all cases were collected from routine autopsies in tokyo and saitama, japan. the copper concentration in tissue from lung cancers was significantly higher than that in other specimens, although calcium, magnesium, zinc and cobalt concentrations in lung cancers were significantly lower than those in other cases. there were no significant differences in the 99% intervals (excluding extremely high values for occupationally exposed cases) for chromium, nickel and lead concentrations between lung cancers and other",metal concentration lung tissue subject suffer lung concentration nine metal fe ca mg zn cu co ni pb cr concentration lung tissue lung compare achieve understanding contribution development lung variety development comparison metal concentration cell type lung also perform collect routine autopsy tokyo saitama japan copper concentration tissue lung significantly high specimen although calcium magnesium zinc cobalt concentration lung significantly low significant difference interval exclude extremely high value occupationally expose chromium nickel lead concentration lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting Stat3 activation Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer development have not been fully understood. The functions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), a class of total eighteen proteins (HDAC1–11 and SIRT1–7 in mammals) that deacetylate histones and non-histone proteins, in cancers are largely unknown. Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice and HDAC7-depleted human lung cancer cell lines were used as models for studying the function of Hdac7 gene in lung cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to explore the relationship between HDAC7 expression and prognosis of human lung cancers. Recombinant lentivirus-mediated in vivo gene expression or knockdown, Western blotting, and pull-down assay were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis. The number and burden of lung tumor were dramatically reduced in Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice compared to control K-Ras mice. Also, in Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and apoptosis in lung tumors was greatly enhanced. Similarly, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of human lung cancer cell lines expressing shHDAC7 were also significantly suppressed and apoptosis was dramatically elevated respectively. Mechanistic study revealed that Hdac7 mutation in mouse lung tumors or HDAC7 depletion in human tumor cell lines resulted in significantly enhanced acetylation and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Stat3 and HDAC7 protein directly interacted with and deacetylateed STAT3. The Hdac7 mutant-mediated inhibitory effects on lung tumorigenesis in mice and cell proliferation/soft agar colony formation of human lung cancer cell lines were respectively reversed by expressing dnStat3. Finally, the high HDAC7 mRNA level was found to be correlated with poor prognosis of human lung cancer patients. Our study suggests that Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting Stat3 activation via deacetylating Stat3 and may shed a light on the design of new therapeutic strategies for human lung cancer.","hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting stat3 activation lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer development have not been fully understood. the functions of histone deacetylases (hdacs), a class of total eighteen proteins (hdac1–11 and sirt1–7 in mammals) that deacetylate histones and non-histone proteins, in cancers are largely unknown. hdac7; +/−/k-ras mice and hdac7-depleted human lung cancer cell lines were used as models for studying the function of hdac7 gene in lung cancer. kaplan-meier survival analysis was performed to explore the relationship between hdac7 expression and prognosis of human lung cancers. recombinant lentivirus-mediated in vivo gene expression or knockdown, western blotting, and pull-down assay were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis. the number and burden of lung tumor were dramatically reduced in hdac7; +/−/k-ras mice compared to control k-ras mice. also, in hdac7;",hdac promotes lung tumorigenesis inhibit stat activation lung lead cause death worldwide however molecular mechanism underlie lung development fully understood function histone deacetylases hdacs class total eighteen protein hdac sirt mammal deacetylate histone non histone protein largely unknown hdac k ras mouse hdac deplete human lung cell line use model function hdac gene lung kaplan meier survival perform explore relationship hdac expression prognosis human lung recombinant lentivirus mediate vivo gene expression knockdown western blotting pull assay apply investigate underlying molecular mechanism hdac promote lung tumorigenesis number burden lung dramatically reduce hdac k ras mouse compare control k ra mouse also hdac,c,Lung Cancer
"The risk of second malignancy after adjuvant chemotherapy for stomach cancer. BACKGROUND: Although many trials have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for patients with stomach cancer, the benefits of ACT remain unclear. Moreover, some authors have reported that ACT increased the incidence of second malignancy. The risk of second malignancy was evaluated in patients who underwent treatment for stomach cancer in the past 20 years at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.METHODS: The study population consisted of 1925 patients who underwent gastrectomies for stomach cancer between the years 1978 and 1992 and who received follow-up examinations to check for second malignancies. They included 1114 patients who underwent surgery only (group A) and 811 who underwent surgery and received chemotherapy (group B). The observed incidence of second malignancy (O) was compared with the expected incidence (E), calculated by the person-year method, using data from the Cancer Registry in Osaka.RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 7.99 years. The total number of patients with a second malignancy was 127 (men, 97; women, 30); 72 patients had the second malignancy in digestive organs; 27 in respiratory organs; and 28 in other organs. The relative risks of a second malignancy in group A and B patients were 1.05 and 1.02 (differences between the two groups were not significant). The relative risks of a second malignancy in patients who received ACT with 5-fluorouracil, Tegafur and Uracil, and FT207 were 0.79, 1.01, and 1.06, respectively (differences between the groups were not significant).CONCLUSION: The risk of second malignancy after chemotherapy for stomach cancer was not high in comparison with the expected incidence. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not increase the risk of a second malignancy.","the risk of second malignancy after adjuvant chemotherapy for stomach cancer. background: although many trials have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy (act) for patients with stomach cancer, the benefits of act remain unclear. moreover, some authors have reported that act increased the incidence of second malignancy. the risk of second malignancy was evaluated in patients who underwent treatment for stomach cancer in the past 20 years at osaka medical center for cancer and cardiovascular diseases.methods: the study population consisted of 1925 patients who underwent gastrectomies for stomach cancer between the years 1978 and 1992 and who received follow-up examinations to check for second malignancies. they included 1114 patients who underwent surgery only (group a) and 811 who underwent surgery and received chemotherapy (group b). the observed incidence of second malignancy (o) was compared with the expected incidence (e), calculated by the person-year method, using",risk second malignancy adjuvant chemotherapy stomach although many trial conduct evaluate feasibility effectiveness adjuvant chemotherapy act stomach benefit act remain unclear moreover report act increase incidence second malignancy risk second malignancy evaluate undergo stomach past year osaka medical center cardiovascular population consist underwent gastrectomy stomach year receive follow examination check second malignancy include undergo surgery group underwent surgery receive chemotherapy group b observed incidence second malignancy compare expected incidence e calculate person year method use,d,Stomach Cancer
"A novel long non-coding RNA, PICSAR, promotes thyroid cancer progression through the hsa-miR-320A/hsa-miR-485/RAPGEFL1 axis. Among endocrine cancers, thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most prevalent and ranks sixth in global mortality rates. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) is associated with the progression of various human cancers, including TC. The role of PICSAR lncRNA (LINC00162) has been validated in different human cancers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the expression levels and functions of lncRNA PICSAR in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis. This comprehensive approach combined in silico and in vitro methods to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of PICSAR in thyroid cancer. This work assessed the expression of the long non-coding RNA LINC00162 and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Interactions among LINC00162, hsa-miR-320A, hsa-miR-485, and RAPGEFL1 were investigated using the LncACT and miRDB databases. Bioinformatics techniques were employed to conduct functional enrichment analysis to clarify the relevant molecular pathways. For the investigation of LINC00162 expression in TC samples, 50 matched samples of thyroid carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue were gathered. Real time PCR was used to objectively evaluate the expression levels of the targeted genes. Every tissue sample was examined pathologically. A specific siRNA was transfected into a thyroid cancer cell line to examine the functional role of LINC00162. The impact of LINC00162 silencing was then assessed by measuring the level of target genes expression following the transfection. Based on TCGA-THCA analysis and qRT-PCR on tissue samples, LINC00162 (PICSAR) was markedly overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues compared to normal samples. However, no discernible correlation was found between LINC00162 expression and the pathological characteristics of thyroid cancer. Our bioinformatics predictions based on lncRNA-microRNA interactions demonstrate that LINC00162 acts as a molecular sponge for the downregulated microRNAs hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485 in thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1, a gene associated with the development of thyroid cancer, is upregulated in conjunction with this downregulation. The LINC00162-miRNA-RAPGEFL1 axis is involved in critical carcinogenic processes, including thiamine metabolism, cell cycle control, and folate biosynthesis, according to functional enrichment analysis. Additionally, a bioinformatics study revealed a negative association between PICSAR and the NUDT3 gene, while a positive correlation was found with the SNX18P14 gene. Thyroid cancer cells transfected with LINC00162-specific siRNA showed significant downregulation of LINC00162 and RAPGEFL1, alongside an increase in hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, ultimately inhibiting the growth of thyroid cancer. These findings suggest that targeting PICSAR may offer a treatment strategy for thyroid cancer by altering important biological processes. In conclusion, LINC00162, which is overexpressed in thyroid cancer, acts as a molecular sponge for hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, regulating key oncogenic pathways and leading to the upregulation of RAPGEFL1. These effects are reversed upon siRNA-mediated silencing of LINC00162, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1 regulates the Rap signaling pathway, controlling adhesion, migration, polarity, and metabolism to maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis. Its dysregulation is linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.","a novel long non-coding rna, picsar, promotes thyroid cancer progression through the hsa-mir-320a/hsa-mir-485/rapgefl1 axis. among endocrine cancers, thyroid carcinoma (tc) is the most prevalent and ranks sixth in global mortality rates. aberrant expression of long non-coding rna (lncrnas) is associated with the progression of various human cancers, including tc. the role of picsar lncrna (linc00162) has been validated in different human cancers. therefore, this study aimed to assess the expression levels and functions of lncrna picsar in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis. this comprehensive approach combined in silico and in vitro methods to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of picsar in thyroid cancer. this work assessed the expression of the long non-coding rna linc00162 and identified differentially expressed genes (degs) using the cancer genome atlas (tcga) database. interactions among linc00162, hsa-mir-320a, hsa-mir-485, and rapgefl1 were investigated using the lncact and mirdb databases. bioinformatics techniques were employed to conduct functional enrichment",novel long non cod rna picsar promote thyroid progression hsa mir hsa mir rapgefl axis among endocrine thyroid carcinoma tc prevalent rank sixth global mortality rate aberrant expression long non cod rna lncrnas associate progression various human include tc role picsar lncrna linc validate different human therefore assess expression level function lncrna picsar thyroid tumorigenesis comprehensive approach combine silico vitro method explore molecular mechanism significance picsar thyroid work assess expression long non cod rna linc identify differentially express gene degs use genome atlas tcga database interaction among linc hsa mir hsa mir rapgefl investigate use lncact mirdb database bioinformatics technique employ conduct functional enrichment,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Tumour-promotion by lime oil in the mouse forestomach. IN a recent communication1 it was shown that four different citrus oils promoted tumour development in mouse skin after pretreatment with a sub-carcinogenic dose of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA). Since man is continuously exposed to these oils in his food, it was decided to test one of them, lime oil, both for carcinogenicity and for tumour-promoting activity in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice. Another reason was the hope of demonstrating the two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis in the alimentary canal. Previous attempts to do this have given inconclusive results2,3. In the most recent of these, Berenblum and Haran gave mice a single dose of one of four polycyclic hydrocarbons followed by 3 per cent croton oil weekly for 30 weeks. All treatments were given by stomach tube, and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) was the solvent throughout. The appropriate control groups were included. Numerous tumours of the fore-stomach developed in all their groups, both test and control. It was not stated whether the rest of the intestinal tract was examined. No evidence for tumour-promotion by croton oil was obtained. There are three possible reasons for this: (1) The doses of the hydrocarbons used were too high. Bock and King4 have since shown that the mouse forestomach is more sensitive than the skin to carcinogenic hydrocarbons. (2) Croton oil, in the concentration used, was carcinogenic. (3) PEG, although a suitable solvent for a single dose of a hydrocarbon5, reduces the tumour yield when given repeatedly after such a dose6 and is not, therefore, a suitable solvent for tumour-promoting substances.","tumour-promotion by lime oil in the mouse forestomach. in a recent communication1 it was shown that four different citrus oils promoted tumour development in mouse skin after pretreatment with a sub-carcinogenic dose of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (dmba). since man is continuously exposed to these oils in his food, it was decided to test one of them, lime oil, both for carcinogenicity and for tumour-promoting activity in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice. another reason was the hope of demonstrating the two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis in the alimentary canal. previous attempts to do this have given inconclusive results2,3. in the most recent of these, berenblum and haran gave mice a single dose of one of four polycyclic hydrocarbons followed by 3 per cent croton oil weekly for 30 weeks. all treatments were given by stomach tube, and polyethylene glycol 400 (peg) was the solvent throughout. the appropriate control groups were included. numerous tumours of",promotion lime oil mouse forestomach recent communication show four different citrus oil promote development mouse skin pretreatment sub carcinogenic dose dimethyl benzanthracene dmba since man continuously expose oil food decide test one lime oil carcinogenicity promoting activity gastro intestinal tract mouse another reason hope demonstrate two stage mechanism carcinogenesis alimentary canal previous attempt give inconclusive result recent berenblum haran give mouse single dose one four polycyclic hydrocarbon follow per cent croton oil weekly week give stomach tube polyethylene glycol peg solvent throughout appropriate control group include numerous,d,Stomach Cancer

"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms in colon and lung cancer patients N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolizes arylamines and hydrazines moeities found in many therapeutic drugs, chemicals and carcinogens. The gene encoding NAT2 is polymorphic, thus resulting in rapid or slow acetylator phenotypes. The acetylator status may, therefore, predispose drug-induced toxicities and cancer risks, such as bladder, colon and lung cancer. Indeed, some studies demonstrate a positive association between NAT2 rapid acetylator phenotype and colon cancer, but results are inconsistent. The role of NAT2 acetylation status in lung cancer is likewise unclear, in which both the rapid and slow acetylator genotypes have been associated with disease. We investigated three genetic variations, c.481C>T, c.590G>A (p.R197Q) and c.857G>A (p.G286E), of the NAT2 gene, which are known to result in a slow acetylator phenotype. Using validated PCR-RFLP assays, we genotyped 243 healthy unrelated Caucasian control subjects, 92 colon and 67 lung cancer patients for these genetic variations. As there is a recent meta-analysis of NAT2 studies on colon cancer (unlike in lung cancer), we have also undertaken a systematic review of NAT2 studies on lung cancer, and we incorporated our results in a meta-analysis consisting of 16 studies, 3,865 lung cancer patients and 6,077 control subjects. We did not obtain statistically significant differences in NAT2 allele and genotype frequencies in colon cancer patients and control group. Certain genotypes, however, such as [c.590AA+c.857GA] and [c.590GA+c.857GA] were absent among the colon cancer patients. Similarly, allele frequencies in lung cancer patients and controls did not differ significantly. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase of genotypes [c.590GA] and [c.481CT+c.590GA], but absence of homozygous c.590AA and [c.590AA+c.857GA] in the lung cancer group. Meta-analysis of 16 NAT2 studies on lung cancer did not evidence an overall association of the rapid or slow acetylator status to lung cancer. Similarly, the summary odds ratios obtained with stratified meta-analysis based on ethnicity, and smoking status were not significant.

"Salvage treatment with irinotecan/cisplatin versus pemetrexed/cisplatin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer pre-treated with a non-platinum-based regimen in the first-line setting: a randomized phase II study of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (HORG) Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard front-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, non-platinum combinations of third-generation chemotherapeutic agents are considered an alternative therapeutic option for patients who cannot tolerate the toxic effects of platinum compounds. In this study, the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan plus cisplatin (IC) was compared to pemetrexed plus cisplatin (PC) regimen, in platinum-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, who had been previously treated with the combination of a taxane plus gemcitabine. A total of 124 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomly assigned to either irinotecan 110 mg/m2 on day 1 and 100 mg/m2 on day 8 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 8 every 3 weeks (IC arm) or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks (PC arm). The primary endpoint of the study was the overall response rate (ORR). The ORR and median progression-free survival (PFS) in the IC arm were 18 % and 3.3 months, respectively, while in the PC arm were 19 % and 4.2 months (p = ns). Median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in patients with PC (6.9 vs. 10.9; p = 0.013). PC regimen had a better toxicity profile compared to IC, with a statistically significant lower incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia (3 vs. 31 %; p = 0.0001) and diarrhea (1.6 vs. 14.7 %, p = 0.018). In patients with advanced NSCLC pretreated with docetaxel/gemcitabine, the combination of pemetrexed/cisplatin is associated with increased OS and is better tolerated than the combination of irinotecan/cisplatin and should be considered as a valid therapeutic option for platinum-naive, previously treated patients.

"Constitutive TDO2 expression promotes liver cancer progression by an autocrine IL-6 signaling pathway. Background Increased tryptophan (Trp) metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) represents one of the most studied pathways for immunosuppression in tumor tissues. However, the pro-tumor effects induced by Trp metabolism remain controversial. Methods The paraffin sections of tumor tissues were obtained from patients with liver cancer and examined by immunohistochemical staining to investigate the role of Trp metabolic enzymes. To further confirm the pro-tumor effects induced by TDO2, we established TDO2 overexpression SMC-7721 and HepG2 liver cancer cell lines, and western blotting, cell proliferation, and colony formation were evaluated. Meanwhile, liver cancer subcutaneous mice models were established, and the tumorigenic rates of SMC-7721 cells, tumor volume and survival of bearing mice were calculated. In addition, the survival data of liver cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded to analyze the effect of TDO2 expression on the survival of patients with liver cancer. Results Here, we showed that constitutive TDO2 expression gave rise to liver cancer through upregulation of Trp metabolism. And the TDO2 expression was positively correlated with the poor prognosis in liver cancer patients. TDO2 expression in tumor cells accounted for the release of kynurenine (Kyn), which activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to promote liver cancer cells proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that AhR expression contributed to the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), thereby promoting tumor cells proliferation through the STAT3 and NF-kB/TIM4 signals. Interrupt of AhR signals by PDM2 revealed improved outcomes in subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Together, our study showed that the TDO2/Kyn/AhR/IL-6 signaling pathway was a novel mechanism underlying the malignancy of liver cancer, and suggested that AhR signals might be a valuable therapeutic target for tumor therapy.","constitutive tdo2 expression promotes liver cancer progression by an autocrine il-6 signaling pathway. background increased tryptophan (trp) metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido)/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (tdo) represents one of the most studied pathways for immunosuppression in tumor tissues. however, the pro-tumor effects induced by trp metabolism remain controversial. methods the paraffin sections of tumor tissues were obtained from patients with liver cancer and examined by immunohistochemical staining to investigate the role of trp metabolic enzymes. to further confirm the pro-tumor effects induced by tdo2, we established tdo2 overexpression smc-7721 and hepg2 liver cancer cell lines, and western blotting, cell proliferation, and colony formation were evaluated. meanwhile, liver cancer subcutaneous mice models were established, and the tumorigenic rates of smc-7721 cells, tumor volume and survival of bearing mice were calculated. in addition, the survival data of liver cancer patients from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) database were downloaded to analyze the effect of",constitutive tdo expression promote liver progression autocrine il signal pathway increase tryptophan trp metabolism indoleamine dioxygenase ido tryptophan dioxygenase tdo represent one studied pathway immunosuppression tissue however pro effect induce trp metabolism remain controversial method paraffin section tissue obtain liver examine immunohistochemical staining investigate role trp metabolic enzyme confirm pro effect induce tdo establish tdo overexpression smc hepg liver cell line western blotting cell proliferation colony formation evaluate meanwhile liver subcutaneous mouse model establish tumorigenic rate smc cell volume survival bear mouse calculate addition survival data liver genome atlas tcga database download analyze effect,b,Liver Cancer
"Health-Related Quality of Life After Thyroid Cancer Surgery: A Single-Center, Cross-Sectional Study in Southern Vietnam. Background Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease in the endocrine glands. Symptoms of the disease affect the functions of organs in the body. Although thyroid cancer is often considered a ""good cancer"" because it progresses slowly, the likelihood of successful treatment is quite high; what is special is that the effect on the quality of life (QoL) is on par with more severe types of cancer. Currently, studies on QoL assessment in thyroid cancer patients are quite limited in southern Vietnam. The present study investigated the potential risk factors of deterioration in QoL scores in thyroid cancer patients after thyroidectomy. Methodology A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 162 patients who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy at the University Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from February to May 2023. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with patients and from medical records. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 was used to assess the QoL one month after thyroidectomy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to QoL with statistical significance set at p-value <0.05. Results The mean overall QoL in thyroid cancer survivors was 84.4 ± 10.00 (on a scale of 0-100, where 100 was the best). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the factors related to QoL after thyroidectomy were surgery type (p < 0.001), having a comorbidity (p = 0.029), economic status (p = 0.026), and hormone disorder (p = 0.009). Conclusions Our study indicated that surgery type, having a comorbidity, economic status, and hormone disorders were independent risk factors for decreased QoL one month after thyroidectomy. It is necessary to thoroughly assess the QoL before and after surgery in thyroid cancer patients. Longer follow-up QoL studies should be performed with larger sample sizes for more accurate results.","health-related quality of life after thyroid cancer surgery: a single-center, cross-sectional study in southern vietnam. background thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease in the endocrine glands. symptoms of the disease affect the functions of organs in the body. although thyroid cancer is often considered a ""good cancer"" because it progresses slowly, the likelihood of successful treatment is quite high; what is special is that the effect on the quality of life (qol) is on par with more severe types of cancer. currently, studies on qol assessment in thyroid cancer patients are quite limited in southern vietnam. the present study investigated the potential risk factors of deterioration in qol scores in thyroid cancer patients after thyroidectomy. methodology a descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 162 patients who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy at the university medical center ho chi minh city, vietnam, from",health related quality life thyroid surgery single center cross sectional southern vietnam thyroid common malignant endocrine glands symptom affect function organ body although thyroid often consider good progress slowly likelihood successful quite high special effect quality life qol par severe type currently qol assessment thyroid quite limit southern vietnam present investigate potential risk factor deterioration qol score thyroid thyroidectomy methodology descriptive cross sectional perform total diagnose thyroid underwent thyroidectomy university medical center ho chi minh city vietnam,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Decrease of prostaglandin I2 binding sites in thyroid cancer. The properties of specific prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin, PGI2) binding sites in normal thyroid tissue have been characterised. Tissue samples obtained intraoperatively from patients with 'cold' solitary thyroid nodules (as preoperatively selected by thyroid gland scintigraphy, thyroid gland ultrasonography and Papanicolaou cytology following fine needle aspiration of the nodule area) have been used for thyroid membrane preparation. Employing [3H]iloprost, a chemically stable PGI2-analogue as a radioligand, saturation experiments for comparative binding studies have been attempted. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for normal thyroid parenchyma distant to the nodule area revealed heterogeneity of the [3H]iloprost sites exhibiting a high-affinity binding capacity (Bmax) of 613.2 +/- 130.4 fmol mg-1 membrane protein and a low-affinity binding capacity of 5.1 +/- 1.6 pmol mg-1 membrane protein. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) amounted to 18.9 +/- 8.9 nM and to 131.5 +/- 39.2 nM, respectively. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for benign thyroid adenoma indicated significant lower binding capacities exhibiting a Bmax of 325.8 +/- 110.0 fmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 31.0 +/- 7.5 nM) for the high-affinity sites and of 3.9 +/- 2.5 pmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 364.9 +/- 183.6) for the low affinity sites. In cancer tissue a selective loss of the low affinity sites and a significant diminution of the high-affinity sites was observed: in well differentiated cancer the high-affinity sites showed a Bmax of 299.7 +/- 46.0 fmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 38.9 +/- 7.3 nM), in anaplastic cancer, less differentiated papillar and follicular cancers of 180.6 +/- 25.1 fmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 54.6 +/- 16.7 nM).

"Does remnant gastric cancer really differ from primary gastric cancer? A systematic review of the literature by the Task Force of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. Remnant gastric cancer, most frequently defined as cancer detected in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for benign disease and those cases after surgery of gastric cancer at least 5 years after the primary surgery, is often reported as a tumor with poor prognosis. The Task Force of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association for Research Promotion evaluated the clinical impact of remnant gastric cancer by systematically reviewing publications focusing on molecular carcinogenesis, lymph node status, patient survival, and surgical complications. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE with the keywords ""remnant,"" ""stomach,"" and ""cancer,"" revealing 1154 relevant reports published up to the end of December 2014. The mean interval between the initial surgery and the diagnosis of remnant gastric cancer ranged from 10 to 30 years. The incidence of lymph node metastases at the splenic hilum for remnant gastric cancer is not significantly higher than that for primary proximal gastric cancer. Lymph node involvement in the jejunal mesentery is a phenomenon peculiar to remnant gastric cancer after Billroth II reconstruction. Prognosis and postoperative morbidity and mortality rates seem to be comparable to those for primary proximal gastric cancer. The crude 5-year mortality for remnant gastric cancer was 1.08 times higher than that for primary proximal gastric cancer, but this difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, although no prospective cohort study has yet evaluated the clinical significance of remnant gastric cancer, our literature review suggests that remnant gastric cancer does not adversely affect patient prognosis and postoperative course.","does remnant gastric cancer really differ from primary gastric cancer? a systematic review of the literature by the task force of japanese gastric cancer association. remnant gastric cancer, most frequently defined as cancer detected in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for benign disease and those cases after surgery of gastric cancer at least 5 years after the primary surgery, is often reported as a tumor with poor prognosis. the task force of japanese gastric cancer association for research promotion evaluated the clinical impact of remnant gastric cancer by systematically reviewing publications focusing on molecular carcinogenesis, lymph node status, patient survival, and surgical complications. a systematic literature search was performed using pubmed/medline with the keywords ""remnant,"" ""stomach,"" and ""cancer,"" revealing 1154 relevant reports published up to the end of december 2014. the mean interval between the initial surgery and the diagnosis of remnant gastric cancer ranged from 10 to 30",remnant gastric really differ primary gastric systematic review literature task force japanese gastric association remnant gastric frequently define detect remnant stomach distal gastrectomy benign surgery gastric least year primary surgery often report poor prognosis task force japanese gastric association research promotion evaluate impact remnant gastric systematically review publication focus molecular carcinogenesis lymph node status survival surgical complication systematic literature search perform use medline keywords remnant stomach reveal relevant report publish end december mean interval initial surgery diagnosis remnant gastric range,d,Stomach Cancer

"Thyroid cancer incidence in cohorts exposed in childhood to 131I released during the Windscale nuclear reactor accident at Sellafield, England, in 1957. A fire in one of the Windscale nuclear reactors at Sellafield (Cumbria, England) in October 1957 released 1,800 TBq of <sup>131</sup>I (half-life, 8 days) to atmosphere. Measurements of <sup>131</sup>I activity in thyroids of exposed children showed typical thyroid doses of tens of milligray, but with some exceeding 100 mGy. Radiation exposure in childhood is known to increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Consequently, an investigation was conducted into whether raised numbers of thyroid cancer cases occurred in those exposed to <sup>131</sup>I as young children in Cumbria. A database of Cumbrian births from 1950 onwards allowed cohorts of 56,086 births during 1950-1958 and 137,444 births during 1959-1980 to be constructed, periods including children potentially exposed and unexposed, respectively, to <sup>131</sup>I. Three areas of Cumbria with different <sup>131</sup>I contamination levels were identified from monitoring data, and births assigned to these three areas for the two periods of birth. Members of these six sub-cohorts were linked to incident thyroid cancer cases in Great Britain during 1981-2020 using national cancer registration databases, providing thyroid cancer incidence rates. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with the lowest contamination area as a reference, were computed. No IRR differed discernibly from unity. For births during 1950-1958, the IRR for the combined highest and intermediate <sup>131</sup>I contamination areas was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 1.56), and no case of thyroid cancer was found in the small cohort born in the highest contamination area. In conclusion, no increased risk of thyroid cancer in those exposed to <sup>131</sup>I as young children in Cumbria in 1957 was detected. This study adds to the evidence on the long-term risk of thyroid cancer following childhood exposure to low and moderate levels of <sup>131</sup>I, such as occurred following the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011.","thyroid cancer incidence in cohorts exposed in childhood to 131i released during the windscale nuclear reactor accident at sellafield, england, in 1957. a fire in one of the windscale nuclear reactors at sellafield (cumbria, england) in october 1957 released 1,800 tbq of 131 i (half-life, 8 days) to atmosphere. measurements of 131 i activity in thyroids of exposed children showed typical thyroid doses of tens of milligray, but with some exceeding 100 mgy. radiation exposure in childhood is known to increase the risk of thyroid cancer. consequently, an investigation was conducted into whether raised numbers of thyroid cancer cases occurred in those exposed to 131 i as young children in cumbria. a database of cumbrian births from 1950 onwards allowed cohorts of 56,086 births during 1950-1958 and 137,444 births during 1959-1980 to be constructed, periods including children potentially exposed and unexposed, respectively, to 131 i. three areas of cumbria with",thyroid incidence cohort expose childhood release windscale nuclear reactor accident sellafield england fire one windscale nuclear reactor sellafield cumbria england october release tbq half life day atmosphere measurement activity thyroid exposed child show typical thyroid dos ten milligray exceed mgy radiation exposure childhood know increase risk thyroid consequently investigation conduct whether raised number thyroid occur expose young child cumbria database cumbrian birth onwards allow cohort birth birth construct period include child potentially expose unexposed respectively three area cumbria,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with newly evaluated papillary thyroid cancer Background: This study investigates whether diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of papillary thyroid cancer, using an age-, gender-, and race-matched analysis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 1559 patients with newly evaluated thyroid cancer over a 4-year period at our institution and identified 1313 patients (84%) with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Characteristics of patients with diabetes versus those without diabetes were compared with a chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for numeric variables. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma at our institution was compared (using an age-, gender-, and race-matched analysis) with that expected based on data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the same time period. Results: For patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the median age was 47 years; 74% were female; 83% were white; and the prevalence of diabetes was 8%.

"Redefining early gastric cancer. The problem is that current definitions of early gastric cancer allow the inclusion of regional lymph node metastases. The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. The aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in “early gastric cancer” to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. A systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library) was undertaken using a combination of text words “early gastric cancer”, “lymph node metastasis”, “factors”, “endoscopy”, “surgery”, “lymphadenectomy” “mucosa”, “submucosa”, “lymphovascular invasion”, “differentiated”, “undifferentiated” and “ulcer”. All available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. The initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Over time, the definition of early gastric cancer has broadened and the indications for endoscopic treatment have widened.

"Icaritin suppresses CAD-mediated liver cancer development by targeting miR-18b-5p in a xenograft mouse model. Cancer cells show abnormal nucleotide metabolism and prefer the de novo synthesis pathway. As the key enzymes, Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, Aspartate transcarbamoylase, and Dihydroorotase (CAD) is overactivated in cancer and promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis, supplying cancer cells with DNA and RNA biosynthesis precursors. Therefore, the development of drugs targeting CAD might inhibit cancer progression and transformation. Icaritin (ICT) is an isoprenoid flavonoid derivative with a wide range of anticancer activities, however, the mechanism of ICT in regulating pyrimidine biosynthesis in cancer remains unclear. MicroRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis by regulating the expression of target genes, and ICT has been shown to regulate the expression of miRNAs leading to suppressing cancer progression. Using both human normal hepatocytes and liver cancer cells, we found that CAD expression was significantly elevated in cancer cells. Interestingly, although ICT treatment reduced CAD protein levels in liver cancer cells, it increased CAD transcriptional activity. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed miR-18b-5p as a direct regulator of CAD. By transfecting miR-18b-5p mimics or inhibitors, we showed ICT upregulates miR-18b-5p to suppress CAD, inhibiting liver cancer cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Furthermore, in a human liver cancer xenograft mouse model, ICT treatment markedly reduced tumor growth and decreased Ki-67 expression, consistent with the in vitro results, CAD protein expression was downregulated, while its mRNA level was upregulated, further supporting a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Overall, ICT plays an anti-liver cancer role by increasing miR-18b-5p at the post-transcriptional level to inhibit CAD expression, which may interfere with the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine and development of liver cancer.","icaritin suppresses cad-mediated liver cancer development by targeting mir-18b-5p in a xenograft mouse model. cancer cells show abnormal nucleotide metabolism and prefer the de novo synthesis pathway. as the key enzymes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase (cad) is overactivated in cancer and promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis, supplying cancer cells with dna and rna biosynthesis precursors. therefore, the development of drugs targeting cad might inhibit cancer progression and transformation. icaritin (ict) is an isoprenoid flavonoid derivative with a wide range of anticancer activities, however, the mechanism of ict in regulating pyrimidine biosynthesis in cancer remains unclear. micrornas are involved in carcinogenesis by regulating the expression of target genes, and ict has been shown to regulate the expression of mirnas leading to suppressing cancer progression. using both human normal hepatocytes and liver cancer cells, we found that cad expression was significantly elevated in cancer cells. interestingly, although ict treatment",icaritin suppress cad mediate liver development target mir b p xenograft mouse model cell show abnormal nucleotide metabolism prefer de novo synthesis pathway key enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase aspartate transcarbamoylase dihydroorotase cad overactivated promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis supply cell dna rna biosynthesis precursor therefore development drug target cad might inhibit progression transformation icaritin ict isoprenoid flavonoid derivative wide range anticancer activity however mechanism ict regulate pyrimidine biosynthesis remain unclear micrornas involve carcinogenesis regulate expression target gene ict show regulate expression mirnas lead suppress progression use human normal hepatocytes liver cell find cad expression significantly elevate cell interestingly although ict,b,Liver Cancer
"LncGPR107 drives the self-renewal of liver tumor initiating cells and liver tumorigenesis through GPR107-dependent manner With self-renewal and differentiation properties, liver tumor initiating cells (TICs) are the reasons for tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance. G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are critical modulators in many physiological and pathological processes. While, their roles in liver TICs are unknown. An unbiased screening was performed using online-available data dataset. Liver TICs were sorted by FACS with surface marker CD133, or enriched by oncosphere formation. TIC self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. Loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncRNA. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, ChIP, western blot and double FISH were used explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA. We performed an unbiased screening for GPCR expression in liver cancers, and found GPR107 was the most highly expressed GPCR in liver cancer and liver TICs. GPR107 was essential for the self-renewal of liver TICs. The expression of GPR107 was regulated by a long noncoding RNA lncGPR107. LncGPR107 was also highly expressed in liver cancers and liver TICs. LncGPR107 drove the self-renewal of liver TICs through GPR107. Moreover, lncGPR107 recruited SRCAP complex to GPR107 promoter to drive its transcriptional activation. LncGPR107 depletion inhibited the binding of SRCAP complex and GPR107 promoter and subsequent GPR107 expression. Moreover, LncGPR107-SRCAP-GPR107 can be targeted for liver TIC elimination. GPR107 was the most highly expressed GPCR in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncGPR107 participated in the transcriptional regulation of GPR107 in cis, through recruiting SRCAP remodeling complex to GPR107 promoter.

"A cross-national perspective of migration and cancer: incidence of five major cancer types among resettlers from the former Soviet Union in Germany and ethnic Germans in Russia Few studies compared cancer incidence among migrants both to their host countries and to their population of origin. We aimed to compare cancer incidence of ethnic Germans who migrated from the former Soviet Union to Germany (resettlers) to those living in Russia as well as to the German and the Russian general populations. The cancer registry of North Rhine-Westphalia identified incident cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer in resettlers and the general population of the administrative district of Munster (Germany) between 2004 and 2013. The Tomsk cancer registry collected the same data in ethnic Germans and the general population of the Tomsk region (Russia). We used standardised incidence rate ratios (SIRs) to compare rates of resettlers and ethnic Germans with the respective general populations. The total number of person-years under risk was 83,289 for ethnic Germans, 8,006,775 for the population of Tomsk, 219,604 for resettlers, and 20,516,782 for the population of Munster. Incidence of the five investigated cancer types among ethnic Germans did not differ from incidence of the general population of Tomsk. Compared to the general population of Tomsk, incidence among resettlers was higher for colorectal cancer in both sexes (females: SIR 1.45 [95% CI 1.14–1.83], males: SIR 1.56 [95% CI 1.23–1.97]), breast cancer in females (SIR 1.65 [95% CI 1.40–1.95]), and prostate cancer (SIR 1.64 [95% CI 1.34–2.01]). Incidence rates of these cancer types among resettlers were more similar to rates of the general population of Munster. Incidence of stomach and lung cancer did not differ between resettlers and the general population of Tomsk. After an average stay of 15 years, we observed that incidence of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer among resettlers converged to levels of the general population of Munster. Resettler’s incidence of stomach and lung cancer, however, was comparable to incidence in their population of origin.

"PKM2 inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance to transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma Therapeutic options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an interventional procedure used to deliver chemotherapy and embolizing agents directly to the tumor and is the procedure of choice for patients with intermediate stage HCC. While effective, more than 40% of patients do not respond to therapy, highlighting the need to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance. We sought to evaluate mechanisms of TACE resistance and evaluate a potential therapeutic target to overcome this resistance. Using a prognostic gene signature which predicts TACE response (TACE Navigator) in a cohort of HCC patients who received TACE, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Transcriptomic and gene pathway analysis were used to identify potential drivers of TACE resistance. Knockdown of the gene encoding rate limiting enzyme PKM2 using shRNA in HCC cell lines, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of PKM2 with shikonin using an in vitro TACE model measured response to chemotherapy under hypoxia. Finally, we replicated the TACE model with shikonin using patient derived cell line organoids (PDC). Functional studies were performed in vitro using immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, glycolysis and hypoxia assays. In patient non-responders, we identified enrichment of the glycolysis pathway, specifically of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. We identified four HCC cell lines which recapitulated a TACE responder-like and non-responder-like phenotype. PKM2 knockdown in HCC cell lines demonstrated a less proliferative and aggressive phenotype as well as improved drug sensitivity to both doxorubicin and cisplatin. In vitro TACE model demonstrated that TACE non-responder-like cells overcame therapeutic resistance and rendered them susceptible to therapy through PKM2 knockdown. Lastly, we obtained similar results using a pharmacologic PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin in both cell lines, and PDC organoids. Elevated PKM2 is associated with treatment resistance and abbreviated survival in patients receiving TACE. Elevated PKM2 in vitro is associated with increased utilization of the glycolysis pathway, resulting in oxygen independent cell metabolism. Through PKM2 knockdown as well as with pharmacologic inhibition with shikonin, non-responder cells can be reprogrammed to act as responders and could improve TACE efficacy in patients.","pkm2 inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance to transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) are limited. transarterial chemoembolization (tace) is an interventional procedure used to deliver chemotherapy and embolizing agents directly to the tumor and is the procedure of choice for patients with intermediate stage hcc. while effective, more than 40% of patients do not respond to therapy, highlighting the need to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance. we sought to evaluate mechanisms of tace resistance and evaluate a potential therapeutic target to overcome this resistance. using a prognostic gene signature which predicts tace response (tace navigator) in a cohort of hcc patients who received tace, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. transcriptomic and gene pathway analysis were used to identify potential drivers of tace resistance. knockdown of the gene encoding rate limiting enzyme pkm2 using shrna in hcc cell lines, as well as",pkm inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance transarterial chemoembolization hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic option hepatocellular carcinoma hcc limit transarterial chemoembolization tace interventional procedure use deliver chemotherapy embolizing agent directly procedure choice intermediate stage hcc effective respond therapy highlight need investigate possible mechanism resistance seek evaluate mechanism tace resistance evaluate potential therapeutic target overcome resistance use prognostic gene signature predict tace response tace navigator cohort hcc receive tace classify responder non responder transcriptomic gene pathway use identify potential driver tace resistance knockdown gene encode rate limit enzyme pkm use shrna hcc cell line well,b,Liver Cancer

"NK-cell-dependent killing of colon carcinoma cells is mediated by natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and stimulated by parvovirus infection of target cells Investigating how the immune system functions during malignancies is crucial to developing novel therapeutic strategies. Natural killer (NK) cells, an important component of the innate immune system, play a vital role in immune defense against tumors and virus-infected cells. The poor survival rate in colon cancer makes it particularly important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Oncolytic viruses, in addition to lysing tumor cells, may have the potential to augment antitumor immune responses. In the present study, we investigate the role of NK cells and how parvovirus H-1PV can modulate NK-cell mediated immune responses against colon carcinoma. Human NK cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors. The cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated inhibition of NK cells were measured in chromium release assays. Phenotypic assessment of colon cancer and dendritic cells was done by FACS. The statistical significance of the results was calculated with Student’s t test (*p <0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). We show that IL-2-activated human NK cells can effectively kill colon carcinoma cells. Killing of colon carcinoma cells by NK cells was further enhanced upon infection of the former cells with parvovirus H-1PV. H-1PV has potent oncolytic activity against various tumors, yet its direct killing effect on colon carcinoma cells is limited. The cytotoxicity of NK cells towards colon carcinoma cells, both mock- and H-1PV-infected, was found to be mostly mediated by a combination of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), namely NKp30, 44, and 46. Colon carcinoma cells displayed low to moderate expression of NK cell ligands, and this expression was modulated upon H-1PV infection. Lysates of H-1PV-infected colon carcinoma cells were found to increase MHC class II expression on dendritic cells. Altogether, these data suggest that IL-2-activated NK cells actively kill colon carcinoma cells and that this killing is mediated by several natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) in combination. Additionally, in association with parvovirus H-1PV, IL-2-activated NK cells have the potential to boost immune responses against colon cancer.","nk-cell-dependent killing of colon carcinoma cells is mediated by natural cytotoxicity receptors (ncrs) and stimulated by parvovirus infection of target cells investigating how the immune system functions during malignancies is crucial to developing novel therapeutic strategies. natural killer (nk) cells, an important component of the innate immune system, play a vital role in immune defense against tumors and virus-infected cells. the poor survival rate in colon cancer makes it particularly important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. oncolytic viruses, in addition to lysing tumor cells, may have the potential to augment antitumor immune responses. in the present study, we investigate the role of nk cells and how parvovirus h-1pv can modulate nk-cell mediated immune responses against colon carcinoma. human nk cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors. the cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated inhibition of nk cells were measured in chromium release assays. phenotypic assessment of colon cancer and dendritic cells",nk cell dependent killing colon carcinoma cell mediate natural cytotoxicity receptor ncrs stimulate parvovirus infection target cell investigate immune system function malignancy crucial develop novel therapeutic strategy natural killer nk cell important component innate immune system play vital role immune defense virus infected cell poor survival rate colon make particularly important develop novel therapeutic strategy oncolytic virus addition lysing cell may potential augment antitumor immune response present investigate role nk cell parvovirus h pv modulate nk cell mediate immune response colon carcinoma human nk cell isolate blood healthy donor cytotoxicity antibody mediated inhibition nk cell measure chromium release assay phenotypic assessment colon dendritic cell,a,Colon Cancer

"Overexpression of protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 facilitates tumor growth and indicates unfavorable prognosis of patients with colon cancer. Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) has been reported to play important role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. However, its role in colon cancer has not been studied. Here, we aimed to investigate the biological functions and potential mechanism of PRC1 in colon cancer. The expression level of PRC1 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a tissue microarray (TMA). Furthermore, colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480 were treated with short hairpin RNAs against PRC1. The biological function of PRC1 was determined by MTT proliferation, colony formation assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. Then, an in vivo tumor formation assay was conducted to explore the effects of PRC1 on tumor growth. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PRC1 were highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. PRC1 expression was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival of patients with colon cancer. Knockdown of PRC1 could decrease proliferation and colony forming ability of colon cancer cells, as well as arrested more cells at G2/M phase and promoted cell apoptosis. In cancer cells, the expression pattern of protein regulators included in cell cycle and apoptosis progress were reverted by PRC1 down-regulation. Additionally, PRC1 down-regulation could suppress colon tumor growth and differentiation. We confirmed that PRC1 was overexpressed in colon cancer and was associated with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients. PRC1 down-regulation could arrest cell cycle at G2/M stage, inhibit proliferation, and elicit apoptosis. These findings showed the potential of PRC1 to be used for therapeutic approaches in colon cancer.","overexpression of protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 facilitates tumor growth and indicates unfavorable prognosis of patients with colon cancer. protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (prc1) has been reported to play important role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. however, its role in colon cancer has not been studied. here, we aimed to investigate the biological functions and potential mechanism of prc1 in colon cancer. the expression level of prc1 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr), western blotting, and immunohistochemical (ihc) staining of a tissue microarray (tma). furthermore, colon cancer cell lines hct116 and sw480 were treated with short hairpin rnas against prc1. the biological function of prc1 was determined by mtt proliferation, colony formation assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. then, an in vivo tumor formation assay was conducted to explore the effects of prc1 on tumor growth. the mrna",overexpression protein regulator cytokinesis facilitates growth indicate unfavorable prognosis colon protein regulator cytokinesis prc report play important role pathogenesis various however role colon investigate biological function potential mechanism prc colon expression level prc colon tissue cell line detect quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr western blotting immunohistochemical ihc staining tissue microarray tma furthermore colon cell line hct sw treat short hairpin rna prc biological function prc determine mtt proliferation colony formation assay cell cycle apoptosis assay vivo formation assay conduct explore effect prc growth mrna,a,Colon Cancer
"PD-L1 expression in liver metastasis: its clinical significance and discordance with primary tumor in colorectal cancer The outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients with liver metastases are poor, which may be related to a different tumor microenvironment in liver metastases from primary tumors. This study was aimed to analyze PD-L1 expression and the immune microenvironment status in liver metastases and compare the differences of PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and liver metastases of colorectal cancer. 74 cases of pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer with liver metastasis underwent resection from our hospital were included. Tissue microarrays were used for the interpretation of PD-L1 expression, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and CD8 density by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the disparity between primary tumor and liver metastasis in PD-L1 expression, CD4 and CD8 density and analyzed the factors associated with obvious PD-L1 disparity. The expression of PD-L1 was positively related to the density of CD4 and CD8 in liver metastases. The expression of PD-L1 in liver metastases was higher than in primary tumors in certain subgroups, including patients with concurrent liver metastases (n = 63, p = 0.05), patients receiving concurrent resection of primary and metastatic tumors (n = 56, p = 0.04). The two subgroups generally reflected those without inconsistent external influences, such as treatment and temporal factors, between primary tumors and liver metastases. In these subgroups, the intrinsic differences of microenvironment between primary tumors and liver metastases could be identified.

"Expression of the NEK family in normal and cancer tissue: an immunohistochemical study. The NEK serine/threonine protein kinases are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Alterations in these pathways are frequently associated with cell malignant cellular transformations. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour in the endocrine system. Despite good treatment methods, the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy. The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue. We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis. NEK3 expression was stronger in patients with stage II, that involved metastasis. NEK5, on the other hand, showed high expression in patients with invasion and metastasis and in patients with tumour size > 4 cm. Furthermore, this work, demonstrated for the first time a high specificity and sensitivity of over-expression of NEK1 in classical and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer and NEK3 in tall-cell papillary thyroid cancer. Taken together, the NEK protein kinases emerge as important proteins in thyroid cancer development and may help to identify malignancy and aggressiveness features during diagnosis.

"Performance of claims-based algorithms for identifying incident thyroid cancer in commercial health plan enrollees receiving antidiabetic drug therapies Abstract Background Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing in the United States (US) and many other countries. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate algorithms using administrative medical claims data for identification of incident thyroid cancer. Methods This effort was part of a prospective cohort study of adults initiating therapy on antidiabetic drugs and used administrative data from a large commercial health insurer in the US. Patients had at least 6 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiation during 2009–2013, with follow-up through March, 2014 or until disenrollment. Potential incident thyroid cancers were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code 193 (malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland). Medical records were adjudicated by a thyroid cancer specialist. Several clinical variables (e.g., hospitalization, treatments) were considered as predictors of case status. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the performance of two primary algorithms. Results Charts were requested for 170 patients, 150 (88%) were received and 141 (80%) had sufficient information to adjudicate. Of the 141 potential cases identified using ≥1 ICD-9 diagnosis code 193, 72 were confirmed as incident thyroid cancer (PPV of 51% (95% CI 43–60%)). Adding the requirement for thyroid surgery increased the PPV to 68% (95% CI 58-77%); including the presence of other therapies (chemotherapy, radio-iodine therapy) had no impact. When cases were required to have thyroid surgery during follow-up and ≥2 ICD-9 193 codes within 90 days of this surgery, the PPV was 91% (95% CI 81-96%); 62 (82%) of the true cases were identified and 63 (91%) of the non-cases were removed from consideration by the algorithm as potential cases. Conclusions These findings suggest a significant degree of misclassification results from relying only on ICD-9 diagnosis codes to detect thyroid cancer. An administrative claims-based algorithm was developed that performed well to identify true incident thyroid cancer cases.","performance of claims-based algorithms for identifying incident thyroid cancer in commercial health plan enrollees receiving antidiabetic drug therapies abstract background thyroid cancer incidence is increasing in the united states (us) and many other countries. the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate algorithms using administrative medical claims data for identification of incident thyroid cancer. methods this effort was part of a prospective cohort study of adults initiating therapy on antidiabetic drugs and used administrative data from a large commercial health insurer in the us. patients had at least 6 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiation during 2009–2013, with follow-up through march, 2014 or until disenrollment. potential incident thyroid cancers were identified using international classification of diseases, 9 th revision (icd-9) diagnosis code 193 (malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland). medical records were adjudicated by a thyroid cancer specialist. several clinical variables (e.g., hospitalization, treatments) were considered as",performance claim base algorithm identify incident thyroid commercial health plan enrollees receive antidiabetic drug therapy abstract thyroid incidence increase united state u many country develop evaluate algorithm use administrative medical claim data identification incident thyroid method effort part prospective cohort adult initiate therapy antidiabetic drug use administrative data large commercial health insurer u least month continuous enrollment prior initiation follow march disenrollment potential incident thyroid identify use international classification th revision icd diagnosis code malignant neoplasm thyroid gland medical record adjudicate thyroid specialist several variable e g hospitalization consider,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Differential responses of scirrhous and well-differentiated gastric cancer cells to orthotopic fibroblasts. Scirrhous gastric cancer cells proliferate rapidly with fibrosis, when the cancer cells invade into the submucosa of the stomach. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the rapid proliferation, the growth interaction between gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts was examined. Human gastric cancer cell lines established from scirrhous carcinoma or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma were used. Human fibroblast cell lines were obtained from various organs. The growth interaction between gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts was examined by calculating the number of cancer cells or by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation of cancer cells. Gastric fibroblasts specifically stimulated the growth of scirrhous gastric cancer cells, but not that of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells. The growth factor(s) produced from gastric fibroblasts were then partially purified and characterised. The growth-promoting factor(s) had apparent molecular weights of 10000 dalton and was sensitive both to heat and proteinase treatment. No inhibition for the factor(s) was achieved with defined anti-growth factor antibodies. In this study, differential responses of scirrhous and well-differentiated gastric cancer cells to orthotopic fibroblasts were shown. Rapid proliferation of scirrhous gastric carcinoma should be partly controlled by orthotopic fibroblasts.

"Alcohol consumption and liver cancer risk: a meta-analysis Alcohol is a confirmed risk factor of liver cancer. Yet, its dose–response function and synergistic effects with other risk factors remain unclear. We performed a meta-analysis on publications up to May 2014. A total of 112 publications were identified. The meta-relative risk (mRR) and the dose–response trend were calculated. Tests for heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were performed. The synergy index (SI) was recorded or calculated, whenever possible. Compared to individuals who never drank or drank at very low frequencies, the mRR for ever drinkers was 1.29 (95 % confidence interval, CI 1.16–1.42) and 1.46 (95 % CI 1.27–1.65) for case–control studies, and 1.07 (95 % CI 0.87–1.27) for cohort studies. Being a current drinker was associated with an increased liver cancer risk in case–control studies (mRR = 1.55, 95 % CI 0.38–2.73), but not in cohort studies (mRR = 0.86, 95 % CI 0.74–0.97). The dose–response relation between alcohol and liver cancer was apparent with RR = 1.08 (95 % CI 1.04–1.11) for 12 g/day (~1 drink), 1.54 (95 % CI 1.36–1.74) for 50 g/day, 2.14 (95 % CI 1.74–2.62) for 75 g/day, 3.21 (95 % CI 2.34–4.40) for 100 g/day, and 5.20 (95 % CI 3.25–8.29) for 125 g/day of alcohol consumption. There were synergistic effects of alcohol consumption with hepatitis (S = 2.14, 95 % CI 1.31–2.98) and with diabetes (S = 3.57, 95 % CI 2.29–4.84) on the risk of liver cancer, although this may be subject to publication bias. Overall, one alcoholic drink per day (~12 g/day) may be associated with a 1.1 times higher liver cancer risk.

"Meeting report of the 73rd Japanese gastric cancer congress. surgical techniques. In this session, reconstruction methods after gastrectomy were discussed. K. Nakamura, Tokai University, evaluated the survival rates in patients who had undergone various reconstructive procedures after distal and total gastrectomy. They reported that higher 5-year survival rates were observed in patients who had undergone gastroduodenostomy and jejunal interposition, allowing food to pass through the duodenum, than in those who had undergone gastro-or esophagojejunostomy. They suggested that reconstruction enabling food to pass through the duodenum should be performed irrespective of the disease stage. Y. Nakane, Kansai Medical University, reported that reconstruction with a jejunal pouch after total gastrectomy was effective in the prevention of the small stomach syndrome, but that long-term emptying disorders were observed in some patients after Roux-en-Y anastomosis with a jejunal pouch. H. Kashimura, Jikei University, reported that the ileocolon interposition was superior to the Roux-en-Y method after total gastrectomy because less reflux esophagitis and more food intake occurred at each meal. K. Yamaguchi, Sapporo Medical University, evaluated jejunal pouch interposition after proximal gastrectomy both clinically and experimentally. They performed jejunal pouch interposition or esophagogastrostomy in beagles and showed that the former was superior to the latter in terms of changes in gastrointestinal hormones, maintenance of body weight, and emptying of the residual stomach. They concluded that jejunal pouch interposition should be considered after proximal gastrectomy. S. Kinami, Kanazawa University, evaluated jejunal pouch interposition after distal gastrectomy.

"Epidemiological evidence for a link between postpartum thyroiditis and thyroid cancer.

Similarly highrelative frequency and incidence rates of the diseaseamong women have also been reported from severalother countries in the Gulf region (Oman, Qatar,Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). It isnoteworthy that these countries also have high birthand total fertility rates (about 5–6 children/woman).Other reproductive health patterns in these countriesinclude high prevalence of consanguinity, youngage at marriage and childbearing, short birth inter-vals, and older ages at last birth [2]. All these factorsresult in a relatively long and eventful reproductivelife.Within this setting, we conducted a population-based case–control study among 238 women withthyroid cancer and a similar number of individuallymatched controls in Kuwait [3]. Among the repro-ductive factors, we found that women who hadexperienced episodes of postpartum thyroiditis (18cases, 2 controls) were at a signiﬁcantly increased riskof developing thyroid cancer (odds ratio: 10.2; 95%CI: 2.3–44.8); and the women who had experiencedthe condition had no previous thyroid disease orX-ray exposure to the neck.

"MASTL induces Colon Cancer progression and Chemoresistance by promoting Wnt/β-catenin signaling Chemotherapeutic agents that modulate cell cycle checkpoints and/or tumor-specific pathways have shown immense promise in preclinical and clinical studies aimed at anti-cancer therapy. MASTL (Greatwall in Xenopus and Drosophila), a serine/threonine kinase controls the final G2/M checkpoint and prevents premature entry of cells into mitosis. Recent studies suggest that MASTL expression is highly upregulated in cancer and confers resistance against chemotherapy. However, the role and mechanism/s of MASTL mediated regulation of tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We utilized a large patient cohort and mouse models of colon cancer as well as colon cancer cells to determine the role of Mastl and associated mechanism in colon cancer. Here, we show that MASTL expression increases in colon cancer across all cancer stages compared with normal colon tissue (P < 0.001). Also, increased levels of MASTL associated with high-risk of the disease and poor prognosis. Further, the shRNA silencing of MASTL expression in colon cancer cells induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and inhibited xenograft-tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic analysis revealed that MASTL expression facilitates colon cancer progression by promoting the β-catenin/Wnt signaling, the key signaling pathway implicated in colon carcinogenesis, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and Survivin. Further studies where colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were subjected to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) treatment revealed a sharp increase in MASTL expression upon chemotherapy, along with increases in Bcl-xL and Survivin expression. Most notably, inhibition of MASTL in these cells induced chemosensitivity to 5FU with downregulation of Survivin and Bcl-xL expression. Overall, our data shed light on the heretofore-undescribed mechanistic role of MASTL in key oncogenic signaling pathway/s to regulate colon cancer progression and chemo-resistance that would tremendously help to overcome drug resistance in colon cancer treatment.","mastl induces colon cancer progression and chemoresistance by promoting wnt/β-catenin signaling chemotherapeutic agents that modulate cell cycle checkpoints and/or tumor-specific pathways have shown immense promise in preclinical and clinical studies aimed at anti-cancer therapy. mastl (greatwall in xenopus and drosophila), a serine/threonine kinase controls the final g2/m checkpoint and prevents premature entry of cells into mitosis. recent studies suggest that mastl expression is highly upregulated in cancer and confers resistance against chemotherapy. however, the role and mechanism/s of mastl mediated regulation of tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. we utilized a large patient cohort and mouse models of colon cancer as well as colon cancer cells to determine the role of mastl and associated mechanism in colon cancer. here, we show that mastl expression increases in colon cancer across all cancer stages compared with normal colon tissue (p < 0.001). also, increased levels of mastl associated with high-risk of the disease and",mastl induces colon progression chemoresistance promote wnt catenin signal chemotherapeutic agent modulate cell cycle checkpoint specific pathway show immense promise preclinical anti therapy mastl greatwall xenopus drosophila serine threonine kinase control final g checkpoint prevents premature entry cell mitosis recent suggest mastl expression highly upregulated confers resistance chemotherapy however role mechanism mastl mediate regulation tumorigenesis remain poorly understood utilize large cohort mouse model colon well colon cell determine role mastl associate mechanism colon show mastl expression increase colon across stage compare normal colon tissue p also increase level mastl associate high risk,a,Colon Cancer

"Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. By use of the postcoded database held by the Small Area Health Statistic Unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain was examined from 1974-86 (England), 1974-84 (Wales) and 1975-87 (Scotland). Numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. Observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. The study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. Over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (P<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Among these cancers in the second stage, the excess from 0 to 1 km ranged from 37% for liver cancer (0.95) excess cases 10(-5) per year to 5% for colorectal cancer. There was evidence of residual confounding near the incinerators, which seems to be a likely explanation of the finding for all cancers, stomach and lung, and also to explain at least part of the excess of liver cancer. For this reason and because of a substantial level of misdiagnosis (mainly secondary tumours) found among registrations and death certificates for liver cancer, further investigation, including histological review of the cases, is to be done to help determine whether or not there is an increase in primary liver cancer in the vicinity of incinerators.","cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in great britain. by use of the postcoded database held by the small area health statistic unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in great britain was examined from 1974-86 (england), 1974-84 (wales) and 1975-87 (scotland). numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. the study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (p<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. among these cancers in the",incidence near municipal solid waste incinerator great britain use postcoded database hold small area health statistic unit incidence million people live near municipal solid waste incinerator great britain examine england wale scotland number observed compare expect number calculate national rate regionally adjust stratification deprivation index base census small area statistic observe expected ratio test decline risk distance km conduct two stage first involve stratified random sample incinerator second remain incinerator two stage statistically significant p decline risk distance incinerator combine stomach colorectal liver lung among,d,Stomach Cancer
"Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with malignant disease: report of two cases and a review of the literature Two cases of inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the liver associated with gastrointestinal tract cancer are reported. In addition, the etiological correlation between IPT and abscesses of the liver in cancer patients is discussed. The first patient was a 63-year-old woman who underwent distal gastrectomy and partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of stomach cancer with liver metastasis. The second patient was a 66-year-old man who had undergone surgery for rectal cancer 6 years previously and underwent partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of metastasis of rectal cancer to the liver. The gastric cancer was a papillary adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa, and the rectal cancer was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma limited to the subserosa. The resected liver tumor in the first case measured 5.5×5.0×4.0 cm and was 2.5×1.9×1.6 cm in the second. The cut surface showed that both masses were well circumscribed and divided into lobules by fibrous tissue. They were yellowish white in color and there was no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage. Histologically the masses consisted of fibrous areas and cellular areas, and the cellular areas consisted of fascicles of plump spindle cells mingled with varying numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. The masses were diagnosed as IPTs. Obliterating phlebitis suggesting infection via the portal vein was seen in the adjacent liver tissue in both cases. According to previous cases reported in the literature, there are three types of cancers associated with hepatic IPT: gastrointestinal tract cancer, biliary tract cancer, and cancers that need strong systemic chemotherapy. The underlying cancer types of IPT of the liver are almost similar to those associated with pyogenic liver abscesses suggesting the etiological correlation between IPT and abscesses of the liver.","inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with malignant disease: report of two cases and a review of the literature two cases of inflammatory pseudotumor (ipt) of the liver associated with gastrointestinal tract cancer are reported. in addition, the etiological correlation between ipt and abscesses of the liver in cancer patients is discussed. the first patient was a 63-year-old woman who underwent distal gastrectomy and partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of stomach cancer with liver metastasis. the second patient was a 66-year-old man who had undergone surgery for rectal cancer 6 years previously and underwent partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of metastasis of rectal cancer to the liver. the gastric cancer was a papillary adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa, and the rectal cancer was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma limited to the subserosa. the resected liver tumor in the first case measured 5.5×5.0×4.0 cm and was 2.5×1.9×1.6 cm in the second. the",inflammatory pseudotumor liver associate malignant report two review literature two inflammatory pseudotumor ipt liver associate gastrointestinal tract report addition etiological correlation ipt abscess liver discuss first year old woman underwent distal gastrectomy partial hepatectomy diagnosis stomach liver metastasis second year old man undergone surgery rectal year previously underwent partial hepatectomy diagnosis metastasis rectal liver gastric papillary adenocarcinoma limit mucosa rectal moderately differentiate adenocarcinoma limit subserosa resect liver first measure cm cm second,b,Liver Cancer
"Effects of initial disease status on lymph flow following gastrectomy in cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach. In cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach (CRS), the lymphatic flow may be altered by the initial surgery. In this study of CRS after gastrectomy, we investigated how the regions of lymph node metastasis and changes in lymphatic flow depend on initial disease status. The study included 76 patients with CRS who underwent gastrectomy between September 2002 and November 2014. We analyzed and compared the clinicopathological factors and survival periods between patients after distal gastrectomy for malignant disease (group M, 33 patients) and patients after distal gastrectomy for benign disease (group B, 43 patients). The depth of tumor invasion was more advanced in group B (T1/T2/T3/T4: group M 18/1/7/7, group B 8/11/8/16; P = 0.002). However, the degree of lymph node metastasis did not differ significantly between the two groups.

"Deltopectoral flap revisited for reconstruction surgery in patients with advanced thyroid cancer: a case report We present the cases of 2 patients with invasive thyroid cancer, who underwent reconstructive surgery using a deltopectoral flap. Although the overall rate of extrathyroidal extension in patients with thyroid cancer is quite low, skin invasion is the most common pattern observed. Reconstructive surgery, involving local skin flaps, is required in these patients. The deltopectoral flap relies on the blood supply from intercostal perforators of the internal thoracic artery and usually requires skin grafting to the donor site. The internal thoracic artery is rarely sacrificed in these cases, even in an advanced surgery such as in patients with invasive thyroid cancer. A 55-year-old man with a distended thyroid gland presented to our hospital. He underwent advanced surgery, including skin excision, because we suspected that his tumor was thyroid cancer. The defect was covered with an ipsilateral deltopectoral flap via transposition of the flap, without skin grafting. In the second case, a 67-year-old woman with thyroid cancer that metastasized to her neck lymph nodes presented to our institution. Although the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery was sacrificed near its origin during tumor resection, the deltopectoral flap was raised in the usual manner without any complications. The skin defect caused by the tumor resection was covered with the flap. The patient had an uneventful clinical course for more than 2 years of follow-up. These 2 cases show the effectiveness of using the deltopectoral flap as a reconstructive option for patients with thyroid cancer who underwent radical surgery, resulting in a skin defect. The first case shows that this flap does not always require skin grafting to the donor site. To our knowledge, the second case may be the first report of a deltopectoral flap that was safely raised and applied with resection of the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery. Although thyroid cancer surgery with surrounding skin excision is a rare procedure, we found that the deltopectoral flap was useful and should be the first choice for patients undergoing reconstructive surgery, whether the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery is sacrificed.","deltopectoral flap revisited for reconstruction surgery in patients with advanced thyroid cancer: a case report we present the cases of 2 patients with invasive thyroid cancer, who underwent reconstructive surgery using a deltopectoral flap. although the overall rate of extrathyroidal extension in patients with thyroid cancer is quite low, skin invasion is the most common pattern observed. reconstructive surgery, involving local skin flaps, is required in these patients. the deltopectoral flap relies on the blood supply from intercostal perforators of the internal thoracic artery and usually requires skin grafting to the donor site. the internal thoracic artery is rarely sacrificed in these cases, even in an advanced surgery such as in patients with invasive thyroid cancer. a 55-year-old man with a distended thyroid gland presented to our hospital. he underwent advanced surgery, including skin excision, because we suspected that his tumor was thyroid cancer. the defect was covered with an",deltopectoral flap revisit reconstruction surgery advanced thyroid report present invasive thyroid undergo reconstructive surgery use deltopectoral flap although overall rate extrathyroidal extension thyroid quite low skin invasion common pattern observe reconstructive surgery involve local skin flap require deltopectoral flap relies blood supply intercostal perforators internal thoracic artery usually require skin graft donor site internal thoracic artery rarely sacrifice even advanced surgery invasive thyroid year old man distended thyroid gland present hospital undergo advanced surgery include skin excision suspect thyroid defect cover,e,Thyroid Cancer
"The risk of a second primary lung cancer after a first invasive breast cancer according to estrogen receptor status. Lung cancers account for 5 % of second primary cancers after breast cancer. The low overall 5-year relative survival rate of lung cancer makes it a particularly concerning new malignancy for breast cancer survivors. It is unknown whether second lung cancer risk varies by estrogen receptor (ER) expression of the first breast cancer. We evaluated second primary lung cancer risks using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)) among 222,148 one-year breast cancer survivors in the NCI-SEER Program registry database (1992–2008). Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % CIs for lung cancer following ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer were estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for age, year, and stage of breast cancer diagnosis, attained age, latency, and radiotherapy. We also examined the reciprocal association of second ER− and ER+ breast cancers among 28,107 1-year lung cancer survivors. There were 418 and 1,444 second lung cancers diagnosed following 50,781 ER− and 171,367 ER+ breast cancers. Second lung cancer rates were significantly elevated after ER− (SIR = 1.20 (1.09–1.33)), but not ER+ (SIR = 0.96 (0.91–1.01)) breast cancer. The adjusted RR for a second lung cancer following ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer was 1.22 (1.10–1.37). The reciprocal adjusted RR for a second ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer following lung cancer was 1.29 (0.98–1.70). The parallel increase for a second lung cancer following an ER− first breast cancer and for a second ER− breast cancer after a first lung cancer suggests that there may be shared etiologic factors for these cancers. Further evaluation of lung cancer risk after ER− breast cancer may identify women at high risk for this fatal malignancy.","the risk of a second primary lung cancer after a first invasive breast cancer according to estrogen receptor status. lung cancers account for 5 % of second primary cancers after breast cancer. the low overall 5-year relative survival rate of lung cancer makes it a particularly concerning new malignancy for breast cancer survivors. it is unknown whether second lung cancer risk varies by estrogen receptor (er) expression of the first breast cancer. we evaluated second primary lung cancer risks using standardized incidence ratios (sirs) (95 % confidence intervals (cis)) among 222,148 one-year breast cancer survivors in the nci-seer program registry database (1992–2008). relative risks (rrs) and 95 % cis for lung cancer following er− compared with er+ breast cancer were estimated using poisson regression, adjusted for age, year, and stage of breast cancer diagnosis, attained age, latency, and radiotherapy. we also examined the reciprocal association of second er− and er+",risk second primary lung first invasive breast accord estrogen receptor status lung account second primary breast low overall year relative survival rate lung make particularly concern new malignancy breast survivor unknown whether second lung risk varies estrogen receptor er expression first breast evaluate second primary lung risk use standardized incidence ratio sirs confidence interval cis among one year breast survivor nci seer program registry database relative risk rrs ci lung follow er compare er breast estimate use poisson regression adjust age year stage breast diagnosis attain age latency radiotherapy also examine reciprocal association second er er,c,Lung Cancer
"Compromised Outcome of Papillary Thyroid Cancer at Low-Volume Treatment Centers: Practice Makes Perfect? The intimate relationship between volume and outcome for nearly every major type of surgery is ubiquitous. Highvolume hospital care is associated with significantly lower mortality rates compared to low-volume hospitals. The effect of high surgeon volume accounts for the majority of the effect of high hospital volume in complex procedures. Nobel laureate and masterful Swiss surgeon Emil Theodor Kocher recognized the importance of surgical volume in improving outcomes in thyroid surgery. Kocher reported an operative mortality rate of 13 % for his first 100 thyroid procedures. By 1912, Kocher was able to reduce his mortality rate of thyroidectomy to less than 0.5 % after performing over 5000 thyroid excisions. He demonstrated a significant reduction in operative mortality with increasing experience. In the modern era, the association recognized by Kocher between provider volume and improved patient outcome has persisted. Reames et al. demonstrated that higher-volume hospitals had significantly lower mortality rates compared to lower-volume hospitals for eight different complex procedures in over 3 million patients. Data also show a significant relationship between surgeon volume and surgical morbidity in thyroid operations. Although the majority of thyroid operations are still performed by lowvolume surgeons, national trends in thyroid surgery over the last two decades exhibit an increase in thyroid surgical procedures performed by high-volume surgeons with a decrease in the incidence of complications, specifically recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypocalcemia. In addition, high-volume surgeons were more likely to perform total thyroidectomy and neck dissection as compared to low-volume surgeons. Hauch et al. evaluated the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003–2009) of all adult patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and unilateral thyroidectomy. They found that total thyroidectomy was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications compared to unilateral thyroidectomy in both lowand high-volume surgeons; however, higher surgeon volume was associated with improved patient outcome. Mitchell et al. demonstrated that operations for thyroid cancer led to avoidable reoperations more frequently if performed at low-volume centers. The initial operations requiring avoidable reoperations included errors in judgment concerning lymph node dissection or technical errors in incomplete thyroid resection. Furthermore, Schneider and colleagues found that higher-volume surgeons had better oncologic outcomes for thyroid cancer. In this issue, Youngwirth et al. report the first study examining margin status after total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer in the National Cancer Data Base (1998–2006). A total of 31,129 adult patients with thyroid cancer met the inclusion criterion of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. By multivariable analysis, the authors identified specific factors for patients with papillary thyroid cancer undergoing total thyroidectomy that led to a poor outcome in survival. These factors included patient factors (male gender, advanced age, African American race), socioeconomic factors (low income, government insurance), cancer stage (large tumor size, positive lymph nodes, distant metastases), absence of radioactive iodine treatment, and microscopically and macroscopically positive surgical margin status. Of these independent factors, which compromised patient survival, the authors recognized that only surgical margin status could be potentially controlled. They evaluated the factors associated with positive margin status in patients undergoing surgical resection for thyroid cancer.

"LncHOXA10 drives liver TICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis via HOXA10 transcription activation. Liver cancer is one of the most deadly cancers in the world. There are various cells in liver tumor bulk, including liver tumor initiating cells (TICs), which account for liver tumorigenesis, drug resistance, relapse and metastasis. The homeobox (HOX) transcription factors play critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, while, their roles in liver TICs and liver tumorigenesis remain unknown. An unbiased screening was performed using online-available datasets. Liver TICs were sorted by FACS using surface markers CD133, CD13 and EPCAM, or enriched by oncosphere formation assay. TIC self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. Loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncRNA. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, ChIP, Western blot and double FISH were used to explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA. Here, we examined the expression pattern of HOX transcription factors, and found HOXA10 was overexpressed in liver cancer samples. Moreover, a divergent lncRNA of HOXA10 (termed lncHOXA10 hereafter) was also highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncHOXA10 drove liver TIC self-renewal and liver tumorigenesis through HOXA10-dependent manner. LncHOXA10 interacted with SNF2L and recruited NURF chromatin remodeling complex to HOXA10 promoter, and thus initiated the transcription of HOXA10. Through HOXA10 transcriptional regulation, lncHOXA10 activated HOXA10 in liver TICs. LncHOXA10-HOXA10 signaling can be targeted to eliminate liver TICs. Altogether, lncHOXA10 drove HOXA10 expression and thus promoted liver TIC self-renewal. HOXA10 was the most highly expressed HOX transcription factor in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncHOXA10 drove the transcriptional activation of HOXA10. This work revealed the important role of HOX transcription factor in liver TIC self-renewal and added a new layer for liver TIC regulation.","lnchoxa10 drives liver tics self-renewal and tumorigenesis via hoxa10 transcription activation. liver cancer is one of the most deadly cancers in the world. there are various cells in liver tumor bulk, including liver tumor initiating cells (tics), which account for liver tumorigenesis, drug resistance, relapse and metastasis. the homeobox (hox) transcription factors play critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, while, their roles in liver tics and liver tumorigenesis remain unknown. an unbiased screening was performed using online-available datasets. liver tics were sorted by facs using surface markers cd133, cd13 and epcam, or enriched by oncosphere formation assay. tic self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncrna. rna pulldown, rna immunoprecipitation, chip, western blot and double fish were used to explore the molecular mechanism of lncrna. here, we examined the expression",lnchoxa drive liver tic self renewal tumorigenesis via hoxa transcription activation liver one deadly world various cell liver bulk include liver initiate cell tic account liver tumorigenesis drug resistance relapse metastasis homeobox hox transcription factor play critical role many physiological pathological process role liver tic liver tumorigenesis remain unknown unbiased screening perform use online available datasets liver tic sort facs use surface marker cd cd epcam enrich oncosphere formation assay tic self renewal examine oncosphere formation initiation assay loss function gain function assay perform examine role lncrna rna pulldown rna immunoprecipitation chip western blot double fish use explore molecular mechanism lncrna examine expression,b,Liver Cancer
"A natural process of cirrhosis resolution and deceleration of liver regeneration after thioacetamide withdrawal in a rat model Characteristics of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver cirrhosis in rat was observed for 120 days after TAA withdrawal as part of the radiobiological study of partial liver irradiation on TAA-induced cirrhotic rats. The natural process focused on cirrhosis and regeneration was recorded as a baseline condition for the interpretation of the outcome of the partial liver irradiation study. Cirrhosis in rats was successfully induced by drinking 0.03% TAA water orally for 29 weeks with a modeling rate of 96%. After establishment of the cirrhosis model, the rats were observed for 120 days upon TAA withdrawal to investigate the dynamic changes of cirrhosis and regeneration. The following characteristics were observed: (1) Histological changes; (2) Liver functions; (3) Cirrhosis: trichrome stain, quantification of hydroxyproline in hydrolysed liver tissue and TGF-β1; (4) Liver regeneration: liver index, hepatocyte mitotic index (MI), hepatocyte proliferation index (PI) by flow cytometry, PCNA labeling index (LI) by IHC and expression of PCNA mRNA; and (5) Growth factors: serum HGF, VEGF, TGF-α, and IL-6. After TAA withdrawal, gradual improvement in liver functions was noted with decreases of ALT, AST, and ALP, and increase of PA. The resolution of cirrhosis was evident by histological improvement with attenuation of collagen fiber and decrease of TGF-β1 IHC index, and also decrease of trichrome stain and hydroxyproline content. However, cirrhosis was still existed on 120 days after TAA withdrawal. Significant deceleration of liver regeneration was demonstrated with TAA withdrawal, evidenced by decrease of MI and PI, reduced expression of PCNA mRNA and PCNA LI. In conclusion, upon TAA withdrawal hepatic cirrhosis was continuously resolved, but persisted up to 120 days, and liver regeneration was significantly decelerated.","a natural process of cirrhosis resolution and deceleration of liver regeneration after thioacetamide withdrawal in a rat model characteristics of thioacetamide (taa)-induced liver cirrhosis in rat was observed for 120 days after taa withdrawal as part of the radiobiological study of partial liver irradiation on taa-induced cirrhotic rats. the natural process focused on cirrhosis and regeneration was recorded as a baseline condition for the interpretation of the outcome of the partial liver irradiation study. cirrhosis in rats was successfully induced by drinking 0.03% taa water orally for 29 weeks with a modeling rate of 96%. after establishment of the cirrhosis model, the rats were observed for 120 days upon taa withdrawal to investigate the dynamic changes of cirrhosis and regeneration. the following characteristics were observed: (1) histological changes; (2) liver functions; (3) cirrhosis: trichrome stain, quantification of hydroxyproline in hydrolysed liver tissue and tgf-β1; (4) liver regeneration: liver index, hepatocyte",natural process cirrhosis resolution deceleration liver regeneration thioacetamide withdrawal rat model characteristic thioacetamide taa induce liver cirrhosis rat observe day taa withdrawal part radiobiological partial liver irradiation taa induce cirrhotic rat natural process focus cirrhosis regeneration record baseline condition interpretation outcome partial liver irradiation cirrhosis rat successfully induce drink taa water orally week model rate establishment cirrhosis model rat observe day upon taa withdrawal investigate dynamic change cirrhosis regeneration following characteristic observe histological change liver function cirrhosis trichrome stain quantification hydroxyproline hydrolysed liver tissue tgf liver regeneration liver index hepatocyte,b,Liver Cancer
"Laparoscopically guided bipolar radiofrequency ablation of areas of porcine liver Background: Bipolar radiofrequency ablation (BRFA) is a promising technique with which to treat unresectable primary and metastatic liver tumors. Its effects on normal liver tissue and postoperative liver function, however, are unknown. We performed this study to determine (1) the feasibility of using laparoscopic ultrasound to guide placement of BRFA needle electrodes in the liver and (2) the histopathologic, hepatic biochemical, and systemic hemodynamic responses to BRFA.;  ; Methods: Two BRFA lesions were created in the liver of adult domestic pigs to ablate 8–10% of the normal liver volume. Laparoscopic ultrasound was used to guide creation of one peripheral liver lesion and one central liver lesion (with a major hepatic or portal venous vein branch in the center of the BRFA lesions) in each animal. BRFA of liver tissue was performed by passing 12 W of RF power for 16 min across two 16-gauge active-needle electrodes placed 3 cm apart.;  ; Results: All animals survived the procedure without significant hemodynamic alterations during or after BRFA. All animals had a transient elevation in serum transaminase levels that returned to normal within 1 week of the BRFA of liver tissue. Gross and microscopic histopathology of the BRFA lesions revealed 2.0–2.5-cm zones of complete coagulative necrosis around and between the BRFA needle tracks without destruction of major blood vessel walls.;  ; Conclusions: This study demonstrates (1) that laparoscopic ultrasound can be used to guide placement of BRFA needles in the liver and (2) that BRFA produces focal destruction of liver without significant systemic hemodynamic responses or alterations in liver function. Further studies of this technique to ablate malignant liver tumors are ongoing.","laparoscopically guided bipolar radiofrequency ablation of areas of porcine liver background: bipolar radiofrequency ablation (brfa) is a promising technique with which to treat unresectable primary and metastatic liver tumors. its effects on normal liver tissue and postoperative liver function, however, are unknown. we performed this study to determine (1) the feasibility of using laparoscopic ultrasound to guide placement of brfa needle electrodes in the liver and (2) the histopathologic, hepatic biochemical, and systemic hemodynamic responses to brfa.; ; methods: two brfa lesions were created in the liver of adult domestic pigs to ablate 8–10% of the normal liver volume. laparoscopic ultrasound was used to guide creation of one peripheral liver lesion and one central liver lesion (with a major hepatic or portal venous vein branch in the center of the brfa lesions) in each animal. brfa of liver tissue was performed by passing 12 w of rf power for 16",laparoscopically guide bipolar radiofrequency ablation area porcine liver bipolar radiofrequency ablation brfa promising technique treat unresectable primary metastatic liver effect normal liver tissue postoperative liver function however unknown perform determine feasibility use laparoscopic ultrasound guide placement brfa needle electrode liver histopathologic hepatic biochemical systemic hemodynamic response brfa method two brfa lesion create liver adult domestic pig ablate normal liver volume laparoscopic ultrasound use guide creation one peripheral liver lesion one central liver lesion major hepatic portal venous vein branch center brfa lesion animal brfa liver tissue perform pass w rf power,b,Liver Cancer

"Thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in Yemen: a three-year retrospective study in a tertiary center and a specialty clinic. The prevalence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide. No previous data are available on the prevalence of thyroid cancer in Yemen. We performed this study to determine the prevalence of thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in Yemen. A retrospective chart review was performed for 550 patients with thyroid nodules who underwent fine needle aspiration and/or thyroid surgery at a private endocrine clinic and at an endocrine clinic in a tertiary hospital in Yemen over a 3 -year period from October 2016–2019. The prevalence of thyroid cancer; the sonographic findings, Bethesda classification, age, sex, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels of the patients; and the nodule size and number were reviewed. A total of 550 charts were reviewed [501 females (91.1%) and 49 males (8.9%)]. The thyroid cancer prevalence among the patients was 13.8% (CI = 10.9–16.7), and the mean age of the patients was 38.5 years (SD = 12.2). The TSH level and the rate of cancer were significantly related (P = 0.01), but no significant difference in the prevalence of thyroid cancer was found between females (13.4%) and males (18.4%) (P = 0.334). When correlating the rate of cancer with the ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (UG-FNA) result, those with Bethesda system category III and IV, V and VI had malignancy rates of 20.8, 27.2, 52.4 and 69.2%, respectively. Thyroid nodules highly suspicious for malignancy on ultrasound had a 70% cancer diagnosis rate. The most common thyroid cancer was papillary cancer (71%), followed by follicular cancer (23.7%). Among those undergoing surgery, 44.2% had thyroid cancer, and 5.2% had a premalignant diagnosis. Thyroid cancer has a higher prevalence in Yemen than in other middle eastern countries. Our study also reports a higher rate of follicular thyroid cancer than that in other published data, which has to be confirmed by further studies. The malignancy and premalignant diagnosis rate was ~ 50% in our patients who underwent surgery. Many centers in Yemen still do not perform FNA before thyroid surgery. It is important that other centers in the country start emphasizing the need for FNA before surgery. This will decrease the number of unnecessary surgeries and associated complications.","thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in yemen: a three-year retrospective study in a tertiary center and a specialty clinic. the prevalence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide. no previous data are available on the prevalence of thyroid cancer in yemen. we performed this study to determine the prevalence of thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in yemen. a retrospective chart review was performed for 550 patients with thyroid nodules who underwent fine needle aspiration and/or thyroid surgery at a private endocrine clinic and at an endocrine clinic in a tertiary hospital in yemen over a 3 -year period from october 2016–2019. the prevalence of thyroid cancer; the sonographic findings, bethesda classification, age, sex, thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) levels of the patients; and the nodule size and number were reviewed. a total of 550 charts were reviewed [501 females (91.1%) and 49 males (8.9%)]. the thyroid cancer prevalence",thyroid among thyroid nodule yemen three year retrospective tertiary center specialty clinic prevalence thyroid increase worldwide previous data available prevalence thyroid yemen perform determine prevalence thyroid among thyroid nodule yemen retrospective chart review perform thyroid nodule undergo fine needle aspiration thyroid surgery private endocrine clinic endocrine clinic tertiary hospital yemen year period october prevalence thyroid sonographic finding bethesda classification age sex thyroid stimulate hormone tsh level nodule size number review total chart review female males thyroid prevalence,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and suppresses the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating STAT3/CXCL8 pathway. Colon cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. Tea catechin exerts anti-tumor effects in colon cancer. This work aimed to determine the functions of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the main active components of Tea catechins, in the progression of colon cancer. In this work, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting was utilized to examine the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, STAT3, p-STAT3 and CXCL8 in colon cancer patients and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of colon cancer patients, and the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 and CXCL8 was elevated in the neutrophils derived from colon cancer patients. Moreover, neutrophils were treated with phorbol ester (PMA) or DNase I to induce or impede the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Both STAT3 overexpression and PMA treatment promoted the expression of CXCL8, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) in the colon cancer-derived neutrophils, indicating that STAT3 overexpression facilitated the formation of NETs. STAT3 deficiency suppressed the formation of NETs, which consistent with the results of DNase I treatment. Transwell assay was utilized to detect the migration and invasion of colon cancer cell line SW480. EGCG treatment suppressed the formation of NETs and the expression of STAT3 and CXCL8 in the colon cancer-derived neutrophils, and then inhibited the migration and invasion of SW480 cells. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that EGCG inhibited the formation of NETs and subsequent suppressed the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating STAT3/CXCL8 signalling pathway. Thus, this study suggests that EGCG may become a potential drug for colon cancer therapy.","epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and suppresses the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating stat3/cxcl8 pathway. colon cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. tea catechin exerts anti-tumor effects in colon cancer. this work aimed to determine the functions of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), one of the main active components of tea catechins, in the progression of colon cancer. in this work, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay, quantitative real-time pcr and western blotting was utilized to examine the levels of il-1β, tnf-α, stat3, p-stat3 and cxcl8 in colon cancer patients and healthy controls. compared with healthy controls, the levels of il-1β and tnf-α were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of colon cancer patients, and the expression of stat3, p-stat3 and cxcl8 was elevated in the neutrophils derived from colon cancer patients. moreover, neutrophils were treated with phorbol ester (pma) or dnase i to induce",epigallocatechin gallate inhibit formation neutrophil extracellular trap suppress migration invasion colon cell regulate stat cxcl pathway colon common malignant digestive tract tea catechin exerts anti effect colon work determine function epigallocatechin gallate egcg one main active component tea catechin progression colon work enzyme link immune sorbent assay quantitative real time pcr western blotting utilize examine level il tnf stat p stat cxcl colon healthy control compare healthy control level il tnf significantly increase peripheral blood colon expression stat p stat cxcl elevate neutrophil derive colon moreover neutrophil treat phorbol ester pma dnase induce,a,Colon Cancer

"Spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China Lung cancer is the most common cancer in China. Previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. However, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China remains unclear. In this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in China in 2013 with annual concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 were analysed. GeoDetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer. An apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. Among the six selected pollutants, SO2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q = 0.154 in females) in north China. In the south, each selected pollutant has a significant impact on males or females, and the mean q value in the south is 0.181, which is bigger than that in the north (q = 0.154). In addition, the pollutants have evident non-linear interaction effects on lung cancer. In north China, the interaction between SO2 and PM2.5 is the dominant interaction, with q values of 0.207 in males and 0.334 in females. In the south, the dominant interactive factors are between SO2 and O3 in males and between SO2 and CO in females, with q values of 0.45, 0.232 respectively. Smoking is a substantial contributor to lung cancer among men, either in South or North China, with q value of 0.143 and 0.129 respectively, and the interaction between smoking and air pollutants increases this risk. This study implies that the influence of SO2 and PM2.5 on lung cancer should be focused on in north China, and in the south, the impact of O3 and CO as well as their interaction with SO2 need to be paid more attention. Smoking, particularly in men, remains a significant risk factor for lung cancer in both North and South China.","spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in china lung cancer is the most common cancer in china. previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. however, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in china remains unclear. in this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in china in 2013 with annual concentrations of pm2.5, pm10, so2, no2, co and o3 were analysed. geodetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer. an apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. among the six selected pollutants, so2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q = 0.154",spatial association outdoor air pollution lung incidence china lung common china previous indicate lung incidence exhibit remarkable spatial heterogeneity lung relate outdoor air pollution however non linear spatial association outdoor air pollution lung incidence china remains unclear relationship lung incidence male female county china annual concentration pm pm co analyse geodetector q statistic use examine non linear spatial association outdoor air pollution incidence lung apparent spatial population gender heterogeneity find spatial association outdoor air pollution lung incidence among six select pollutant great influence lung q,c,Lung Cancer
"Reduction in arsenic intake from water has different impacts on lung cancer and bladder cancer in an arseniasis endemic area in Taiwan Excessive arsenic intake has a detrimental effect on human health, as reflected in an increase in cancer incidence. In an area on the southwest coast of Taiwan, arsenic intake from well water since the 1920s had caused an exceptionally high mortality from cancer. Municipal water has become available to people living in the arseniasis endemic area since the early 1970s. This study explored the impacts of reduction in arsenic intake from water on lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area in Taiwan. Chart records of 23,013 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and 93,633 patients with lung cancer from 1979 to 2003 were retrieved from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Center. We used the age-period-cohort model to study the changes in the incidence of lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area and the rest of Taiwan. Three decades after municipal water supply to the arseniasis and black foot disease endemic area (BFDEA), we saw a marked decrease in the incidence of both bladder cancer and lung cancer in the area, especially for those in the later cohorts. The relative risk (RR) of getting a bladder cancer for people living in BFDEA when compared with those in the rest of Taiwan has dropped from 20 for the early cohorts to 5 for the late cohorts. As to lung cancer, the RR has decreased from 8 to between 1.5 and 2. Reduction in arsenic intake from water has a positive impact on the incidence of both lung and bladder cancer; however, while RR for lung cancer has dropped to below 2, RR for bladder cancer remained at around 5. The difference may be because (1) there are other risk factors beside the well-water intake or (2) bladder cancer may have longer latency period for excessive arsenic exposure than lung cancer. More studies are required to understand the causes behind the difference in RR for these two types of cancer.","reduction in arsenic intake from water has different impacts on lung cancer and bladder cancer in an arseniasis endemic area in taiwan excessive arsenic intake has a detrimental effect on human health, as reflected in an increase in cancer incidence. in an area on the southwest coast of taiwan, arsenic intake from well water since the 1920s had caused an exceptionally high mortality from cancer. municipal water has become available to people living in the arseniasis endemic area since the early 1970s. this study explored the impacts of reduction in arsenic intake from water on lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area in taiwan. chart records of 23,013 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and 93,633 patients with lung cancer from 1979 to 2003 were retrieved from the taiwan cancer registry center. we used the age-period-cohort model to study the changes in the incidence of lung cancer and",reduction arsenic intake water different impact lung bladder arseniasis endemic area taiwan excessive arsenic intake detrimental effect human health reflect increase incidence area southwest coast taiwan arsenic intake well water since cause exceptionally high mortality municipal water become available people live arseniasis endemic area since early explore impact reduction arsenic intake water lung bladder arseniasis endemic area taiwan chart record diagnose bladder lung retrieve taiwan registry center use age period cohort model change incidence lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis and prevents polarization of M2 tumor-associated macrophages through YAP oncogenic pathways An increased expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP1) has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in many cancer types including colon. However, the role of YAP1 in promoting colon tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that YAP1 expression is associated with M2 tumor-associated macrophage polarization and the generation of colon cancer stem-like cells. YAP1 downregulation by gene silencing or a phytochemical, ovatodiolide, not only suppresses colon cancer tumorigenesis but also prevents M2 TAM polarization. Human monocytic cells, THP-1, and colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and DLD-1, were co-cultured to mimic the interactions between tumor and its microenvironment. M2 polarization of the THP-1 cells were examined using both flow cytometry and q-PCR technique. The inhibition of YAP1 signaling was achieved by gene-silencing technique or ovatodiolide. The molecular consequences of YAP1 inhibition was demonstrated via colony formation, migration, and colon-sphere formation assays. 5-FU and ovatodiolide were used in drug combination studies. Xenograft and syngeneic mouse models were used to investigate the role of YAP1 in colon tumorigenesis and TAM generation. An increased YAP1 expression was found to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer using bioinformatics approach. We showed an increased YAP1 expression in the colon spheres, and colon cancer cells co-cultured with M2 TAMs. YAP1-silencing led to the concomitant decreased expression of major oncogenic pathways including Kras, mTOR, β-catenin, and M2-promoting IL-4 and tumor-promoting IL-6 cytokines. TAM co-cultured colon spheres showed a significantly higher tumor-initiating ability in vivo. Ovatodiolide treatment alone and in combination with 5-FU significantly suppressed in vivo tumorigenesis and less TAM infiltration in CT26 syngeneic mouse model. We have identified the dual function of YAP1 where its suppression not only inhibited tumorigenesis but also prevented the generation of cancer stem-like cells and M2 TAM polarization. Ovatodiolide treatment suppressed YAP1 oncogenic pathways to inhibit colon tumorigenesis and M2 TAM generation both in vitro and in vivo. Ovatodiolide should be considered for its potential for adjuvant therapeutic development.","ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis and prevents polarization of m2 tumor-associated macrophages through yap oncogenic pathways an increased expression of yes-associated protein (yap1) has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in many cancer types including colon. however, the role of yap1 in promoting colon tumorigenesis remains unclear. here, we demonstrate that yap1 expression is associated with m2 tumor-associated macrophage polarization and the generation of colon cancer stem-like cells. yap1 downregulation by gene silencing or a phytochemical, ovatodiolide, not only suppresses colon cancer tumorigenesis but also prevents m2 tam polarization. human monocytic cells, thp-1, and colon cancer cell lines, hct116 and dld-1, were co-cultured to mimic the interactions between tumor and its microenvironment. m2 polarization of the thp-1 cells were examined using both flow cytometry and q-pcr technique. the inhibition of yap1 signaling was achieved by gene-silencing technique or ovatodiolide. the molecular consequences of yap1 inhibition was demonstrated via colony formation, migration, and",ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis prevents polarization associate macrophage yap oncogenic pathways increased expression yes associate protein yap show promote tumorigenesis many type include colon however role yap promote colon tumorigenesis remain unclear demonstrate yap expression associate associate macrophage polarization generation colon stem like cell yap downregulation gene silencing phytochemical ovatodiolide suppress colon tumorigenesis also prevent tam polarization human monocytic cell thp colon cell line hct dld co culture mimic interaction microenvironment polarization thp cell examine use flow cytometry q pcr technique inhibition yap signaling achieve gene silence technique ovatodiolide molecular consequence yap inhibition demonstrate via colony formation migration,a,Colon Cancer
"Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon. Persistent descending mesocolon (PDM) is caused by the absence of fusion of the descending colon to the retroperitoneum. We herein report two colorectal cancer cases with PDM that were treated with laparoscopic surgery. Case 1: a 50-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with lymph node dissection cutting the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and synchronous liver resection. He experienced postoperative stenosis of the reconstructed colon possibly due to an impaired arterial blood flow in the reconstructed colon. Case 2: a 77-year-old man with rectal cancer. Laparoscopic low anterior resection preserving the left colic artery (LCA) was performed. Intraoperative infrared ray (IR) imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) showed good blood flow of the reconstructed colon. He had no postoperative complications. In cases of PDM, the mesentery of the descending and sigmoid colon containing the LCA is often shortened, and the marginal artery of the reconstructed colon is located close to the root of the LCA. Lymph node dissection accompanied by cutting the LCA carries a risk of marginal artery injury. Therefore, we recommend lymph node dissection preserving the LCA in colorectal cancer patients with PDM in order to maintain the blood flow of the reconstructed colon. If the IMA and LCA absolutely need to be cut for complete lymph node dissection, the marginal artery should be clearly identified and preserved. In addition, intraoperative IR imaging is extremely useful for evaluating colonic perfusion and reducing the risk of anastomotic complications. In colorectal cancer surgery in patients with PDM, surgeons should be aware of these tips for maintaining the blood flow of the reconstructed colon and thereby avoid postoperative complications caused by an impaired blood flow.","laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon. persistent descending mesocolon (pdm) is caused by the absence of fusion of the descending colon to the retroperitoneum. we herein report two colorectal cancer cases with pdm that were treated with laparoscopic surgery. case 1: a 50-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis. after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with lymph node dissection cutting the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (ima) and synchronous liver resection. he experienced postoperative stenosis of the reconstructed colon possibly due to an impaired arterial blood flow in the reconstructed colon. case 2: a 77-year-old man with rectal cancer. laparoscopic low anterior resection preserving the left colic artery (lca) was performed. intraoperative infrared ray (ir) imaging using indocyanine green (icg) showed good blood flow of the reconstructed colon. he had no postoperative complications. in cases of pdm, the mesentery of the descending",laparoscopic surgery colorectal persistent descend mesocolon persistent descend mesocolon pdm cause absence fusion descend colon retroperitoneum herein report two colorectal pdm treat laparoscopic surgery year old man sigmoid colon synchronous liver metastasis neoadjuvant chemotherapy underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy lymph node dissection cut root inferior mesenteric artery ima synchronous liver resection experience postoperative stenosis reconstructed colon possibly due impaired arterial blood flow reconstructed colon year old man rectal laparoscopic low anterior resection preserve left colic artery lca perform intraoperative infrared ray ir image use indocyanine green icg show good blood flow reconstructed colon postoperative complication pdm mesentery descending,a,Colon Cancer
"A phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis reveals the genetical associations of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer. Lung cancer is a complex disease with varying subtypes. The genetic architectures and risk factors that are similar or distinct among these subtypes remain unclear. In this work, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by the International Lung Cancer Consortium and transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung were utilized to illustrate the genetic landscapes of different subtypes of lung cancer. GWAS of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank and 902 phenotypes from FinnGen Biobank were analyzed to identify the genetic risk factors specific or common to each subtype of lung cancer through two sample Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighting method. Multivariable Mendelian randomization was employed to assess the true causals of lung cancer. We found that lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma shared similar, yet varied genetic architectures. Genetic risk loci at 15q25 were identified in all types of lung cancer. Yet, genetic risk loci at 5p15 were observed in squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, but not in small cell lung carcinoma. Out of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank, smoking, time spent watching television, age first had sexual intercourse, alcohol usually taken with meal and age at first live birth were common risk factors for all types of lung cancer. Moreover, out of 902 traits in FinnGen Biobank, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was positively associated with small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. Angina pectoris and myocardial infarction were negatively associated with lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. And Alzheimer's disease was negatively associated with lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer. In further weighted median and weighted mode methods, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease also had genetical associations with lung cancer or its subtypes. Even, considering factors such as smoking, COPD, and other risk factors together, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease retained the genetical associations with lung cancer and its subtypes. Overall, in a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis, our results have highlighted both similar and distinct risk factors among different subtypes of lung cancer. Additionally, our findings have provided genetic associations linking myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer or its various subtypes.","a phenome-wide mendelian randomization analysis reveals the genetical associations of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and alzheimer's disease with lung cancer. lung cancer is a complex disease with varying subtypes. the genetic architectures and risk factors that are similar or distinct among these subtypes remain unclear. in this work, genome-wide association studies (gwas) conducted by the international lung cancer consortium and transdisciplinary research in cancer of the lung were utilized to illustrate the genetic landscapes of different subtypes of lung cancer. gwas of 942 phenotypes from uk biobank and 902 phenotypes from finngen biobank were analyzed to identify the genetic risk factors specific or common to each subtype of lung cancer through two sample mendelian randomization inverse variance weighting method. multivariable mendelian randomization was employed to assess the true causals of lung cancer. we found that lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma shared similar,",phenome wide mendelian randomization reveal genetical association myocardial infarction angina pectoris alzheimer lung lung complex vary subtypes genetic architecture risk factor similar distinct among subtypes remain unclear work genome wide association gwas conduct international lung consortium transdisciplinary research lung utilize illustrate genetic landscape different subtypes lung gwas phenotype uk biobank phenotype finngen biobank analyze identify genetic risk factor specific common subtype lung two sample mendelian randomization inverse variance weight method multivariable mendelian randomization employ assess true causals lung find lung small cell lung carcinoma squamous cell lung lung adenocarcinoma share similar,c,Lung Cancer

"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Upregulates CXCR7 and Contributes to Chemotherapy Resistance in Colorectal Cancer. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates making it a focus of research. Chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality for colon cancer, but chemotherapy resistance severely impacts treatment efficacy. MIF has been found to promote tumor progression and resistance in various cancers. This study aims to investigate the role of MIF in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer and its potential mechanisms, particularly through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, affecting the metabolism and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells. The expression levels of MIF in colon cancer tissues and its association with patient prognosis were evaluated by analyzing TCGA and HPA data. Subsequently, the expression levels of MIF in colon cancer cell lines and resistant cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and the effect of MIF on oxaliplatin sensitivity was assessed. The impact of MIF on the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells was measured using a cellular energy metabolism analyzer. Further experiments explored the mechanism by which MIF affects the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, and the role of CTCF in regulating CXCR7 transcription was validated by silencing CTCF. Finally, the effect of MIF on drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells was verified in a mouse xenograft tumor model. In this study, we found that the expression of MIF in colon cancer tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues, and high MIF expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients. The expression levels of MIF in resistant colon cancer cell lines were significantly higher than in parental cell lines, and MIF overexpression significantly increased the resistance of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. Conversely, silencing MIF significantly reduced the IC50 value of resistant cells and increased apoptosis. MIF overexpression significantly increased the ECAR and OCR levels of colon cancer cells, while MIF knockdown significantly reduced these metabolic indicators. Further studies indicated that MIF affects the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells by upregulating CXCR7 expression. CTCF binding peaks at the CXCR7 promoter region and luciferase activity assays indicated that CTCF regulates CXCR7 transcription, and silencing CTCF significantly enhanced the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. In vivo experiments in mice showed that MIF silencing combined with oxaliplatin treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased the necrotic area of tumor tissues. In conclusion, this study reveals the crucial role of MIF in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, with CTCF playing an important regulatory role in this process. Our findings provide new theoretical insights and potential therapeutic targets for overcoming chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer. Future research should further explore the roles of MIF and CXCR7 in other types of cancers and the potential of MIF and CXCR7 as therapeutic targets.","macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) upregulates cxcr7 and contributes to chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer. colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates making it a focus of research. chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality for colon cancer, but chemotherapy resistance severely impacts treatment efficacy. mif has been found to promote tumor progression and resistance in various cancers. this study aims to investigate the role of mif in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer and its potential mechanisms, particularly through the upregulation of cxcr7 expression, affecting the metabolism and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells. the expression levels of mif in colon cancer tissues and its association with patient prognosis were evaluated by analyzing tcga and hpa data. subsequently, the expression levels of mif in colon cancer cell lines and resistant cell lines were detected by qrt-pcr and immunohistochemistry, and the effect",macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif upregulates cxcr contributes chemotherapy resistance colorectal colorectal one common malignant worldwide high incidence mortality rate make focus research chemotherapy primary modality colon chemotherapy resistance severely impact efficacy mif find promote progression resistance various investigate role mif chemotherapy resistance colon potential mechanism particularly upregulation cxcr expression affect metabolism drug sensitivity colon cell expression level mif colon tissue association prognosis evaluate analyze tcga hpa data subsequently expression level mif colon cell line resistant cell line detect qrt pcr immunohistochemistry effect,a,Colon Cancer
"Comprehensive analyses of correlation and survival reveal informative lncRNA prognostic signatures in colon cancer Colon cancer is a commonly worldwide cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes and are closely related to the occurrence of colon cancer. Identification of the prognostic signatures of lncRNAs in colon cancer has great significance for its treatment. We first identified the colon cancer-related mRNAs and lncRNAs according to the differential analysis methods using the expression data in TCGA. Then, we performed correlation analysis between the identified mRNAs and lncRNAs by integrating their expression values and secondary structure information to estimate the co-regulatory relationships between the cancer-related mRNAs and lncRNAs. Besides, the competing endogenous RNA regulation network based on co-regulatory relationships was constructed to reveal cancer-related regulatory patterns. Meanwhile, we used traditional regression analysis (univariate Cox analysis, random survival forest analysis, and lasso regression analysis) to screen the cancer-related lncRNAs. Finally, by combining the identified colon cancer-related lncRNAs according to the above analyses, we constructed a risk prognosis model for colon cancer through multivariate Cox analysis and also validated the model in the colon cancer dataset in TCGA cohorts. Six lncRNAs were found highly correlated with the overall survival of colon cancer patients, and a risk prognosis model based on them was constructed to predict the overall survival of colon cancer patients. In particular, EVX1-AS, ZNF667-AS1, CTC-428G20.6, and CTC-297N7.9 were first reported to be related to colon cancer by using our model, among which EVX1-AS and ZNF667-AS1 have been predicted to be related to colon cancer in LncRNADisease database.

"Elastin is a key factor of tumor development in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins regulate tumor growth and development in CRC. Elastin (ELN) is a component of ECM proteins involved in the tumor microenvironment. However, the role of ELN in CRC remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed ELN gene expression in tumors from CRC patients and adjacent non-tumor colon tissues and healthy controls from two existing microarray datasets. ELN protein was measured in human normal colon cells and colon cancer epithelial cells and tumor development was assessed in colon epithelial cells cultured in medium with or without ELN peptide on plates coated with ELN recombinant protein. Control plates were coated with PBS only. We found ELN gene expression was increased in tumors from CRC patients compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and healthy controls. ELN protein was increased in cancer cells compared to normal colon epithelial cells. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) was a key cytokine to induce production of ECM proteins, but it did not induce ELN expression in colon cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene expression was increased, but that of MMP12 (elastase) did not change between CRC patients and control. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) gene expression was decreased in colon tissues from CRC patients compared to healthy controls. However, MMP9, MMP12 and TIMP3 proteins were increased in colon cancer cells. ELN recombinant protein increased proliferation and wound healing in colon cancer epithelial cells. This had further increased in cancer cells incubated in plates coated with recombinant ELN coated plate and in culture media containing ELN peptide. A potential mechanism was that ELN induced epithelial mesenchymal transition with increased alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin proteins but decreased E-cadherin protein. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) mRNA was also increased in CRC patients compared to controls. ELN recombinant protein induced further increases in TNF protein in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages after lipopolysaccharide stimulation.

"Consequences of atmospheric contamination by radioiodine: the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents. After the accidents of nuclear power plants at Chernobyl and at Fukushima, huge amounts of radioactive iodine were released into the atmosphere. We reviewed data on the health consequences of these accidents with a focus on thyroid consequences. Among the 2 million children who were living in highly contaminated regions in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, 7000 cases of thyroid cancer had occurred in 2005. This is the most significant radiation-induced consequence of the Chernobyl accident. The increased incidence of thyroid cancer observed in adult population who lived in these highly contaminated regions is at least in major part related to screening and it is not possible to individualize among these thyroid cancers those that are potentially caused by radiation exposure. For populations who lived outside these regions at the time of the accident, there is no detectable consequence of the radiation exposure on the thyroid gland. Among children who lived nearby the Fukushima power plant in 2011, there is currently no evidence of an increased incidence of thyroid cancer. Ultrasonography screening in these individuals detected a number of thyroid cancers that are probably not related to the accident. Because thyroid cancer is frequent, studies have been carried out to distinguish radiation-induced from their sporadic counterparts, and genomic signatures might be helpful. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident clearly demonstrate that populations living nearby a nuclear power plant should be protected in case of accident by sheltering, food restrictions and prophylaxis of thyroid irradiation by potassium iodine administration, if the predicted estimated dose to the thyroid gland of children might be >50 mGy. These countermeasures should be applied in priority to children, adolescents and pregnant women; they are safe and effective.","consequences of atmospheric contamination by radioiodine: the chernobyl and fukushima accidents. after the accidents of nuclear power plants at chernobyl and at fukushima, huge amounts of radioactive iodine were released into the atmosphere. we reviewed data on the health consequences of these accidents with a focus on thyroid consequences. among the 2 million children who were living in highly contaminated regions in belarus, ukraine and russia, 7000 cases of thyroid cancer had occurred in 2005. this is the most significant radiation-induced consequence of the chernobyl accident. the increased incidence of thyroid cancer observed in adult population who lived in these highly contaminated regions is at least in major part related to screening and it is not possible to individualize among these thyroid cancers those that are potentially caused by radiation exposure. for populations who lived outside these regions at the time of the accident, there is no detectable consequence of",consequence atmospheric contamination radioiodine chernobyl fukushima accident accident nuclear power plant chernobyl fukushima huge amount radioactive iodine release atmosphere review data health consequence accident focus thyroid consequence among million child live highly contaminate region belarus ukraine russia thyroid occur significant radiation induce consequence chernobyl accident increase incidence thyroid observe adult population live highly contaminated region least major part relate screen possible individualize among thyroid potentially cause radiation exposure population live outside region time accident detectable consequence,e,Thyroid Cancer

"4. Cancers attributable to dietary factors in the UK in 2010: I. Low consumption of fruit and vegetables There is considerable controversy over the protective effect of diets rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre, and the respective roles of the different components (including micronutrients such as folate). The report of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Nutrition Policy (COMA) (Department of Health, 1998) recommended increasing consumption of all of them, an advice that seems to have motivated the Department of Health in promoting its ‘5-a-day’ programme (Department of Health, 2005). The original consensus of the probable decrease in risk of several cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and colorectum) associated with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (WHO/FAO, 2003) was based on the results of multiple case–control studies and a few prospective studies. The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention (IARC, 2003) concludes its review of the evidence as follows: There is limited evidence for cancer-preventive effect of consumption of fruit and vegetables for cancers of the mouth and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, larynx, lung, ovary (vegetables only), bladder (fruit only) and kidney.; There is inadequate evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of consumption of fruit and vegetables for all other sites.; More specifically, this evidence indicates that higher intake of fruit probably lowers the risk of cancers of the oesophagus, stomach and lung, while higher intake of vegetables probably lowers the risk of cancers of the oesophagus and colorectum.; Likewise a higher intake of fruit possibly lowers the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, colorectum, larynx, kidney and urinary bladder. An increase in consumption of vegetables possibly reduces the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, stomach, larynx, lung, ovary and kidney.","4. cancers attributable to dietary factors in the uk in 2010: i. low consumption of fruit and vegetables there is considerable controversy over the protective effect of diets rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre, and the respective roles of the different components (including micronutrients such as folate). the report of the committee on medical aspects of food nutrition policy (coma) (department of health, 1998) recommended increasing consumption of all of them, an advice that seems to have motivated the department of health in promoting its ‘5-a-day’ programme (department of health, 2005). the original consensus of the probable decrease in risk of several cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and colorectum) associated with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (who/fao, 2003) was based on the results of multiple case–control studies and a few prospective studies. the iarc handbook of cancer prevention (iarc, 2003) concludes its review",attributable dietary factor uk low consumption fruit vegetable considerable controversy protective effect diet rich fruit vegetable fibre respective role different component include micronutrient folate report committee medical aspect food nutrition policy coma department health recommend increase consumption advice seem motivate department health promote day programme department health original consensus probable decrease risk several gastrointestinal tract oral cavity pharynx oesophagus stomach colorectum associate increased consumption fruit vegetable fao base result multiple control prospective iarc handbook prevention iarc conclude review,d,Stomach Cancer

"Secretion of interleukin-10 from murine colon carcinoma cells suppresses systemic antitumor immunity and impairs protective immunity induced against the tumors Interleukin -10 ( IL -10 ) is a T helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cytokine that suppresses Th1 -mediated, cell -mediated immune responses and reciprocally enhances antibody -mediated responses. Previous studies, however, demonstrated that forced expression of the IL -10 gene in tumor cells could unexpectedly produce antitumor effects. We then examined whether tumor -derived IL -10 could modulate systemic immune responses. Murine colon carcinoma ( Colon 26 ) cells that were retrovirally transduced with the murine IL -10 gene ( Colon 26 / IL -10 ) were inoculated in syngeneic immunocompetent or T cell -defective nude mice. Growth of Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors was augmented in immunocompetent and, to less extent, in nude mice compared with that of wild -type tumors developed in respective mice. Growth of wild -type tumors was accelerated to the same level as that of Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors when wild type and Colon 26 / IL -10 cells were respectively inoculated in different flanks of the same immunocompetent mice. This enhanced growth of wild -type tumors was not observed in nude mice. Immunocompetent mice that had rejected IL -2 -or IL -12 -secreting Colon 26 cells developed protective immunity and became completely resistant to wild -type Colon 26 cells subsequently challenged. However, some of the mice that had rejected IL -2 or IL -12 producers developed Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors inoculated thereafter. The present study showed that production of IL -10 from tumor cells impaired T cell -and non -T cell -mediated systemic antitumor immunity in hosts.","secretion of interleukin-10 from murine colon carcinoma cells suppresses systemic antitumor immunity and impairs protective immunity induced against the tumors interleukin -10 ( il -10 ) is a t helper type 2 ( th2 ) cytokine that suppresses th1 -mediated, cell -mediated immune responses and reciprocally enhances antibody -mediated responses. previous studies, however, demonstrated that forced expression of the il -10 gene in tumor cells could unexpectedly produce antitumor effects. we then examined whether tumor -derived il -10 could modulate systemic immune responses. murine colon carcinoma ( colon 26 ) cells that were retrovirally transduced with the murine il -10 gene ( colon 26 / il -10 ) were inoculated in syngeneic immunocompetent or t cell -defective nude mice. growth of colon 26 / il -10 tumors was augmented in immunocompetent and, to less extent, in nude mice compared with that of wild -type tumors developed in respective mice. growth",secretion interleukin murine colon carcinoma cell suppress systemic antitumor immunity impairs protective immunity induce interleukin il helper type th cytokine suppress th mediate cell mediate immune response reciprocally enhances antibody mediate response previous however demonstrate forced expression il gene cell could unexpectedly produce antitumor effect examine whether derive il could modulate systemic immune response murine colon carcinoma colon cell retrovirally transduce murine il gene colon il inoculate syngeneic immunocompetent cell defective nude mouse growth colon il augment immunocompetent less extent nude mouse compare wild type develop respective mouse growth,a,Colon Cancer
"FABP4 promotes invasion and metastasis of colon cancer by regulating fatty acid transport The prognosis of colon cancer is poor for metastasis, while the mechanism, especially adipocytes related, is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a transporter for lipids, on colon cancer progression. The distribution of lipids and FABP4 was tested in the colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their relationship was also verified in vitro. Experiments about cellular invasion, migration and proliferation were performed to detect the impacts of FABP4 on the biological behaviors of colon cancer, and the positive results were checked in vivo. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FABP4 in the energy and lipid metabolism was evaluated by the levels of triglyceride, ATP, LDH, glycerol and NEFA. At last, GO and KEGG analysis based on FABP4 overexpressed cells was performed, and the AKT pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were determined by Western blot. Higher accumulation of lipids and stronger FABP4 transcription were observed in colon cancer tissues. Having been incubated with adipose tissue extract and overexpressed FABP4, colon cancer cells demonstrated enhanced lipid accumulation. In functional experiments, co-culture with adipose tissue extract significantly enhanced the invasion and migration of colon cancer cells, as well as the energy and lipid metabolism, and all these processes were reversed by FABP4 inhibitor. In addition, the metastasis of FABP4-overexpressed colon cancer cells was also significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo. In terms of mechanism, the bioinformatics analysis showed that FABP4 was enriched in 11 pathways related to metabolic processes in FABP4 overexpressed cells. Finally, FABP4 overexpression improved EMT progression of colon cancer, as evidenced by the upregulation of Snail, MMP-2 and MMP-9, the downregulation of E-cadherin. The expression of p-Akt was also elevated. FABP4 overexpression could increase FAs transport to enhance energy and lipid metabolism, and activate AKT pathway and EMT to promote the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells.","fabp4 promotes invasion and metastasis of colon cancer by regulating fatty acid transport the prognosis of colon cancer is poor for metastasis, while the mechanism, especially adipocytes related, is not yet clear. the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of fatty acid binding protein 4 (fabp4), a transporter for lipids, on colon cancer progression. the distribution of lipids and fabp4 was tested in the colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their relationship was also verified in vitro. experiments about cellular invasion, migration and proliferation were performed to detect the impacts of fabp4 on the biological behaviors of colon cancer, and the positive results were checked in vivo. meanwhile, the regulatory role of fabp4 in the energy and lipid metabolism was evaluated by the levels of triglyceride, atp, ldh, glycerol and nefa. at last, go and kegg analysis based on fabp4 overexpressed cells was performed, and",fabp promote invasion metastasis colon regulate fatty acid transport prognosis colon poor metastasis mechanism especially adipocytes relate yet clear determine effect fatty acid bind protein fabp transporter lipid colon progression distribution lipid fabp test colon tissue adjacent normal tissue relationship also verify vitro experiment cellular invasion migration proliferation perform detect impact fabp biological behavior colon positive result check vivo meanwhile regulatory role fabp energy lipid metabolism evaluate level triglyceride atp ldh glycerol nefa last go kegg base fabp overexpressed cell perform,a,Colon Cancer

"Anthropometric factors at age 20 years and risk of thyroid cancer Effect of anthropometric factors at adolescence and the change since young age on thyroid cancer risk is unclear. Here, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between anthropometric factors at the time of diagnosis and age 20 years and risk of thyroid cancer. A total of 173 patients with thyroid cancer (papillary carcinoma, n = 167 and follicular carcinoma, n = 6) and 865 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Anthropometric factors were assessed using a validated self-administered questionnaire and categorized into three groups. Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. Results showed a positive association between current weights, weight at age 20 years and height, and thyroid cancer risk.

"Activity of vitamin A analogues in cell cultures of mouse epidermis and organ cultures of hamster trachea. FIFTY years after the discovery that vitamin A controls cel differentiation in epithelial tissues the mechanism involved is still unknown. The recent introduction of two-cell and organ culture systems, involving serum-free medium, for the assay of vitamin A activity in vitro may help. One assay uses epidermal cell cultures derived from mouse skin1 and the other uses tracheal organ cultures from vitamin A-deficient hamsters2. In both, the observed cellular response depends on the addition of vitamin A, which induces a marked increase in the cellular RNA of the skin cultures and a change from the production of keratin to the production of cilia and mucus in the tracheal organ cultures. We have now investigated the Biological activity of seven analogues of natural vitamin A ester (β-retinyl acetate) and vitamin A acid (β-retinoic acid), in line with the common practice of assaying physiological and pharmacological actions of vitamins, hormones and drugs using structural analogues of a parent compound. In the analogues we used, the 5,6-cyclohexenyl ring system of natural vitamin A is modified substantially. Although data obtained in vivo show that modification of the ring portion of the molecule can reduce growth-promoting activity3–5, we found that several vitamin A analogues with alterations in the ring, including a shift of the 5,6-double bond of the cyclohexene ring to the 4,5-position and replacement of the cyclohexene ring with substituted aromatic and cyclopentene rings, have substantial activity in the skin and tracheobronchial assays. Because of the sensitivity of the two assays it is now possible to assay vitamin A activity in the 10−9–10−10M range (30–300 pg ml−1). Moreover, there is excellent correlation between the results of the two assays in terms of the evaluation of Biol.ogical activity of new analogues.","activity of vitamin a analogues in cell cultures of mouse epidermis and organ cultures of hamster trachea. fifty years after the discovery that vitamin a controls cel differentiation in epithelial tissues the mechanism involved is still unknown. the recent introduction of two-cell and organ culture systems, involving serum-free medium, for the assay of vitamin a activity in vitro may help. one assay uses epidermal cell cultures derived from mouse skin1 and the other uses tracheal organ cultures from vitamin a-deficient hamsters2. in both, the observed cellular response depends on the addition of vitamin a, which induces a marked increase in the cellular rna of the skin cultures and a change from the production of keratin to the production of cilia and mucus in the tracheal organ cultures. we have now investigated the biological activity of seven analogues of natural vitamin a ester (β-retinyl acetate) and vitamin a acid (β-retinoic acid),",activity vitamin analogue cell culture mouse epidermis organ culture hamster trachea fifty year discovery vitamin control cel differentiation epithelial tissue mechanism involve still unknown recent two cell organ culture system involve serum free medium assay vitamin activity vitro may help one assay use epidermal cell culture derive mouse skin us tracheal organ culture vitamin deficient hamster observed cellular response depend addition vitamin induce marked increase cellular rna skin culture change production keratin production cilium mucus tracheal organ culture investigate biological activity seven analogue natural vitamin ester retinyl acetate vitamin acid retinoic acid,c,Lung Cancer

"Palate invasion in cT3/4 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma: a study of at least 5-year follow-up. Background The prognostic significance of palate invasion in cT3/4N0 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (MS-SCC) remains ambiguous. This study endeavors to elucidate the impact of palate invasion on the prognosis of cT3/4N0 MS-SCC and to ascertain whether diverse neck management strategies modulate this effect. Methods A retrospective analysis was undertaken on a cohort of patients with surgically managed cT3/4N0 MS-SCC, all of whom had a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. The influence of palate invasion on locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) was scrutinized using the Cox proportional hazards model. Additionally, the relationship between palate invasion and occult metastasis was evaluated through logistic regression analysis. Results The study encompassed 133 patients, among whom 39 (29.3%) exhibited palate invasion. Elective neck dissection was performed in 58 patients, while the remaining subjects received elective neck irradiation. The Cox model for LRC revealed that patients with palate invasion faced a significantly elevated risk of locoregional recurrence (HR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.17–1.90) compared to those without palate invasion. Similarly, the hazard ratio for palate invasion in the OS model was 1.64 (95%CI: 1.20–1.98), indicating a significantly poorer prognosis in cases with palate invasion. Both elective neck dissection and elective neck irradiation demonstrated comparable LRC and OS outcomes in patients with and without palate invasion. Occult metastasis was detected in 12 patients, and those with palate invasion exhibited nearly a one-fold increase in the risk of lymph node (LN) metastasis (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24–3.11) relative to those without palate invasion. Conclusion Palate invasion exerts a significantly adverse effect on both occult metastasis and overall prognosis. However, its influence on prognosis appears to be mitigated when elective neck dissection or elective neck irradiation is employed, suggesting a limited impact under these management strategies.","palate invasion in ct3/4 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma: a study of at least 5-year follow-up. background the prognostic significance of palate invasion in ct3/4n0 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (ms-scc) remains ambiguous. this study endeavors to elucidate the impact of palate invasion on the prognosis of ct3/4n0 ms-scc and to ascertain whether diverse neck management strategies modulate this effect. methods a retrospective analysis was undertaken on a cohort of patients with surgically managed ct3/4n0 ms-scc, all of whom had a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. the influence of palate invasion on locoregional control (lrc) and overall survival (os) was scrutinized using the cox proportional hazards model. additionally, the relationship between palate invasion and occult metastasis was evaluated through logistic regression analysis. results the study encompassed 133 patients, among whom 39 (29.3%) exhibited palate invasion. elective neck dissection was performed in 58 patients, while the remaining subjects received elective",palate invasion ct maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma least year follow prognostic significance palate invasion ct n maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma scc remain ambiguous endeavor elucidate impact palate invasion prognosis ct n scc ascertain whether diverse neck management strategy modulate effect retrospective undertake cohort surgically manage ct n scc minimum follow period year influence palate invasion locoregional control lrc overall survival scrutinize use cox proportional hazard model additionally relationship palate invasion occult metastasis evaluate logistic regression result encompass among exhibit palate invasion elective neck dissection perform remain subject receive elective,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Ultrasonography survey and thyroid cancer in the Fukushima Prefecture Thyroid cancer is one of the major health concerns after the accident in the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station (NPS). Currently, ultrasonography surveys are being performed for persons residing in the Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident with an age of up to 18 years. Here, the expected thyroid cancer prevalence in the Fukushima Prefecture is assessed based on an ultrasonography survey of Ukrainians, who were exposed at an age of up to 18 years to 131 I released during the Chernobyl NPS accident, and on differences in equip- ment and study protocol in the two surveys. Radiation risk of thyroid cancer incidence among survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and preliminary estimates of thyroid dose due to the Fukushima accident were used for the prediction of baseline and radiation- related thyroid cancer risks. We estimate a prevalence of thyroid cancer of 0.027 % (95 % CI 0.010 %; 0.050 %) for the first screening campaign in the Fukushima Prefecture. Compared with the incidence rate in Japan in 2007, the ultrasonography survey is predicted to increase baseline thyroid cancer incidence by a factor of 7.4 (95 % CI 0.95; 17.3). Under the condition of continued screening, thyroid cancer during the first fifty years after the accident is pre- dicted to be detected for about 2 % of the screened popu- lation. The prediction of radiation-related thyroid cancer in the most exposed fraction (a few ten thousand persons) of the screened population of the Fukushima Prefecture has a large uncertainty with the best estimates of the average risk of 0.1-0.3 %, depending on average dose.","ultrasonography survey and thyroid cancer in the fukushima prefecture thyroid cancer is one of the major health concerns after the accident in the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power station (nps). currently, ultrasonography surveys are being performed for persons residing in the fukushima prefecture at the time of the accident with an age of up to 18 years. here, the expected thyroid cancer prevalence in the fukushima prefecture is assessed based on an ultrasonography survey of ukrainians, who were exposed at an age of up to 18 years to 131 i released during the chernobyl nps accident, and on differences in equip- ment and study protocol in the two surveys. radiation risk of thyroid cancer incidence among survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and preliminary estimates of thyroid dose due to the fukushima accident were used for the prediction of baseline and radiation- related thyroid cancer risks. we estimate",ultrasonography survey thyroid fukushima prefecture thyroid one major health concern accident fukushima dai ichi nuclear power station nps currently ultrasonography survey perform person reside fukushima prefecture time accident age year expect thyroid prevalence fukushima prefecture assess base ultrasonography survey ukrainian expose age year release chernobyl nps accident difference equip ment protocol two survey radiation risk thyroid incidence among survivor atomic bombing hiroshima nagasaki preliminary estimate thyroid dose due fukushima accident use prediction baseline radiation relate thyroid risk estimate,e,Thyroid Cancer
"An invasive zone in human liver cancer identified by Stereo-seq promotes hepatocyte-tumor cell crosstalk, local immunosuppression and tumor progression. Dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and developing effective new treatments. Using a novel tumor border scanning and digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as ""the invasive zone"". We detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. We also identified a subpopulation of damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAAs) located close to the border on the paratumor side. Overexpression of CXCL6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway in nearby hepatocytes, which subsequently caused SAAs' overexpression in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression and secretion of SAAs by hepatocytes in the invasive zone could lead to the recruitment of macrophages and M2 polarization, further promoting local immunosuppression, potentially resulting in tumor progression. Clinical association analysis in additional five independent cohorts of patients with primary and secondary liver cancer (n = 423) showed that patients with overexpression of SAAs in the invasive zone had a worse prognosis. Further in vivo experiments using mouse liver tumor models in situ confirmed that the knockdown of genes encoding SAAs in hepatocytes decreased macrophage accumulation around the tumor border and delayed tumor growth. The identification and characterization of a novel invasive zone in human cancer patients not only add an important layer of understanding regarding the mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis, but may also pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for advanced liver cancer and other solid tumors.","an invasive zone in human liver cancer identified by stereo-seq promotes hepatocyte-tumor cell crosstalk, local immunosuppression and tumor progression. dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and developing effective new treatments. using a novel tumor border scanning and digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as ""the invasive zone"". we detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. we also identified a subpopulation of damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid a1 and a2 (referred to collectively as saas) located close to the border on the paratumor side. overexpression of cxcl6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce activation of the",invasive zone human liver identify stereo seq promote hepatocyte cell crosstalk local immunosuppression progression dissecting understand ecosystem especially around margin strong implication cell infiltration invasion essential explore mechanism metastasis develop effective new use novel border scanning digitization model enable nanoscale resolution spatial enhance resolution omics sequence stereo seq identify wide zone center around border liver refer invasive zone detect strong immunosuppression metabolic reprogramming severely damage hepatocytes zone also identify subpopulation damage hepatocytes increased expression serum amyloid refer collectively saas locate close border paratumor side overexpression cxcl adjacent malignant cell could induce activation,b,Liver Cancer
"Cancer Mortality and Long-Term Environmental Exposure of Cadmium in Contaminated Community Based on a Third Retrospective Cause of Death Investigation of Residents Living in the Guangdong Province from 2004 to 2005. This study compared the temporal and geographic trends of cancer in China with a specific focus on the long-term exposure to soil cadmium (Cd) pollution. The geographic information system (GIS; kriging interpolation method) was used to detect the Cd contained in the soil from the Dabaoshan area, Guangdong Province. The standard rate ratio (SRR) was calculated to describe the relationship between Cd exposure and cancer mortality risk using the low-exposure group as a reference. Eight hundred six cancer deaths (533 male and 273 female) in the total population of 972,970 were identified, and the age-standardized rate (world) was 145.64 per 100,000. Significant dose-response relationships were found using the low-exposure group as the reference group. The Cd soil levels were positively associated with the cancer mortality risk in the community population, particularly for all cancers (SRR = 3.27; 95% CI = 2.42–4.55), esophageal cancer (SRR = 5.42; 95% CI = 1.07–30.56), stomach cancer (SRR = 5.99; 95% CI = 2.00–18.66), liver cancer (SRR = 4.45; 95% CI = 2.16–10.34), and lung cancer (SRR = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.62–5.31) for the total population. Additionally, similar results were obtained when using the 2000 China standard population. Cd exposure significantly affected the standardized mortality rates (China) by age group for all cancers, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer in the total population, particularly in the age groups of 35–54, 55–74, and ≥ 75 years, respectively. Cd soil level is likely positively associated with increased cancer mortality of all cancer types and esophageal, stomach, liver, and lung cancers but not for other specific categories of cancer.","cancer mortality and long-term environmental exposure of cadmium in contaminated community based on a third retrospective cause of death investigation of residents living in the guangdong province from 2004 to 2005. this study compared the temporal and geographic trends of cancer in china with a specific focus on the long-term exposure to soil cadmium (cd) pollution. the geographic information system (gis; kriging interpolation method) was used to detect the cd contained in the soil from the dabaoshan area, guangdong province. the standard rate ratio (srr) was calculated to describe the relationship between cd exposure and cancer mortality risk using the low-exposure group as a reference. eight hundred six cancer deaths (533 male and 273 female) in the total population of 972,970 were identified, and the age-standardized rate (world) was 145.64 per 100,000. significant dose-response relationships were found using the low-exposure group as the reference group. the cd soil levels were",mortality long term environmental exposure cadmium contaminate community base third retrospective cause death investigation resident live guangdong province compare temporal geographic trend china specific focus long term exposure soil cadmium cd pollution geographic information system gi kriging interpolation method use detect cd contain soil dabaoshan area guangdong province standard rate ratio srr calculate describe relationship cd exposure mortality risk use low exposure group reference eight hundred six death male female total population identify age standardize rate world per significant dose response relationship find use low exposure group reference group cd soil level,d,Stomach Cancer
"Endoscopic resection of T1 colorectal cancer prior to surgery does not affect surgical adverse events and recurrence Although a “no-touch isolation” technique is used in colorectal cancer surgery to reduce the risk of metastatic induction, endoscopic resection (ER) prior to surgery may work against this aim. This study evaluated the effects of initial ER on short- and long-term outcomes in T1 colorectal cancer. This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with pathological T1 colorectal cancer who underwent colorectal surgical resection at a Japanese tertiary cancer center between 2002 and 2012. A total of 548 eligible patients were divided into two groups: patients initially treated using surgical resection with lymph node dissection (LND) (primary group, n = 304) and patients treated using initial ER and additional surgical resection with LND (secondary group, n = 244). The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method based on propensity score was used to compare postoperative complications and long-term recurrence. The incidence of postoperative complications with Clavien–Dindo classification grade ≥ II was 10.9% and 7.4% in the primary and secondary groups, respectively (p = 0.16). Multivariate analysis with a logistic proportional hazard regression model using IPTW revealed no significant differences in postoperative complications between the two groups (p = 0.79).

"Gastric cancer and diet. A pilot study on dietary habits in two districts differing markedly in respect of mortality from gastric cancer. THE mortality from gastric cancer is still conspicuously high in Ielancd, although some decline has been observed in recent years. Comparing standardized mortality rates for gastric cancer, 1960-61, in 24 countries, of which 16 were in Europe, Segi and Kurihara (1964) found by far the highest rates in Chile and Japan. For males the rates in these countries were 71-0 and 69-5 respectively per 100,000 and next in order came Austria and Finland with rates about 45 per 100,000. In Iceland the similarly standardized mortality rates, 1958-63, were 55-7 for males and 26-7 for females. For males the rate is distinctly higher than in any other country in Western Europe, but for females there is little difference between Iceland, Austria and Finland (Sigurjonsson, 1966a). It was suggested by Dungal (1961) that the unusual frequency and apparently uneven regional distribution of deaths from stomach cancer in Iceland might be related to consumption of smoked food such as meat, trout, salmon etc. Of known carcinogens, 3,4-benzopyrene was found in samples of smoked meat and trout together with other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as acenaphthy- lene, phenanthrene, fluorene and anthracene (Bailey and Dungal, 1958). Further, Dungal (1961) was able to produce malignant tumours in rats fed smoked mutton or trout. These tumours were generally of sarcomatous rather than carcinomatous nature and they appeared at various sites. Having these findings in mind a pilot study was planned to compare past dietary habits in two districts differing widely in respect of mortality from stomach cancer. The consumption of smoked food was to be given particular attention. The districts selected were Skagafjar6ars'sla (SKAG), in the northern part * Professor Niels Dungal died in October 1965, before the final draft of this paper had been prepared.","gastric cancer and diet. a pilot study on dietary habits in two districts differing markedly in respect of mortality from gastric cancer. the mortality from gastric cancer is still conspicuously high in ielancd, although some decline has been observed in recent years. comparing standardized mortality rates for gastric cancer, 1960-61, in 24 countries, of which 16 were in europe, segi and kurihara (1964) found by far the highest rates in chile and japan. for males the rates in these countries were 71-0 and 69-5 respectively per 100,000 and next in order came austria and finland with rates about 45 per 100,000. in iceland the similarly standardized mortality rates, 1958-63, were 55-7 for males and 26-7 for females. for males the rate is distinctly higher than in any other country in western europe, but for females there is little difference between iceland, austria and finland (sigurjonsson, 1966a). it was suggested by",gastric diet pilot dietary habit two district differ markedly respect mortality gastric mortality gastric still conspicuously high ielancd although decline observe recent year compare standardized mortality rate gastric country europe segi kurihara find far high rate chile japan male rate country respectively per next order come austria finland rate per iceland similarly standardized mortality rate male female male rate distinctly high country western europe female little difference iceland austria finland sigurjonsson suggest,d,Stomach Cancer
"Gender disparities in lung cancer incidence in the United States during 2001-2019. Lung cancer ranks as one of the top malignancies and the leading cause of cancer death in both males and females in the US. Using a cancer database covering the entire population, this study was to determine the gender disparities in lung cancer incidence during 2001-2019. Cancer patients were obtained from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The SEER*Stat software was applied to calculate the age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR). Temporal changes in lung cancer incidence were analyzed by the Joinpoint software. A total of 4,086,432 patients (53.3% of males) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Among them, 52.1% were 70 years or older, 82.7% non-Hispanic white, 39.7% from the South, and 72.6% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The AAIR of lung cancer continuously reduced from 91.0 per 100000 to 59.2 in males during the study period, while it increased from 55.0 in 2001 to 56.8 in 2006 in females, then decreased to 48.1 in 2019. The female to male incidence rate ratio of lung cancer continuously increased from 2001 to 2019. Gender disparities were observed among age groups, races, and histological types. In those aged 0-54 years, females had higher overall incidence rates of lung cancer than males in recent years, which was observed in all races (except non-Hispanic black), all regions, and adenocarcinoma and small cell (but not squamous cell). Non-Hispanic black females aged 0-54 years had a faster decline rate than males since 2013. API females demonstrated an increased trend during the study period. Lung cancer incidence continues to decrease with gender disparities among age groups, races, regions, and histological types. Continuous anti-smoking programs plus reduction of related risk factors are necessary to lower lung cancer incidence further.","gender disparities in lung cancer incidence in the united states during 2001-2019. lung cancer ranks as one of the top malignancies and the leading cause of cancer death in both males and females in the us. using a cancer database covering the entire population, this study was to determine the gender disparities in lung cancer incidence during 2001-2019. cancer patients were obtained from the national program of cancer registries (npcr) and surveillance, epidemiology and end results (seer) database. the seer*stat software was applied to calculate the age-adjusted incidence rates (aair). temporal changes in lung cancer incidence were analyzed by the joinpoint software. a total of 4,086,432 patients (53.3% of males) were diagnosed with lung cancer. among them, 52.1% were 70 years or older, 82.7% non-hispanic white, 39.7% from the south, and 72.6% non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). the aair of lung cancer continuously reduced from 91.0 per 100000 to 59.2",gender disparity lung incidence united state lung rank one top malignancy lead cause death male female u use database cover entire population determine gender disparity lung incidence obtain national program registry npcr surveillance epidemiology end result seer database seer stat software apply calculate age adjust incidence rate aair temporal change lung incidence analyze joinpoint software total male diagnose lung among year old non hispanic white south non small cell lung nsclc aair lung continuously reduce per,c,Lung Cancer
"The miR-487b-3p/GRM3/TGFβ signaling axis is an important regulator of colon cancer tumorigenesis Molecular targeting is an import strategy to treat advanced colon cancer. The current study demonstrates that expression of GRM3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly expressed in mammalian central nervous system, is significantly upregulated in majority of human colonic adenocarcinomas tested and colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GRM3 expression or inhibition of GRM3 activation in colon cancer cells reduces cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, GRM3 antagonizes TGFβ-mediated activation of protein kinase A and inhibition of Protein kinase B (AKT). In addition, TGFβ signaling increases GRM3 protein stability and knockdown of GRM3 enhances TGFβ-mediated tumor suppressor function. Further studies indicate that miR-487b-3p directly targets GRM3. Overexpression of miR-487b-3p mimics the effects of GRM3 knockdown and suppresses the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo. Expression of miR-487b-3p is decreased in colon adenocarcinomas and inversely correlates with GRM3 expression. Taken together, these studies indicate that upregulation of GRM3 expression is a functionally important molecular event in colon cancer, and that GRM3 is a promising molecular target for colon cancer treatment. This is particularly interesting and important from a therapeutic standpoint because numerous metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists are available, many of which have been found unsuitable for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders for reasons such as inability to readily penetrate blood brain barriers. As GRM3 is upregulated in colon cancer, but rarely expressed in normal peripheral tissues, targeting GRM3 with such agents would not likely cause adverse neurological or peripheral side effects, making GRM3 an attractive and specific molecular target for colon cancer treatment.","the mir-487b-3p/grm3/tgfβ signaling axis is an important regulator of colon cancer tumorigenesis molecular targeting is an import strategy to treat advanced colon cancer. the current study demonstrates that expression of grm3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly expressed in mammalian central nervous system, is significantly upregulated in majority of human colonic adenocarcinomas tested and colon cancer cell lines. knockdown of grm3 expression or inhibition of grm3 activation in colon cancer cells reduces cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. mechanistically, grm3 antagonizes tgfβ-mediated activation of protein kinase a and inhibition of protein kinase b (akt). in addition, tgfβ signaling increases grm3 protein stability and knockdown of grm3 enhances tgfβ-mediated tumor suppressor function. further studies indicate that mir-487b-3p directly targets grm3. overexpression of mir-487b-3p mimics the effects of grm3 knockdown and suppresses the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo. expression of mir-487b-3p is decreased in",mir b p grm tgf signal axis important regulator colon tumorigenesis molecular targeting import strategy treat advanced colon current demonstrate expression grm metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly express mammalian central nervous system significantly upregulated majority human colonic adenocarcinoma test colon cell line knockdown grm expression inhibition grm activation colon cell reduce cell survival anchorage independent growth vitro inhibits growth vivo mechanistically grm antagonizes tgf mediate activation protein kinase inhibition protein kinase b akt addition tgf signal increase grm protein stability knockdown grm enhances tgf mediate suppressor function indicate mir b p directly target grm overexpression mir b p mimic effect grm knockdown suppress tumorigenicity colon cell vivo expression mir b p decrease,a,Colon Cancer
"Thyroid cancer: incidence and mortality trends in China, 2005–2015 Understanding secular trends of thyroid cancer is critical to plan strategies for cancer prevention and control. Our aim was to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer in China during 2005–2015. A retrospective cohort evaluation of thyroid cancer cases and deaths during 2005–2015 was performed using population-based data from the Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report. The incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were stratified by gender, age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14…80–84, 85–), and area (urban or rural). A Joinpoint regression model was used to examine secular trends. In China, the age-standardized incidence was 3.21/105 in 2005, and increased to 9.61/105 in 2015. Besides, a significant increase incidence rate was observed with the average annual percent change (AAPC) of 12.4% (95% CI: 10.5%–14.4%) in the period 2005–2015. The age-standardized mortality was 0.30/105 in 2005 and 0.35/105 in 2015, and the AAPC was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3%–4.5%). For both incidence and mortality, the rates of thyroid cancer were much higher in females than in males, and in urban areas rather than rural areas; however, the rates of increasing trends showed no significant differences. With respect to the highest age-specific rates, it appeared in the age group of 50–54 years old for incidence and in the age group of 80–84 years old for mortality. Notably, the rate of increasing incidence trend was lower in older age groups, especially for people aged 70–79 years old. A rapid increase in incidence and a moderate increase in mortality of thyroid cancer were observed from 2005 to 2015 in our study. Effective measures and tailored programs should be taken to curb the growth trend and reduce the disease burden.","thyroid cancer: incidence and mortality trends in china, 2005–2015 understanding secular trends of thyroid cancer is critical to plan strategies for cancer prevention and control. our aim was to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer in china during 2005–2015. a retrospective cohort evaluation of thyroid cancer cases and deaths during 2005–2015 was performed using population-based data from the chinese cancer registry annual report. the incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were stratified by gender, age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14…80–84, 85–), and area (urban or rural). a joinpoint regression model was used to examine secular trends. in china, the age-standardized incidence was 3.21/105 in 2005, and increased to 9.61/105 in 2015. besides, a significant increase incidence rate was observed with the average annual percent change (aapc) of 12.4% (95% ci: 10.5%–14.4%) in the period 2005–2015. the age-standardized mortality was 0.30/105 in 2005 and 0.35/105 in 2015,",thyroid incidence mortality trend china understanding secular trend thyroid critical plan strategy prevention control estimate incidence mortality trend thyroid china retrospective cohort evaluation thyroid death perform use population base data chinese registry annual report incidence mortality rate thyroid stratify gender age group area urban rural joinpoint regression model use examine secular trend china age standardize incidence increase besides significant increase incidence rate observe average annual percent change aapc ci period age standardize mortality,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Identification of the active substances and mechanisms of ginger for the treatment of colon cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking Colon cancer is occurring at an increasing rate and ginger (Zingiber officinale), as a commonly used herbal medicine, has been suggested as a potential agent for colon cancer. This study was aimed to identify the bioactive components and potential mechanisms of ginger for colon cancer prevention by an integrated network pharmacology approach. The putative ingredients of ginger and its related targets were discerned from the TCMSP  and Swiss target prediction database. After that, the targets interacting with colon cancer were collected using Genecards, OMIM, and Drugbank databases. KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis were performed to explore the signaling pathways related to ginger for colon cancer treatments. The PPI and compound-target-disease networks were constructed using Cytoscape 3.8.1. Finally, Discovery studio software was employed to confirm the key genes and active components from ginger. Six potential active compounds, 285 interacting targets in addition to 1356 disease-related targets were collected, of which 118 intersection targets were obtained. A total of 34 key targets including PIK3CA, SRC, and TP53 were identified through PPI network analysis. These targets were mainly focused on the biological processes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, cellular response to oxidative stress, and cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus. The KEGG enrichment manifested that three signaling pathways were closely related to colon cancer prevention of ginger, cancer, endocrine resistance, and hepatitis B pathways. TP53, HSP90AA1, and JAK2 were viewed as the most important genes, which were validated by molecular docking simulation. This study demonstrated that ginger produced preventive effects against colon cancer by regulating multi-targets and multi-pathways with multi-components. And, the combined data provide novel insight for ginger compounds developed as new drug for anti-colon cancer.","identification of the active substances and mechanisms of ginger for the treatment of colon cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking colon cancer is occurring at an increasing rate and ginger (zingiber officinale), as a commonly used herbal medicine, has been suggested as a potential agent for colon cancer. this study was aimed to identify the bioactive components and potential mechanisms of ginger for colon cancer prevention by an integrated network pharmacology approach. the putative ingredients of ginger and its related targets were discerned from the tcmsp and swiss target prediction database. after that, the targets interacting with colon cancer were collected using genecards, omim, and drugbank databases. kegg pathway and go enrichment analysis were performed to explore the signaling pathways related to ginger for colon cancer treatments. the ppi and compound-target-disease networks were constructed using cytoscape 3.8.1. finally, discovery studio software was employed to confirm the key genes",identification active substance mechanism ginger colon base network pharmacology molecular docking colon occur increase rate ginger zingiber officinale commonly use herbal medicine suggest potential agent colon identify bioactive component potential mechanism ginger colon prevention integrated network pharmacology approach putative ingredient ginger related target discern tcmsp swiss target prediction database target interact colon collect use genecards omim drugbank database kegg pathway go enrichment perform explore signaling pathway relate ginger colon treatments ppi compound target network construct use cytoscape finally discovery studio software employ confirm key gene,a,Colon Cancer
"Mass-like Dieulafoy's lesion associated with advanced gastric cancer at the antrum of stomach: a case report and literature review. Dieulafoy’s lesion, also known as a caliber-persistent artery, is a shallow, small, and rare lesion that occurs along the lesser curvature of proximal stomach. It is rare for a Dieulafoy’s lesion to present as a mass-like lesion that coexists with gastric cancer. To our best knowledge, we report the first case and histopathological pictures of a mass-like Dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer in the antrum of the stomach. A 57-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of intermittent epigastric dull pain and dyspepsia. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a friable mass that was located between the distal antrum and the pyloric ring. Biopsy revealed it to be an intestinal type adenocarcinoma. Subtotal gastrectomy was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Grossly, a large irregular plaque-like tumor lesion was noted at the anterior wall of the distal antrum and pylorus ring near the lesser curvature, measuring 5.6 × 4.8 × 1.0 cm. Histopathological examination of the resected stomach revealed that the plaque-like lesion largely consisted of numerous abnormally large-caliber and tortuous arteries in the submucosa. The increased fibrosis of the submucosa resulted in the formation of elevated plaque. The intestinal type adenocarcinoma was noted to be largely confined to the mucosa layer, with focal submucosal and muscular propria involvement. The patient was discharged one week after the subtotal gastrectomy, and she was alive and well 17 months after discharge, with no major complications. This is the first case of a mass-like Dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer at the distal antrum area. This case highlights the possibility of life-threatening gastric bleeding after mucosal resection or biopsy that could be encountered by endoscopists.","mass-like dieulafoy's lesion associated with advanced gastric cancer at the antrum of stomach: a case report and literature review. dieulafoy’s lesion, also known as a caliber-persistent artery, is a shallow, small, and rare lesion that occurs along the lesser curvature of proximal stomach. it is rare for a dieulafoy’s lesion to present as a mass-like lesion that coexists with gastric cancer. to our best knowledge, we report the first case and histopathological pictures of a mass-like dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer in the antrum of the stomach. a 57-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of intermittent epigastric dull pain and dyspepsia. subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a friable mass that was located between the distal antrum and the pyloric ring. biopsy revealed it to be an intestinal type adenocarcinoma. subtotal gastrectomy was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. grossly, a large irregular plaque-like tumor lesion was noted at the",mass like dieulafoy lesion associate advanced gastric antrum stomach report literature review dieulafoy lesion also know caliber persistent artery shallow small rare lesion occur along less curvature proximal stomach rare dieulafoy lesion present mass like lesion coexist gastric best knowledge report first histopathological picture mass like dieulafoy lesion coexist advanced gastric antrum stomach year old female present month history intermittent epigastric dull pain dyspepsia subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveal friable mass locate distal antrum pyloric ring biopsy reveal intestinal type adenocarcinoma subtotal gastrectomy perform neoadjuvant chemotherapy grossly large irregular plaque like lesion note,d,Stomach Cancer

"Retrospective Evaluation of Bone Metastases in Patients With Thyroid Malignancy: A Single-Center Experience. Background Thyroid cancer is one of the five most common cancers causing bone metastasis. If there is an increase in serum thyroglobulin-antithyroglobulin levels in differentiated thyroid cancer or calcitonin levels in medullary thyroid cancer, patients should be evaluated for recurrence and distant metastasis. The skeleton is the second most common site of distant metastasis in thyroid cancer after the lung. Bone metastases cause pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression, severely reducing the quality of life. They are associated with poor prognosis. Bone metastases severely reduce the quality of life. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer with bone metastases diagnosed at our center. Methodology A total of 1,390 patients diagnosed with thyroid malignancy at our center between 2010 and 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. The study included 27 patients with differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer who had bone metastases. Results Of 27 patients, 19 (70.4%) had differentiated and eight (29.6%) had medullary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer constituted 22.2% (<i>n</i> = 6) and follicular thyroid cancer constituted 14.8% (<i>n</i> = 4) of the cases. Papillary carcinoma follicular variant, oncocytic, and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer were diagnosed with similar frequency, each accounting for 11.1% (<i>n</i> = 3). It was found that vertebrae were most commonly involved, followed by the pelvis, sternum, costae, femur and patella, shoulder and humerus, cranium, and scapula. The five-year survival rate was 72%, and the 10-year survival rate was 53%. Conclusions The number of patients with papillary cancer was the highest, but the rate of bone metastases was the lowest in this group. The highest rate of bone metastases was found in patients with poorly differentiated, oncocytic, medullary, follicular, and papillary cancer, respectively. The results obtained in this study reveal the necessity and importance of bone metastasis evaluation in patients with thyroid cancer.","retrospective evaluation of bone metastases in patients with thyroid malignancy: a single-center experience. background thyroid cancer is one of the five most common cancers causing bone metastasis. if there is an increase in serum thyroglobulin-antithyroglobulin levels in differentiated thyroid cancer or calcitonin levels in medullary thyroid cancer, patients should be evaluated for recurrence and distant metastasis. the skeleton is the second most common site of distant metastasis in thyroid cancer after the lung. bone metastases cause pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression, severely reducing the quality of life. they are associated with poor prognosis. bone metastases severely reduce the quality of life. this study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer with bone metastases diagnosed at our center. methodology a total of 1,390 patients diagnosed with thyroid malignancy at our center between 2010 and 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. the study included 27 patients with",retrospective evaluation bone metastasis thyroid malignancy single center experience thyroid one five common cause bone metastasis increase serum thyroglobulin antithyroglobulin level differentiated thyroid calcitonin level medullary thyroid evaluate recurrence distant metastasis skeleton second common site distant metastasis thyroid lung bone metastases cause pain fracture spinal cord compression severely reduce quality life associate poor prognosis bone metastases severely reduce quality life retrospectively evaluate diagnosis follow thyroid bone metastasis diagnose center methodology total diagnose thyroid malignancy center review retrospectively include,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Molecular detection of thyroglobulin mRNA transcripts in peripheral blood of patients with thyroid disease by RT-PCR The sensitive detection of circulating tumour cells in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer may precede the detection of relapse by other diagnostic studies – such as serum thyroglobulin – and thus may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications. We performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on blood samples from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease using two different RT-PCR sensitivities. Additionally, tissue specificity of TG mRNA-expression was determined using RNA extracts from 27 different human tissues. The lower limit of detection was 50–100 TG mRNA producing cells/ml blood using a ‘normal’ RT-PCR sensitivity and 10–20 cells/ml blood using a ‘high’ sensitivity. With the normal sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 9/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 63/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 21/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 9/50 controls. With the high sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 11/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 111/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 61/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 41/50 controls. Interestingly, using the normal RT-PCR sensitivity TG mRNA transcripts are specific for thyroid tissue and detectable in the peripheral blood of controls and patients with thyroid disease, which correlates with a diagnosis of metastasized thyroid cancer. However, with a high RT-PCR sensitivity, TG mRNA expression was found not to be specific for thyroid tissue and was not correlated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients. As a consequence, to date TG mRNA detected by RT-PCR in the peripheral blood cannot be recommended as a tumour marker superior to TG serum-level. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign","molecular detection of thyroglobulin mrna transcripts in peripheral blood of patients with thyroid disease by rt-pcr the sensitive detection of circulating tumour cells in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer may precede the detection of relapse by other diagnostic studies – such as serum thyroglobulin – and thus may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications. we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) on blood samples from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease using two different rt-pcr sensitivities. additionally, tissue specificity of tg mrna-expression was determined using rna extracts from 27 different human tissues. the lower limit of detection was 50–100 tg mrna producing cells/ml blood using a ‘normal’ rt-pcr sensitivity and 10–20 cells/ml blood using a ‘high’ sensitivity. with the normal sensitivity tg mrna was detected in 9/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 63/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 21/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 9/50",molecular detection thyroglobulin mrna transcript peripheral blood thyroid rt pcr sensitive detection circulate cell differentiated thyroid may precede detection relapse diagnostic serum thyroglobulin thus may important therapeutic prognostic implication perform reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr blood sample diagnose thyroid use two different rt pcr sensitivity additionally tissue specificity tg mrna expression determine use rna extract different human tissue low limit detection tg mrna produce cell ml blood use normal rt pcr sensitivity cell ml blood use high sensitivity normal sensitivity tg mrna detect thyroid metastasis history thyroid metastasis non malignant thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Genomic instability and colon cancer. Colorectal cancer affected ∼135,000 people in the United States in 2001, resulting in 57,000 deaths. At the cellular level, colorectal cancer results from the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells to colon adenocarcinoma cells. The loss of genomic stability appears to be a key molecular and pathogenetic step that occurs early in the tumorigenesis process and serves to create a permissive environment for the occurrence of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. At least three forms of genomic instability have been identified in colon cancer: (1) microsatellite instability (MSI), (2) chromosome instability (i.e. aneusomy, gains and losses of chromosomal regions) (CIN), and (3) chromosomal translocations. Microsatellite instability occurs in ∼15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the mutation mismatch repair (MMR) system by either MMR gene mutations or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. MSI promotes tumorigenesis through generating mutations in target genes that possess coding microsatellite repeats, such as TGFBR2 and BAX. CIN is found in the majority of colon cancers and leads to a different pattern of gene alterations that contribute to tumor formation. CIN appears to result primarily from deregulation of the DNA replication checkpoints and mitotic-spindle checkpoints. The mechanisms that induce and influence genomic instability in cancer in general and more specifically in colon cancer are only partly understood and are consequently under intense investigation. These studies have revealed mutation of the mitotic checkpoint regulators BUB1 and BUBR1 and amplification of STK15 in a subset of CIN colon cancers. The etiology of CIN in the other unexplained cases of colon cancer remains to be determined. Hopefully, discovery of the cause and specific role of genomic instability in colon cancer will yield more effective chemotherapy strategies that take advantage of this unique characteristic of cancer cells.","genomic instability and colon cancer. colorectal cancer affected ∼135,000 people in the united states in 2001, resulting in 57,000 deaths. at the cellular level, colorectal cancer results from the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells to colon adenocarcinoma cells. the loss of genomic stability appears to be a key molecular and pathogenetic step that occurs early in the tumorigenesis process and serves to create a permissive environment for the occurrence of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. at least three forms of genomic instability have been identified in colon cancer: (1) microsatellite instability (msi), (2) chromosome instability (i.e. aneusomy, gains and losses of chromosomal regions) (cin), and (3) chromosomal translocations. microsatellite instability occurs in ∼15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the mutation mismatch repair (mmr) system by either mmr gene mutations or hypermethylation of the",genomic instability colon colorectal affect people united state result death cellular level colorectal result progressive accumulation genetic epigenetic alteration lead transformation normal colonic epithelial cell colon adenocarcinoma cell loss genomic stability appear key molecular pathogenetic step occur early tumorigenesis process serf create permissive environment occurrence alteration suppressor gene oncogene least three form genomic instability identify colon microsatellite instability msi chromosome instability e aneusomy gain loss chromosomal region cin chromosomal translocation microsatellite instability occur colon result inactivation mutation mismatch repair mmr system either mmr gene mutation hypermethylation,a,Colon Cancer
"Bilateral metastatic ovarian tumors (Krukenberg’s tumors) in the course of stomach cancer Presented is a rare case of bilateral neoplastic metastases to the ovaries (Krukenberg's tumors) and to the fundus of the uterus which occurred in the course of stomach cancer in a 46-year-old female who was treated surgically in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Regional Hospital in Slupsk. The patient was admitted secondary to bilateral ovarian masses. Her past medical history included peptic ulcer disease for a few years, confirmed by gastroscopic biopsy in July of 2000. The surgery performed in our department revealed bilateral ovarian tumors, each measuring about 10 cm in diameter, which were completely removed along with the fundus of the uterus. The intraoperative histologic diagnosis was ovarian cancer. No other macroscopic neoplastic changes were found during the surgery. During surgical removal of the gastrocolic ligament a group of enlarged lymph nodes at the greater curvature of the stomach in the proximity of the spleen was incidentally noticed. The intraoperative histology of the lymph nodes described metastatic neoplasia. Another intraoperative biopsy was also performed of the stomach because of atypical clinical presentation of the ovarian cancer. The pathologic diagnosis was stomach cancer. Upon the consultation with pathologists it was concluded that the primary tumor came from the stomach while the changes in the ovaries and lymph nodes were metastatic. Thus, the surgery consisted of total hysterectomy as well as removal of the stomach along with the spleen, gastrocolic ligament and greater omentum. The distal esophagus was anastomosed with the loop of jejunum. The final result of histologic exam confirmed the location of the primary neoplastic tumor in the stomach with metastases to both ovaries, the body of uterus, and lymph nodes at the greater curvature of the stomach.","bilateral metastatic ovarian tumors (krukenberg’s tumors) in the course of stomach cancer presented is a rare case of bilateral neoplastic metastases to the ovaries (krukenberg's tumors) and to the fundus of the uterus which occurred in the course of stomach cancer in a 46-year-old female who was treated surgically in the department of obstetrics and gynecology of the regional hospital in slupsk. the patient was admitted secondary to bilateral ovarian masses. her past medical history included peptic ulcer disease for a few years, confirmed by gastroscopic biopsy in july of 2000. the surgery performed in our department revealed bilateral ovarian tumors, each measuring about 10 cm in diameter, which were completely removed along with the fundus of the uterus. the intraoperative histologic diagnosis was ovarian cancer. no other macroscopic neoplastic changes were found during the surgery. during surgical removal of the gastrocolic ligament a group of enlarged lymph nodes at",bilateral metastatic ovarian krukenberg course stomach present rare bilateral neoplastic metastasis ovary krukenberg fundus uterus occur course stomach year old female treat surgically department obstetrics gynecology regional hospital slupsk admit secondary bilateral ovarian mass past medical history include peptic ulcer year confirm gastroscopic biopsy july surgery perform department reveal bilateral ovarian measure cm diameter completely remove along fundus uterus intraoperative histologic diagnosis ovarian macroscopic neoplastic change find surgery surgical removal gastrocolic ligament group enlarged lymph node,d,Stomach Cancer
"Amputation neuroma mimicking lymph node metastasis of remnant gastric cancer: a case report. Amputation neuromas (ANs) are reactive hyperplasia of nerve tissues that occur after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves. Only two previous reports of ANs occurring around the stomach and post gastrectomy have been reported. We report the case of a patient with AN near the remnant stomach who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. A 76-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy, D1+ lymphadenectomy, and Billroth-I reconstruction for early gastric cancer in another hospital at 63 years of age. A regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow-up examination after gastrectomy revealed an ulcerative lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach, which was diagnosed as remnant gastric cancer based on the histopathological examination. Then, he was transferred to our hospital. An upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopy revealed an 18-mm Type 0-IIc lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach with an estimated depth within the mucosa (T1a). An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) failed to detect the primary lesion; however, a slightly enhanced 13 × 10-mm nodule was detected near the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach. An endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the nodule showed no cancer cell; thus, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the remnant gastric cancer was performed. Histopathological examination revealed noncurative resection due to T1b2 and UL (+). We planned an additional surgical resection. Before the resection, CT was performed, which had a 3-month interval with a previous CT, showing an enlargement of the nodule to 16 × 12 mm. We diagnosed the nodule as a lymph node metastasis and performed resection of the remnant stomach, D2 lymphadenectomy, splenectomy, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The nodule was later diagnosed as AN based on the histopathological examination. There was no residual cancer in the resected specimen. We report AN mimicking lymph node metastasis near the remnant stomach of a patient with remnant gastric cancer. When nodules appear in the previous operative field, the possibility of ANs should be considered, although the incidence may be quite low.","amputation neuroma mimicking lymph node metastasis of remnant gastric cancer: a case report. amputation neuromas (ans) are reactive hyperplasia of nerve tissues that occur after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves. only two previous reports of ans occurring around the stomach and post gastrectomy have been reported. we report the case of a patient with an near the remnant stomach who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. a 76-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy, d1+ lymphadenectomy, and billroth-i reconstruction for early gastric cancer in another hospital at 63 years of age. a regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow-up examination after gastrectomy revealed an ulcerative lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach, which was diagnosed as remnant gastric cancer based on the histopathological examination. then, he was transferred to our hospital. an upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopy revealed an 18-mm type 0-iic lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant",amputation neuroma mimic lymph node metastasis remnant gastric report amputation neuroma reactive hyperplasia nerve tissue occur trauma surgery involve peripheral nerve two previous report occur around stomach post gastrectomy report report near remnant stomach underwent distal gastrectomy gastric year old man underwent distal gastrectomy lymphadenectomy billroth reconstruction early gastric another hospital year age regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow examination gastrectomy reveal ulcerative lesion less curvature remnant stomach diagnose remnant gastric base histopathological examination transfer hospital upper gastrointestinal series endoscopy reveal mm type iic lesion less curvature remnant,d,Stomach Cancer
"Single-cell analysis uncovers liver susceptibility to pancreatic cancer metastasis via myeloid cell characterization. The liver is the predominant metastatic site for diverse cancers, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (CRC), etc. The high incidence of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer is an important reason for its refractory and high mortality. Therefore, it is important to understand how metastatic pancreatic cancer affects the hepatic tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in patients. Here, we characterized the TME of liver metastases unique to pancreatic cancer by comparing them with CRC liver metastases. We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets including tumor samples of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis (P-LM), colorectal cancer liver metastasis (C-LM), primary pancreatic cancer (PP), primary colorectal cancer (PC), as well as samples of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC), adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (NPT), to better characterize the heterogeneities of the microenvironment of two kinds of liver metastases. We next performed comparative analysis on cellular compositions between P-LM and C-LM, found that Mph_SPP1, a subset of macrophages associated with angiogenesis and tumor invasion, was more enriched in the P-LM group, indicating this kind of macrophages provide a TME niche more vulnerable for pancreatic cancers. Analysis of the developmental trajectory implied that Mph_SPP1 may progressively be furnished with increased expression of genes regulating endothelium. Cell-cell communications analysis revealed that Mph_SPP1 potentially interacts with endothelial cells in P-LM via FN1/SPP1-ITGAV/ITGB1, implying this macrophage subset may construct an immunosuppressive TME for pancreatic cancer by regulating endothelial cells. We also found that Mph_SPP1 has a prognostic value in pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is not present in colon adenocarcinoma or rectum adenocarcinoma. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the characteristics of the hepatic TME in patients with liver metastatic cancer. And it provides a subset of macrophages specifically associated with the liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and its detection and intervention have potential value for preventing the metastasis of pancreatic cancer to the liver.","single-cell analysis uncovers liver susceptibility to pancreatic cancer metastasis via myeloid cell characterization. the liver is the predominant metastatic site for diverse cancers, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (crc), etc. the high incidence of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer is an important reason for its refractory and high mortality. therefore, it is important to understand how metastatic pancreatic cancer affects the hepatic tumor immune microenvironment (tme) in patients. here, we characterized the tme of liver metastases unique to pancreatic cancer by comparing them with crc liver metastases. we integrated two single-cell rna-seq (scrna-seq) datasets including tumor samples of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis (p-lm), colorectal cancer liver metastasis (c-lm), primary pancreatic cancer (pp), primary colorectal cancer (pc), as well as samples of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (pbmc), adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (npt), to better characterize the heterogeneities of the microenvironment of two kinds of liver metastases. we next performed comparative analysis",single cell uncovers liver susceptibility pancreatic metastasis via myeloid cell characterization liver predominant metastatic site diverse include pancreatic colorectal crc etc high incidence hepatic metastasis pancreatic important reason refractory high mortality therefore important understand metastatic pancreatic affect hepatic immune microenvironment tme characterize tme liver metastasis unique pancreatic compare crc liver metastases integrate two single cell rna seq scrna seq datasets include sample pancreatic liver metastasis p lm colorectal liver metastasis c lm primary pancreatic pp primary colorectal pc well sample peripheral blood mono nuclear cell pbmc adjacent normal pancreatic tissue npt well characterize heterogeneity microenvironment two kind liver metastasis next perform comparative,b,Liver Cancer

"Variation in Adequate Lymph Node Yield for Gastric, Lung, and Bladder Cancer: Attributable to the Surgeon, Pathologist, or Hospital? The Commission on Cancer recently released quality-of-care measures regarding adequate lymphadenectomy for colon, gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. There is currently little information regarding variation in adequate lymph node yield (ALNY) for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. The New York State Cancer Registry and Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System were queried for stage I–III gastric, stage I–II lung, and stage II–III bladder cancer resections from 2004 to 2014. Hierarchical models assessed factors associated with ALNY (gastric ≥ 15; lung ≥ 10; bladder ≥ 2). Additionally, the proportions of variation attributable to surgeons, pathologists, and hospitals were estimated among Medicare patients. Among 3716 gastric, 18,328 lung, and 1512 bladder cancer resections, there were low rates of ALNY (gastric = 53%, lung = 36%, bladder = 67%). When comparing 2004–2006 and 2012–2014, there was significant improvement in ALNY for gastric cancer (39% vs. 68%), but more modest improvement for lung (33% vs. 38%) and bladder (65% vs. 71%) cancer. Large provider-level variation existed for each organ system. After controlling for patient-level factors/variation, the majority of variation was attributable to hospitals (gastric: surgeon = 4%, pathologist = 2.8%, hospital = 40%; lung: surgeon = 13.8%, pathologist = 1.5%, hospital = 18.3%) for gastric and lung cancer. For bladder cancer, most of the variation was attributable to pathologists (surgeon = 3.3%, pathologist = 10.5%, hospital = 6.2%). ALNY rates are low for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer, with only modest improvement over time for lung and bladder cancer. Given that the proportion of variation attributable to the surgeon, pathologist, and hospital is different for each organ system, future quality improvement initiatives should target the underlying causes, which vary by individual organ system.","variation in adequate lymph node yield for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer: attributable to the surgeon, pathologist, or hospital? the commission on cancer recently released quality-of-care measures regarding adequate lymphadenectomy for colon, gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. there is currently little information regarding variation in adequate lymph node yield (alny) for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. the new york state cancer registry and statewide planning and research cooperative system were queried for stage i–iii gastric, stage i–ii lung, and stage ii–iii bladder cancer resections from 2004 to 2014. hierarchical models assessed factors associated with alny (gastric ≥ 15; lung ≥ 10; bladder ≥ 2). additionally, the proportions of variation attributable to surgeons, pathologists, and hospitals were estimated among medicare patients. among 3716 gastric, 18,328 lung, and 1512 bladder cancer resections, there were low rates of alny (gastric = 53%, lung = 36%, bladder = 67%). when comparing 2004–2006 and 2012–2014,",variation adequate lymph node yield gastric lung bladder attributable surgeon pathologist hospital commission recently release quality care measure regard adequate lymphadenectomy colon gastric lung bladder currently little information regard variation adequate lymph node yield alny gastric lung bladder new york state registry statewide planning research cooperative system query stage iii gastric stage ii lung stage ii iii bladder resection hierarchical model assess factor associate alny gastric lung bladder additionally proportion variation attributable surgeon pathologist hospital estimate among medicare among gastric lung bladder resection low rate alny gastric lung bladder comparing,c,Lung Cancer

Overall, 499 of 891 and 1020 of 1353 patients with right-side and left-side colon cancer, respectively, had high NLN. In right-side colon cancer, patients with high NLN (≥ 27) had superior OS (74.9% vs. 62.7%, P &lt;  0.001) and RFS (75.0% vs. 61.9%, P &lt;  0.001) than did those with low NLN. Moreover, in left-side colon cancer, patients with high NLN (≥12) experienced significantly superior OS (80.8% vs. 68.6%, P &lt;  0.001) and RFS (77.3% vs. 66.2%, P &lt;  0.001) than did those with low NLN. Among the different subgroups of stage III colon cancer, the high NLN group showed significantly superior RFS and OS in stage IIIB (RFS: 77.0% vs. 68.0%, P = 0.001; OS: 78.6% vs. 67.9%, P &lt;  0.001) and IIIC (RFS: 58.2% vs. 44.1%, P = 0.001; OS: 65.7% vs. 51.1%, P &lt;  0.001) colon cancer.

"Feasibility of esophageal reconstruction using a pedicled jejunum with intrathoracic esophagojejunostomy in the upper mediastinum for esophageal cancer. An alternative conduit is needed when the gastric tube cannot be used as an esophageal substitute for reconstruction after esophagectomy. We adopted pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis in the upper mediastinum under such circumstances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. Two hundred and ten patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction from 1998 to 2013. Among them, 6 patients underwent colon interposition (colon group) and 13 underwent jejunum reconstruction (jejunum group) including 8 thoracoscopic anastomosis. The operative results of both groups were compared with those of 191 gastric tube reconstructions (stomach group). The operative times in the colon and jejunum groups were significantly longer than that in the stomach group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively). The colon group showed more operative blood loss and more frequent anastomotic leakage and ischemic stenosis of the conduit than did the stomach group (1605 vs. 530 g, P = 0.007; 50 vs. 12.6 %, P = 0.035; 16.7 vs. 0 %, P = 0.03, respectively). There was no anastomotic leakage, conduit necrosis and mortality in the jejunum group. Ischemic stenosis of the conduit occurred more frequently in jejunum group than in the stomach group (23.1 vs. 0 %, P < 0.001). However, the stenosis could be managed safely with endoscopic treatment. Patient survival in the colon and jejunum groups was consistent with that in the stomach group. Pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis can be performed safely under thoracotomy or thoracoscopic surgery when stomach cannot be used as an esophageal substitute after esophagectomy.","feasibility of esophageal reconstruction using a pedicled jejunum with intrathoracic esophagojejunostomy in the upper mediastinum for esophageal cancer. an alternative conduit is needed when the gastric tube cannot be used as an esophageal substitute for reconstruction after esophagectomy. we adopted pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis in the upper mediastinum under such circumstances. the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. two hundred and ten patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction from 1998 to 2013. among them, 6 patients underwent colon interposition (colon group) and 13 underwent jejunum reconstruction (jejunum group) including 8 thoracoscopic anastomosis. the operative results of both groups were compared with those of 191 gastric tube reconstructions (stomach group). the operative times in the colon and jejunum groups were significantly longer than that in the stomach group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.018, respectively). the colon group showed more",feasibility esophageal reconstruction use pedicled jejunum intrathoracic esophagojejunostomy upper mediastinum esophageal alternative conduit need gastric tube cannot use esophageal substitute reconstruction esophagectomy adopt pedicle jejunal reconstruction intrathoracic anastomosis upper mediastinum circumstance evaluate feasibility technique two hundred ten esophageal underwent esophagectomy reconstruction among underwent colon interposition colon group underwent jejunum reconstruction jejunum group include thoracoscopic anastomosis operative result group compare gastric tube reconstruction stomach group operative time colon jejunum group significantly long stomach group p p respectively colon group show,d,Stomach Cancer
