"Surgery of colon cancer in a district hospital Colorectal cancer is a common illness and continues even today to be the second cause of death in the U.S.A., after lung cancer. Although the incidence of gastric and pancreatic cancer has declined dramatically in recent years, the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased. The aim of our study is to present our experience and results of surgical techniques applied in our clinic for the treatment of colorectal cancer and its complications. We present our experience in treating colorectal cancer for the five-year period of 2006–2010 during which 49 patients were treated with colorectal cancer in our clinic, of whom 28 were men, with a mean age of 62 years and 21 were women, with a mean age of 66 years. In 15 cases, the cancerous lesion involved the rectum and in 34 the remaining colon. In 2 patients, concomitant cancer was found at a separate site within the bowel. In the first case, the tumour was found both in the caecum and high up in the rectum, while in the second case, cancer was found both within the transverse and the sigmoid colon. Six of our patients suffered from co-existing biliary lithiasis and thus underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy and in one of these patients a simultaneous bile duct exploration for common bile duct lithiasis was performed. In 15 of our patients, the malignant lesion was situated in the rectum and 8 of these patients underwent abdominoperineal resection while 7 had a low anterior resection. In 11 patients, the lesion was found in the sigmoid, 8 of whom had a Hartmann procedure and 3 a sigmoidectomy. In 5 patients who presented with cancer in the descending colon and in one with cancer in the splenic flexure, a left hemicolectomy was performed. In 3 patients, the lesion involved the right colic flexure, in 3 the ascending colon, in 6 the caecum and in 2 the vermiform appendix at its base; these 14 patients underwent a right hemicolectomy. The remaining 3 patients had cancer located in the transverse colon and underwent a resection of the transverse colon. Twenty-eight of the patients with colonic cancer were operated on an emergency basis. There were 2 postoperative deaths due to septic shock and multiple organ failure. In total we noted 7 complications, all of which concerned patients who had undergone emergency surgery. The length of hospital stay was between 8 and 14 days. Four of the patients with stage IV disease died two years after surgery; the remainder are still alive. We conclude that colorectal cancer continues to occur after the sixth decade with male predominance; its main localization is within the rectum and the sigmoid colon. The high complication rate of obstructive ileus in our region indicates inadequate access of the public to diagnostic facilities in our area. Despite this, the mortality level remains low.","surgery of colon cancer in a district hospital colorectal cancer is a common illness and continues even today to be the second cause of death in the u.s.a., after lung cancer. although the incidence of gastric and pancreatic cancer has declined dramatically in recent years, the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased. the aim of our study is to present our experience and results of surgical techniques applied in our clinic for the treatment of colorectal cancer and its complications. we present our experience in treating colorectal cancer for the five-year period of 2006–2010 during which 49 patients were treated with colorectal cancer in our clinic, of whom 28 were men, with a mean age of 62 years and 21 were women, with a mean age of 66 years. in 15 cases, the cancerous lesion involved the rectum and in 34 the remaining colon. in 2 patients, concomitant cancer was",surgery colon district hospital colorectal common illness continue even today second cause death u lung although incidence gastric pancreatic decline dramatically recent year incidence colorectal increase present experience result surgical technique apply clinic colorectal complication present experience treat colorectal five year period treat colorectal clinic men mean age year woman mean age year cancerous lesion involve rectum remain colon concomitant,a,Colon Cancer
"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Upregulates CXCR7 and Contributes to Chemotherapy Resistance in Colorectal Cancer. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates making it a focus of research. Chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality for colon cancer, but chemotherapy resistance severely impacts treatment efficacy. MIF has been found to promote tumor progression and resistance in various cancers. This study aims to investigate the role of MIF in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer and its potential mechanisms, particularly through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, affecting the metabolism and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells. The expression levels of MIF in colon cancer tissues and its association with patient prognosis were evaluated by analyzing TCGA and HPA data. Subsequently, the expression levels of MIF in colon cancer cell lines and resistant cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and the effect of MIF on oxaliplatin sensitivity was assessed. The impact of MIF on the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells was measured using a cellular energy metabolism analyzer. Further experiments explored the mechanism by which MIF affects the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, and the role of CTCF in regulating CXCR7 transcription was validated by silencing CTCF. Finally, the effect of MIF on drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells was verified in a mouse xenograft tumor model. In this study, we found that the expression of MIF in colon cancer tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues, and high MIF expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients. The expression levels of MIF in resistant colon cancer cell lines were significantly higher than in parental cell lines, and MIF overexpression significantly increased the resistance of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. Conversely, silencing MIF significantly reduced the IC50 value of resistant cells and increased apoptosis. MIF overexpression significantly increased the ECAR and OCR levels of colon cancer cells, while MIF knockdown significantly reduced these metabolic indicators. Further studies indicated that MIF affects the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells by upregulating CXCR7 expression. CTCF binding peaks at the CXCR7 promoter region and luciferase activity assays indicated that CTCF regulates CXCR7 transcription, and silencing CTCF significantly enhanced the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. In vivo experiments in mice showed that MIF silencing combined with oxaliplatin treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased the necrotic area of tumor tissues. In conclusion, this study reveals the crucial role of MIF in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, with CTCF playing an important regulatory role in this process. Our findings provide new theoretical insights and potential therapeutic targets for overcoming chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer. Future research should further explore the roles of MIF and CXCR7 in other types of cancers and the potential of MIF and CXCR7 as therapeutic targets.","macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) upregulates cxcr7 and contributes to chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer. colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates making it a focus of research. chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality for colon cancer, but chemotherapy resistance severely impacts treatment efficacy. mif has been found to promote tumor progression and resistance in various cancers. this study aims to investigate the role of mif in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer and its potential mechanisms, particularly through the upregulation of cxcr7 expression, affecting the metabolism and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells. the expression levels of mif in colon cancer tissues and its association with patient prognosis were evaluated by analyzing tcga and hpa data. subsequently, the expression levels of mif in colon cancer cell lines and resistant cell lines were detected by qrt-pcr and immunohistochemistry, and the effect",macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif upregulates cxcr contributes chemotherapy resistance colorectal colorectal one common malignant worldwide high incidence mortality rate make focus research chemotherapy primary modality colon chemotherapy resistance severely impact efficacy mif find promote progression resistance various investigate role mif chemotherapy resistance colon potential mechanism particularly upregulation cxcr expression affect metabolism drug sensitivity colon cell expression level mif colon tissue association prognosis evaluate analyze tcga hpa data subsequently expression level mif colon cell line resistant cell line detect qrt pcr immunohistochemistry effect,a,Colon Cancer
"Left-Sided Colon Cancer and Right-Sided Colon Cancer: Are They the Same Cancer or Two Different Entities? Background Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths. In Morocco, it occupies the first place among digestive cancers. Right-sided and left-sided colon cancers have different embryological, epidemiological, pathological, genetic, and clinical characteristics. This distinction leads to differences in the evolution and prognosis of the disease. This study aimed to identify epidemiological factors and clinical and pathological characteristics that can influence perioperative and prognostic outcomes in patients with right-sided colon cancer compared to those with left-sided colon cancer. Methodology We conducted a retrospective cohort study over a period of nine years from January 2012 until December 2020. We included 277 patients divided into two groups, namely, right colon cancer (group 1) (n = 99) and left colon cancer (group 2) (n = 178). Results The average age of our series was 57.4 years, with extremes ranging from 19 to 89 years old (SD = ±13.6451 years). The average age in the right colon group was 55.97 (SD = ±13.341 years). The average age in the left colon group was 58.18 (SD = ±13.69 years). The male gender had a predominance, with a sex ratio of 1.3 for both groups. Among the patients in group 2, 65% showed lymph node involvement on the CT scan, whereas only 34% of patients in group 1 displayed the same condition. The recurrence rate in the right-sided colon cancer group was 22.2% compared to 24.9% in the left-sided group. The five-year overall survival was estimated for the right-sided and left-sided colon cancer groups at 87% and 96.5%, respectively. In patients with stage III and IV cancer, overall survival was better for those who underwent surgery for left-sided colon cancer compared to those who underwent surgery for right-sided colon cancer (p = 0.029). In the case of vascular emboli or involvement of the perineural sheath, there was no significant difference in overall survival (p = 0.446 and p = 0.655, respectively). The three-month survival without recurrence was almost identical in both groups (31% for right-sided colon cancers and 30.9% for left-sided colon cancers). Age over 61 years was a predictive factor of poor prognosis in recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 3.245; p = 0.023). Conclusions We identified factors that can influence perioperative outcomes and prognosis in patients with right-sided colon cancer compared to those with left-sided colon cancer. Our findings suggest that age and lymph node involvement along with other factors play a role in the overall survival and recurrence outcomes of these patients. Further research is necessary to explore these differences and develop personalized treatment plans for patients with colon cancer.","left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer: are they the same cancer or two different entities? background colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths. in morocco, it occupies the first place among digestive cancers. right-sided and left-sided colon cancers have different embryological, epidemiological, pathological, genetic, and clinical characteristics. this distinction leads to differences in the evolution and prognosis of the disease. this study aimed to identify epidemiological factors and clinical and pathological characteristics that can influence perioperative and prognostic outcomes in patients with right-sided colon cancer compared to those with left-sided colon cancer. methodology we conducted a retrospective cohort study over a period of nine years from january 2012 until december 2020. we included 277 patients divided into two groups, namely, right colon cancer (group 1) (n = 99) and left colon cancer (group 2) (n",left sided colon right side colon two different entity colon one common world one main cause relate death morocco occupy first place among digestive right side leave side colon different embryological epidemiological pathological genetic characteristic distinction lead difference evolution prognosis identify epidemiological factor pathological characteristic influence perioperative prognostic outcome right side colon compare left side colon methodology conduct retrospective cohort period nine year january december include divide two group namely right colon group n leave colon group n,a,Colon Cancer
"Effect of Chemotherapy Treatment on Overall Survival of Colon Cancer Patients Using Propensity Score Matching. Background  Colon cancer is a common cause of cancer and cancer-associated deaths in the United States. Many factors can influence the overall survival (OS) of patients with colon cancer, such as patient demographics, clinical presentation, and treatment characteristics. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of chemotherapy on OS in patients with colon cancer with similar baseline characteristics.  Materials and methods  A total of 70,876 patients with stage II and III colon cancer, confirmed by pathology, over the age of 18, and who were diagnosed with colon cancer between 2004 and 2019, were selected from the de-identified National Cancer Database (NCDB). All of the patients included in the study underwent surgical treatment. Patients who received hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, palliative care, or any treatment modality besides chemotherapy were excluded from the analysis. Calculation of the propensity score was performed by computing the probability of patients being in the chemotherapy group using logistic regression. The propensity score matching (PSM) was done via the PSMATCH procedure with the SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) on patients who received chemotherapy compared to patients who received a treatment other than chemotherapy. The greedy nearest neighbor matching method was then utilized to match one chemotherapy patient to one non-chemotherapy patient with a caliper of 0.2. An exact match was done for sex, race, tumor stage, and year diagnosed at the time of patient diagnosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was then used to estimate the effect of chemotherapy on OS before and after PSM.  Results  A total of 70,876 patients were included in the study before PSM, with 44,992 receiving chemotherapy and 25,884 not receiving chemotherapy. Before PSM, the OS was 17.55 years for patients who received chemotherapy, compared to 14.12 years for those who did not. After matching 23,356 patients, the OS was 17.77 years for patients who received chemotherapy and 12.18 years for those who did not. Following PSM, patients who received chemotherapy were 46% less likely to die compared to those who did not receive chemotherapy. Conclusion  Our findings, per the PSM method, demonstrate that receiving chemotherapy can be a significant predictor of OS among patients with stage II and III colon cancer. Other variables such as tumor stage, age, and insurance type were also found to be significant predictors of OS in colon cancer patients. Prospective clinical studies are necessary and should be performed to determine the true effects of chemotherapy on OS.","effect of chemotherapy treatment on overall survival of colon cancer patients using propensity score matching. background colon cancer is a common cause of cancer and cancer-associated deaths in the united states. many factors can influence the overall survival (os) of patients with colon cancer, such as patient demographics, clinical presentation, and treatment characteristics. the goal of this study was to assess the influence of chemotherapy on os in patients with colon cancer with similar baseline characteristics. materials and methods a total of 70,876 patients with stage ii and iii colon cancer, confirmed by pathology, over the age of 18, and who were diagnosed with colon cancer between 2004 and 2019, were selected from the de-identified national cancer database (ncdb). all of the patients included in the study underwent surgical treatment. patients who received hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, palliative care, or any treatment modality besides chemotherapy were excluded from the",effect chemotherapy overall survival colon use propensity score match colon common cause associate death united state many factor influence overall survival colon demographic presentation characteristic goal assess influence chemotherapy colon similar baseline characteristic material method total stage ii iii colon confirm pathology age diagnose colon select de identified national database ncdb include underwent surgical receive hormonal therapy radiation therapy immunotherapy palliative care modality besides chemotherapy exclude,a,Colon Cancer
"Colorectal Cancer Characteristics Among Racial Minorities in the South Bronx: A 10-Year Retrospective Study at a Single Health Center. Background Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The incidence of colorectal cancer has increased with time. Over the last several decades, people of color and racial minorities living in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the United States, have suffered worse health outcomes than their White counterparts on virtually every health indicator. Aim To review the characteristics of patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of less than 50 and compare it to those who develop colorectal cancer more than or equal to the age of 50 years from a single health center in the South Bronx region. Methods We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study of patients who were followed from July 2011 to June 2021 at Bronx Care Health System. Patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in our health system were included in the study. Patients younger than 18 years of age, who were pregnant, or who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at other institutions were excluded. Results A total of 159 patients were included in the study. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common clinical presentation in 41 patients (25.8%), while iron deficiency anemia was the most common laboratory finding in 25 patients (15.7%). Sigmoid colon in 42 (26.4%) and ascending colon in 41 (25.8%) patients were the two most common locations of diagnosed colorectal cancers, and about 77 (48.4%) of the patients had stage 3 or 4 colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis. The result of our study highlights the importance of getting a colonoscopy for colon cancer screening done at the age of 45 years. Sigmoid and ascending colon were found to be the two most common locations of colorectal cancer in our patient population. Most of the patients who present with colon cancer at an early age present at an advanced stage. Close to 63 of the total 159 (39.6%) patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer had missed or declined their initial screening colonoscopy when offered. Conclusion Colon cancer is a common but mostly preventable disease, especially in people who are within the recommended age for screening colonoscopies. While gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia are generally the most common symptoms, we have observed that younger patients with colorectal cancer often show signs of weight loss and are typically diagnosed at more advanced stages when they seek medical care.","colorectal cancer characteristics among racial minorities in the south bronx: a 10-year retrospective study at a single health center. background colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased with time. over the last several decades, people of color and racial minorities living in the south bronx, the poorest congressional district in the united states, have suffered worse health outcomes than their white counterparts on virtually every health indicator. aim to review the characteristics of patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of less than 50 and compare it to those who develop colorectal cancer more than or equal to the age of 50 years from a single health center in the south bronx region. methods we conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study of patients who were followed from july 2011 to june",colorectal characteristic among racial minority south bronx year retrospective single health center colon one leading cause relate death worldwide incidence colorectal increase time last several decade people color racial minority live south bronx poor congressional district united state suffer bad health outcome white counterpart virtually every health indicator review characteristic belong racial ethnic minority diagnose colon age less compare develop colorectal equal age year single health center south bronx region method conduct single center retrospective observational follow july june,a,Colon Cancer

"Age and sex differences in the relationship of body weight changes with colon cancer risks: A nationwide cohort study. Colon cancer is a significant health concern, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. However, previous studies have mainly focused on assessing body weight as a risk factor for colon cancer at a specific time point. This nationwide cohort study investigated the association between body weight changes, which can fluctuate throughout an individual's lifespan, and the incidence of colon cancer using the South Korean population database provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Participants who underwent biennial health screenings between 2004 and 2006, and had follow-up health check-ups between 2014 and 2016, were included in this study. Body weight changes were categorized as follows: < 5%, decrease 5-20%, decrease > 20%, increase 5-20%, or > 20%. The primary outcome was the incidence of newly diagnosed colon cancer. Statistical analysis was used to examine the relationship between body weight changes and the incidence of colon cancer stratified according to age and sex. The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the cumulative incidence of colon cancer, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for confounding factors. The analysis included data from 10,332,397 individuals, with a mean (± SD) age of 45.5 ± 13.1 years, and 54.9% were male. In males with a body mass index (BMI) range of 18-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, both a weight gain of 5-20% (HR 1.07, P > z 0.01 [95% CI 1.02-1.13]) and weight gain > 20% (HR 1.27, P > z 0.03 [95% CI 1.03-1.56]) were associated with an increased risk for colon cancer. In addition, males < 40 years of age exhibited a higher risk for colon cancer with > 20% weight gain (HR 1.65, P > z < 0.001 [95% CI 1.18-2.30]). Whereas, females within the BMI range of 18-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who exhibited > 20% weight loss demonstrated a reduced risk (HR 0.77, P > z 0.04 [95% CI 0.60-0.98]). Moreover, females ≥ 40 years of age, who experienced weight loss > 20%, exhibited a decreased risk for colon cancer (HR 0.76; P > 0.02 [95% CI 0.60-0.96]). This nationwide cohort study demonstrated a relationship between body weight changes and the incidence of colon cancer, with differences based on sex and age. In particular, avoiding weight gain is crucial for males < 40 years of age, whereas weight loss could be beneficial for females > 40 years of age in reducing the risk of colon cancer.","age and sex differences in the relationship of body weight changes with colon cancer risks: a nationwide cohort study. colon cancer is a significant health concern, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. however, previous studies have mainly focused on assessing body weight as a risk factor for colon cancer at a specific time point. this nationwide cohort study investigated the association between body weight changes, which can fluctuate throughout an individual's lifespan, and the incidence of colon cancer using the south korean population database provided by the national health insurance service (nhis). participants who underwent biennial health screenings between 2004 and 2006, and had follow-up health check-ups between 2014 and 2016, were included in this study. body weight changes were categorized as follows: 20%, increase 5-20%, or > 20%. the primary outcome was the incidence of newly diagnosed colon cancer. statistical analysis was used to examine the relationship between",age sex difference relationship body weight change colon risk nationwide cohort colon significant health concern obesity well establish risk factor however previous mainly focus assess body weight risk factor colon specific time point nationwide cohort investigate association body weight change fluctuate throughout individual lifespan incidence colon use south korean population database provide national health insurance service nhis participant undergo biennial health screening follow health check ups include body weight change categorize follow increase primary outcome incidence newly diagnose colon statistical use examine relationship,a,Colon Cancer
"Plasma fatty acids and risk of colon and rectal cancers in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Fatty acid composition in plasma captures both dietary intake and endogenous synthesis. Prospective analyses of plasma fatty acid composition are needed to establish the role of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on risk of developing colorectal cancer. To evaluate associations between plasma fatty acid composition and colon or rectal cancer risk separately, a nested case-control study of 350 colorectal (211 colon and 139 rectal) cancer cases and an equal number of individually matched control subjects was conducted within the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a cohort of 63,257 men and women recruited between 1993 and 1998. Fatty acids in pre-diagnostic plasma were quantified using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Conditional odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing highest to lowest quartiles are presented. For colon cancer, inverse associations were reported with higher essential PUFAs, α-linolenic acid (OR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.73; P;  trend = 0.005) and linoleic acid (OR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.82; P;  trend = 0.008). Higher desaturase activity in the n-6 PUFA synthesis pathway estimated by the arachidonic:linoleic acid ratio was associated with increased colon cancer risk (OR = 3.53; 95% CI: 1.82, 6.85; P;  trend = 0.006), whereas higher desaturase activity in the MUFA synthesis pathway estimated by the oleic:stearic acid ratio was associated with decreased colon cancer risk (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.92; P;  trend = 0.024). There was no significant association between the essential fatty acids or the desaturase indices and rectal cancer risk. Endogenous synthesis of arachidonic and oleic acids has an impact on colon cancer development. Higher consumption of “good fats,” or their natural creation by the body, may help protect people from colon cancer. Jian-Min Yuan from the University of Pittsburgh, USA, and colleagues used samples from the Singapore Chinese Health Study to examine fatty acids contained in blood plasma from 350 people who later developed colorectal cancer and an equal number of matched control individuals. They found that higher blood levels—which reflect dietary intake—of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids linolenic acid and α-linolenic acid were associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. So was oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat created by the body, whereas conversion of linolenic acid to another fatty acid called arachidonic acid boosted colon cancer risk. No effect was seen on rectal cancer risk. Diets rich in linolenic acid may help prevent colon cancer.","plasma fatty acids and risk of colon and rectal cancers in the singapore chinese health study. fatty acid composition in plasma captures both dietary intake and endogenous synthesis. prospective analyses of plasma fatty acid composition are needed to establish the role of monounsaturated fatty acids (mufas) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) on risk of developing colorectal cancer. to evaluate associations between plasma fatty acid composition and colon or rectal cancer risk separately, a nested case-control study of 350 colorectal (211 colon and 139 rectal) cancer cases and an equal number of individually matched control subjects was conducted within the singapore chinese health study, a cohort of 63,257 men and women recruited between 1993 and 1998. fatty acids in pre-diagnostic plasma were quantified using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. conditional odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) comparing highest to lowest quartiles are presented. for colon cancer, inverse associations were reported",plasma fatty acid risk colon rectal singapore chinese health fatty acid composition plasma capture dietary intake endogenous synthesis prospective plasma fatty acid composition need establish role monounsaturated fatty acid mufas polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas risk develop colorectal evaluate association plasma fatty acid composition colon rectal risk separately nested control colorectal colon rectal equal number individually match control subject conduct within singapore chinese health cohort men woman recruit fatty acid pre diagnostic plasma quantify use gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry conditional odds ratio confidence interval cis compare high low quartile present colon inverse association report,a,Colon Cancer
"Tumor derived exosomal ENTPD2 impair CD8+ T cell function in colon cancer through ATP-adenosine metabolism reprogramming. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Extracellular ATP-AMP-adenosine metabolism plays a pivotal role in modulating tumor immune responses. Previous studies have shown that the conversion of ATP to AMP is primarily catalysed by Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1/CD39), a widely studied ATPase, which is expressed in tumor-associated immune cells. However, the function of ATPases derived from tumor cells themselves remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of colon cancer cell-derived ATPases in the development and progression of colon cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Bioinformatic and tissue microarray analyses were performed to investigate the expression of ATPase family members in colon cancer. An ATP hydrolysis assay, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to determine the effects of ENTPD2 on the biological functions of colon cancer cells. Flow cytometric and RNA-seq analyses were used to explore the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Immunoelectron microscopy and western blotting were used to evaluate the expression of ENTPD2 in exosomes. Double-labelling immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to examine the expression of ENTPD2 in serum exosomes and colon cancer tissues.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We found that ENTPD2, rather than the well-known ATPase CD39, is highly expressed in cancer cells and is significantly positively associated with poor patient prognosis in patients with colon cancer. The overexpression of ENTPD2 in cancer cells augmented tumor progression in immunocompetent mice by inhibiting the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, ENTPD2 is localized primarily within exosomes. On the one hand, exosomal ENTPD2 reduces extracellular ATP levels, thereby inhibiting P2X7R-mediated NFATc1 nuclear transcription; on the other hand, it facilitates the increased conversion of ATP to adenosine, hence promoting adenosine-A2AR pathway activity. In patients with colon cancer, the serum level of exosomal ENTPD2 is positively associated with advanced TNM stage and high tumor invasion depth. Moreover, the level of ENTPD2 in the serum exosomes of colon cancer patients is positively correlated with the ENTPD2 expression level in paired colon cancer tissues, and the ENTPD2 level in both serum exosomes and tissues is significantly negatively correlated with the ENTPD2 expression level in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our study suggests that exosomal ENTPD2, originated from colon cancer cells, contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment by promoting ATP-adenosine metabolism.

"The effect of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status on oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy as in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer Colon cancer with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects reveals distinct clinical and pathologic features, including a better prognosis but reduced response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. A current standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic colon cancer uses capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), or continuous-infusion fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). This study investigated the effect of MMR status on the treatment outcomes for CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. We analyzed 171 patients who had been treated with CAPOX or FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon adenocarcinoma between February 2004 and July 2008. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgically resected tumor specimens. The microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using fluorescent dye-labeled primers specific to microsatellite loci. Tumors with MMR defect were defined as those demonstrating a loss of MMR protein expression (MMR-D) and/or a microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) genotype. In all, 75 patients (44%) received FOLFOX, and 96 patients (56%) received CAPOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. The incidence of colon cancer with MMR defect was 10/171 (6%). Colon cancers with MMR defect (MSI-H and/or MMR-D) are more commonly located in proximal to the splenic flexure (p = 0.03). The MMR status did not significantly influence the overall response (p = 0.95) to first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. According to the MMR status, there was no significant difference for PFS (p = 0.50) and OS (p = 0.47) in patients with recurrent or metastatic colon cancer treated with first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX. In colon cancers with MMR defect, there was no significant difference for PFS (p = 0.48) and OS (p = 0.56) between CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. However, in MMR intact, there was significant difference for OS between CAPOX and FOLFOX (p = 0.04). OS was significantly better in patients treated with CAPOX when compared to patients with FOLFOX. The MMR status does not predict the effect of oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy as 1st line in recurrent or metastatic colon cancers. CAPOX in the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic colon cancer with MMR intacts showed a superior OS compared with FOLFOX unlike colon cancer with MMR defects.","the effect of dna mismatch repair (mmr) status on oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy as in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer colon cancer with dna mismatch repair (mmr) defects reveals distinct clinical and pathologic features, including a better prognosis but reduced response to 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)-based chemotherapy. a current standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic colon cancer uses capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (capox), or continuous-infusion fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (folfox). this study investigated the effect of mmr status on the treatment outcomes for capox and folfox as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. we analyzed 171 patients who had been treated with capox or folfox as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon adenocarcinoma between february 2004 and july 2008. tumor expression of the mmr proteins, mlh1 and msh2, was detected by immunohistochemistry (ihc) in surgically resected tumor specimens. the microsatellite instability (msi) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification,",effect dna mismatch repair mmr status oxaliplatin base first line chemotherapy recurrent metastatic colon colon dna mismatch repair mmr defect reveals distinct pathologic feature include good prognosis reduced response fluorouracil fu base chemotherapy current standard recurrent metastatic colon use capecitabine plus oxaliplatin capox continuous infusion fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin folfox investigate effect mmr status outcomes capox folfox first line combination chemotherapy recurrent metastatic colon analyze treat capox folfox first line combination chemotherapy recurrent metastatic colon adenocarcinoma february july expression mmr proteins mlh msh detect immunohistochemistry ihc surgically resect specimens microsatellite instability msi analyze polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification,a,Colon Cancer
"Risk Factors, Clinical Manifestations and Treatment Outcomes of Colon Cancer Patients in National Guard Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Introduction; ; Colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and its incidence is increasing day by day. Provision of early management to cancer patients can lead to a good prognosis. Hence, we evaluated the risk factors, clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes for colon cancer patients in National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from January 2010 to December 2020 by comparing those results according to their age groups.; ; Methods; ; A retrospective cohort study was performed on 251 colon cancer patients who underwent a surgical procedure. The patients were divided into the following age groups: ≤ 50 (young), 51-60 and > 60 (old) years old. The demographic variables such as age and gender were collected. The results were classified into risk factors, clinical features and treatment outcomes. The comparison between different age groups was made using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. The data was stored in Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA) and analyzed using SPSS (IBM Corp, Armonk, USA).; ; Results; ; The results revealed that most patients were males and the median age for diagnosis was 58 years old. There were 15.1% of patients with a positive family history. Moreover, the most common anatomical position was the left side of the colon in all age groups. Most patients had moderately differentiated colon cancer in the histopathological diagnosis. Laparotomy was the most common procedure done to patients in all age groups. There was no difference between all age groups and the aggressiveness of colon cancer. Young patients (≤ 50 years) had a higher percentage to have 5-year recurrence rate (42 % vs 19% vs 25%, p-value  60 years) respectively. However, there was no association between all age groups and 5-year mortality rate (22% vs 9% vs 19%, p-value = 0.171).; ; Conclusion; ; In comparison to old patients (> 60 years), young patients (≤ 50 years) have a more rate of recurrent colon cancer. In relation to all age groups, there were no differences in terms of the aggressive presentation or 5-year mortality rates. In addition, it appears that there were some differences between our study results and worldwide results. This may be because of occupational, cultural and/or genetic variations. Further studies with a higher number of patients and multicenter data collection are highly recommended.","risk factors, clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes of colon cancer patients in national guard hospital in jeddah, saudi arabia. introduction; ; colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and its incidence is increasing day by day. provision of early management to cancer patients can lead to a good prognosis. hence, we evaluated the risk factors, clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes for colon cancer patients in national guard health affairs (ngha), jeddah, saudi arabia from january 2010 to december 2020 by comparing those results according to their age groups.; ; methods; ; a retrospective cohort study was performed on 251 colon cancer patients who underwent a surgical procedure. the patients were divided into the following age groups: ≤ 50 (young), 51-60 and > 60 (old) years old. the demographic variables such as age and gender were collected. the results were classified into risk factors, clinical features and treatment outcomes.",risk factor manifestation outcome colon national guard hospital jeddah saudi arabia colon third common worldwide incidence increase day day provision early management lead good prognosis hence evaluate risk factor manifestation outcome colon national guard health affair ngha jeddah saudi arabia january december compare result accord age group retrospective cohort perform colon undergo surgical procedure divide following age group young old year old demographic variable age gender collect result classify risk factor feature outcome,a,Colon Cancer
"Association between heavy metals and colon cancer: an ecological study based on geographical information systems in North-Eastern Iran Colorectal cancer has increased in Middle Eastern countries and exposure to environmental pollutants such as heavy metals has been implicated. However, data linking them to this disease are generally lacking. This study aimed to explore the spatial pattern of age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of colon cancer and its potential association with the exposure level of the amount of heavy metals existing in rice produced in north-eastern Iran. Cancer data were drawn from the Iranian population-based cancer registry of Golestan Province, north-eastern Iran. Samples of 69 rice milling factories were analysed for the concentration levels of cadmium, nickel, cobalt, copper, selenium, lead and zinc. The inverse distance weighting (IDW) algorithm was used to interpolate the concentration of this kind of heavy metals on the surface of the study area. Exploratory regression analysis was conducted to build ordinary least squares (OLS) models including every possible combination of the candidate explanatory variables and chose the most useful ones to show the association between heavy metals and the ASR of colon cancer. The highest concentrations of heavy metals were found in the central part of the province and particularly counties with higher amount of cobalt were shown to be associated with higher ASR of men with colon cancer. In contrast, selenium concentrations were higher in areas with lower ASR of colon cancer in men. A significant regression equation for men with colon cancer was found (F(4,137) = 38.304, P < .000) with an adjusted R2 of 0.77. The predicted ASR of men colon cancer was − 58.36 with the coefficients for cobalt = 120.33; cadmium = 80.60; selenium = − 6.07; nickel = − 3.09; and zinc = − 0.41. The association of copper and lead with colon cancer in men was not significant. We did not find a significant outcome for colon cancer in women. Increased amounts of heavy metals in consumed rice may impact colon cancer incidence, both positively and negatively. While there were indications of an association between high cobalt concentrations and an increased risk for colon cancer, we found that high selenium concentrations might instead decrease the risk. Further investigations are needed to clarify if there are ecological or other reasons for these discrepancies. Regular monitoring of the amount of heavy metals in consumed rice is recommended.","association between heavy metals and colon cancer: an ecological study based on geographical information systems in north-eastern iran colorectal cancer has increased in middle eastern countries and exposure to environmental pollutants such as heavy metals has been implicated. however, data linking them to this disease are generally lacking. this study aimed to explore the spatial pattern of age-standardized incidence rate (asr) of colon cancer and its potential association with the exposure level of the amount of heavy metals existing in rice produced in north-eastern iran. cancer data were drawn from the iranian population-based cancer registry of golestan province, north-eastern iran. samples of 69 rice milling factories were analysed for the concentration levels of cadmium, nickel, cobalt, copper, selenium, lead and zinc. the inverse distance weighting (idw) algorithm was used to interpolate the concentration of this kind of heavy metals on the surface of the study area. exploratory regression analysis was",association heavy metal colon ecological base geographical information system north eastern iran colorectal increase middle eastern country exposure environmental pollutant heavy metal implicate however data link generally lack explore spatial pattern age standardize incidence rate asr colon potential association exposure level amount heavy metal exist rice produce north eastern iran data draw iranian population base registry golestan province north eastern iran sample rice mill factory analyse concentration level cadmium nickel cobalt copper selenium lead zinc inverse distance weight idw algorithm use interpolate concentration kind heavy metal surface area exploratory regression,a,Colon Cancer
"Understanding the impact of colorectal cancer education: a randomized trial of health fairs Regular screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) reduces morbidity and mortality from this disease. A number of factors play a role in the underutilization of CRC screening; populations with the lowest CRC screening rates are least likely to be aware of the need for screening or have knowledge about screening options. The overall purpose of this project was to assess two methods for increasing knowledge about CRC in a health fair context: one, by using a health educator to provide CRC information at a table, or two, to provide a tour through a giant inflatable, walk-through colon model with physical depictions of healthy tissue, polyps, and CRC. We participated in six community health fair events, three were randomized to incorporate the use of the inflatable colon, and three used a standard display table method. We used a pre/post-design to look for changes in knowledge about CRC before and after participating in a health fair. We examined descriptive statistics of participants using frequencies and proportions. McNemar’s test for paired binary data was used to test whether there were significant differences in the distribution of correct answer percentage from pre to post and from pre to follow up. Linear regression (GEE) was used to investigate whether there was a significant difference in the change from pre- to post-intervention in the percentage of correct answers on knowledge of tests available to detect CRC and awareness of risk factors for CRC between participants at sites with the inflatable colon compared to participants at sites without the inflatable colon. Participants (n = 273) were recruited at the six health fairs. Participants in health fairs with the inflatable colon had higher knowledge at post-test than participants in health fairs with tabling activities, that is, without the inflatable colon; however, the difference was not significant. One month follow-up after each health fair showed virtually no recollection of information learned at the health fairs. The use of an inflatable colon may be an innovative way to help people learn about CRC and CRC screening; however, it is not significantly more effective than conventional table display methods. Further research is needed to associate intention to obtain screening after touring the inflatable colon with actual screening. Future research could explore ways to better retain knowledge at long-term follow-up.","understanding the impact of colorectal cancer education: a randomized trial of health fairs regular screening for colorectal cancer (crc) reduces morbidity and mortality from this disease. a number of factors play a role in the underutilization of crc screening; populations with the lowest crc screening rates are least likely to be aware of the need for screening or have knowledge about screening options. the overall purpose of this project was to assess two methods for increasing knowledge about crc in a health fair context: one, by using a health educator to provide crc information at a table, or two, to provide a tour through a giant inflatable, walk-through colon model with physical depictions of healthy tissue, polyps, and crc. we participated in six community health fair events, three were randomized to incorporate the use of the inflatable colon, and three used a standard display table method. we used a pre/post-design",understand impact colorectal education randomized trial health fair regular screen colorectal crc reduce morbidity mortality number factor play role underutilization crc screen population low crc screening rate least likely aware need screen knowledge screen option overall project assess two method increase knowledge crc health fair context one use health educator provide crc information table two provide tour giant inflatable walk colon model physical depiction healthy tissue polyp crc participate six community health fair event three randomize incorporate use inflatable colon three use standard display table method use pre post design,a,Colon Cancer
"Epistasis analysis of microRNAs on pathological stages in colon cancer based on an Empirical Bayesian Elastic Net method. Colon cancer is a leading cause of worldwide cancer death. It has become clear that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in the progress of colon cancer and understanding the effect of miRNAs on tumorigenesis could lead to better prognosis and improved treatment. However, most studies have focused on studying differentially expressed miRNAs between tumor and non-tumor samples or between stages in tumor tissue. Limited work has conducted to study the interactions or epistasis between miRNAs and how the epistasis brings about effect on tumor progression. In this study, we investigate the main and pair-wise epistatic effects of miRNAs on the pathological stages of colon cancer ﻿using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We develop a workflow composed of multiple steps for feature selection based on the Empirical Bayesian Elastic Net (EBEN) method. First, we identify the main effects using a model with only main effect on the phenotype. Second, a corrected phenotype is calculated by removing the significant main effect from the original phenotype. Third, we select features with epistatic effect on the corrected phenotype. Finally, we run the full model with main and epistatic effects on the previously selected main and epistatic features. Using the multi-step workflow, we identify a set of miRNAs with main and epistatic effect on the pathological stages of colon cancer. Many of miRNAs with main effect on colon cancer have been previously reported to be associated with colon cancer, and the majority of the epistatic miRNAs share common target genes that could explain their epistasis effect on the pathological stages of colon cancer. We also find many of the target genes of detected miRNAs are associated with colon cancer. Go Ontology Enrichment Analysis of the experimentally validates targets of main and epistatic miRNAs, shows that these target genes are enriched for biological processes associated with cancer progression. Our results provide a set of candidate miRNAs associated with colon cancer progression that could have potential translational and therapeutic utility. Our analysis workflow offers a new opportunity to efficiently explore epistatic interactions among genetic and epigenetic factors that could be associated with human diseases. Furthermore, our workflow is flexible and can be applied to analyze the main and epistatic effect of various genetic and epigenetic factors on a wide range of phenotypes.","epistasis analysis of micrornas on pathological stages in colon cancer based on an empirical bayesian elastic net method. colon cancer is a leading cause of worldwide cancer death. it has become clear that micrornas (mirnas) play a role in the progress of colon cancer and understanding the effect of mirnas on tumorigenesis could lead to better prognosis and improved treatment. however, most studies have focused on studying differentially expressed mirnas between tumor and non-tumor samples or between stages in tumor tissue. limited work has conducted to study the interactions or epistasis between mirnas and how the epistasis brings about effect on tumor progression. in this study, we investigate the main and pair-wise epistatic effects of mirnas on the pathological stages of colon cancer ﻿using datasets from the cancer genome atlas. we develop a workflow composed of multiple steps for feature selection based on the empirical bayesian elastic net (eben) method.",epistasis micrornas pathological stage colon base empirical bayesian elastic net method colon lead cause worldwide death become clear micrornas mirnas play role progress colon understand effect mirnas tumorigenesis could lead good prognosis improved however focus differentially express mirnas non sample stage tissue limit work conduct interaction epistasis mirnas epistasis bring effect progression investigate main pair wise epistatic effect mirnas pathological stage colon use datasets genome atlas develop workflow compose multiple step feature selection base empirical bayesian elastic net eben method,a,Colon Cancer

"Tumor size and origin determine the antitumor activity of cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil and its modulation by leucovorin in murine colon carcinomas. 5-Fluorouracil (FUra) is one of the few effective agents in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. Its effects on the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) can be modulated by leucovorin (LV) or cisplatin (CDDP). Tumor size and differentiation of tumor characteristics can influence therapeutic efficacy. We therefore studied the relationship between tumor size (cutoff point 200 mm3) and the antitumor activity of FUra and its modulation by LV in murine Colon 26 and Colon 38 tumors. The doubling time of tumors measuring >200 mm3 was about 160% longer. The antitumor effect of FUra in these large tumors was decreased and could not be modulated by LV. In addition, three subtypes of Colon 26 (Colon 26-A, Colon 26-B, and Colon 26-10) were identified and characterized for tumor-induced weight loss, TS activity, response to chemotherapy, and histological features. Mice bearing Colon 38 and Colon 26-10 did not lose weight as a result of tumor growth. Colon 26-A caused a weight loss of up to 19%, whereas mice with Colon 26-B tumors remained within 10% of their initial weight and tolerated at least 2.5 times more tumor load than did mice bearing Colon 26-A, which induces cachexia. Among untreated tumors, TS catalytic activity was highest in Colon 26-B (5536 pmol mg protein-1 h-1) and lowest in Colon 38 (799 pmol mg protein-1 h-1); Colon 26-A and Colon 26-10 had intermediate activities (about 2500 pmol mg protein-1 h-1). 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) binding was comparable in the three Colon 26 subtypes but was lower in Colon 38. The antitumor activity of FUra could be modulated by LV in Colon 38, Colon 26-10, and Colon 26-A but could not in Colon 26-B, with complete responses (CR) being obtained in Colon 26-10 and Colon 38. The latter two were highly sensitive to CDDP, followed by Colon 26-A and Colon 26-B (CRs: 50%, 40%, 25%, and 0, respectively). Furthermore, necrosis was noted in Colon 26-B and Colon 38 but not in Colon 26-A. In conclusion, (1) the antitumor activity of FUra in large tumors is decreased and cannot be modulated by LV and (2) characteristics and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics can vary substantially in closely related tumors of the same origin.","tumor size and origin determine the antitumor activity of cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil and its modulation by leucovorin in murine colon carcinomas. 5-fluorouracil (fura) is one of the few effective agents in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. its effects on the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (ts) can be modulated by leucovorin (lv) or cisplatin (cddp). tumor size and differentiation of tumor characteristics can influence therapeutic efficacy. we therefore studied the relationship between tumor size (cutoff point 200 mm3) and the antitumor activity of fura and its modulation by lv in murine colon 26 and colon 38 tumors. the doubling time of tumors measuring >200 mm3 was about 160% longer. the antitumor effect of fura in these large tumors was decreased and could not be modulated by lv. in addition, three subtypes of colon 26 (colon 26-a, colon 26-b, and colon 26-10) were identified and characterized for tumor-induced weight loss,",size origin determine antitumor activity cisplatin fluorouracil modulation leucovorin murine colon carcinoma fluorouracil fura one effective agent colorectal effect target enzyme thymidylate synthase modulate leucovorin lv cisplatin cddp size differentiation characteristic influence therapeutic efficacy therefore relationship size cutoff point mm antitumor activity fura modulation lv murine colon colon double time measure mm long antitumor effect fura large decrease could modulate lv addition three subtypes colon colon colon b colon identify characterize induce weight loss,a,Colon Cancer
"Consumption of red meat and processed meat and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. Red meat and processed meat consumption has been hypothesized to increase risk of cancer, but the evidence is inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to summarize the evidence of associations between consumption of red meat (unprocessed), processed meat, and total red and processed meat with the incidence of various cancer types. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through December 2020. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the highest versus the lowest category of red meat, processed meat, and total red and processed meat consumption in relation to incidence of various cancers. We identified 148 published articles. Red meat consumption was significantly associated with greater risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03–1.15), endometrial cancer (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01-1.56), colorectal cancer (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03–1.17), colon cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.09-1.25), rectal cancer (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46), lung cancer (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.09–1.44), and hepatocellular carcinoma (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46).

"Which is more important in the management of splenic flexure colon cancer: strict central lymph node dissection or adequate bowel resection margin? What qualifies as optimal lymph node (LN) dissection in the surgical management of splenic flexure colon cancer (SFCC) still remains controversial because few studies have evaluated the distribution of LN metastasis of SFCC. The aim of this study was to clarify detailed distribution of LN metastasis and long-term outcomes of SFCC. This retrospective study enrolled patients who had curative colectomy for primary transverse or descending colon cancer of pathological stage I, II, or III at a single high-volume cancer center between April 2002 and December 2018. The 538 eligible patients were divided into three groups: patients with SFCC (SFCC group, n = 168), patients with proximal transverse colon cancer (PTCC group, n = 290), and patients with distal descending colon cancer (DDCC group, n = 80). LNs were classified into horizontal (pericolic) and vertical (intermediate and main) nodes. Intermediate and main LN station numbers were defined according to the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum classification. Distributions of LN metastasis and long-term outcomes were compared. In the SFCC group, the mean age was 67.3 ± 10.5 years and 110 patients (65.5%) were male. The proportion of patients with LN metastasis in the intermediate or main region was significantly lower in the SFCC group (8%) than in the PTCC (37%) (p < 0.01) or DDCC group (29%) (p < 0.01) in pathological stage III patients. In the SFCC group, the incidence of pericolic LN metastasis on the oral side of tumor (43%) was significantly higher than in the PTCC group (21%) (p < 0.01) and was similar to that in the DDCC group (42%) (p = 0.51), while in the SFCC group, the incidence of pericolic LN metastasis on the anal side of tumor (17%) was lower than in the PTCC group (31%) and was also similar to that in the DDCC group (21%). There were no significant differences in disease-specific survival rates among all groups. LN metastasis occurred mainly in the pericolic region, especially on the oral side of the tumor in SFCC. It may, therefore, be important to have an adequate bowel resection margin, especially on the oral side, for SFCC.","which is more important in the management of splenic flexure colon cancer: strict central lymph node dissection or adequate bowel resection margin? what qualifies as optimal lymph node (ln) dissection in the surgical management of splenic flexure colon cancer (sfcc) still remains controversial because few studies have evaluated the distribution of ln metastasis of sfcc. the aim of this study was to clarify detailed distribution of ln metastasis and long-term outcomes of sfcc. this retrospective study enrolled patients who had curative colectomy for primary transverse or descending colon cancer of pathological stage i, ii, or iii at a single high-volume cancer center between april 2002 and december 2018. the 538 eligible patients were divided into three groups: patients with sfcc (sfcc group, n = 168), patients with proximal transverse colon cancer (ptcc group, n = 290), and patients with distal descending colon cancer (ddcc group, n = 80). lns were",important management splenic flexure colon strict central lymph node dissection adequate bowel resection margin qualify optimal lymph node ln dissection surgical management splenic flexure colon sfcc still remain controversial evaluate distribution ln metastasis sfcc clarify detailed distribution ln metastasis long term outcome sfcc retrospective enrol curative colectomy primary transverse descend colon pathological stage ii iii single high volume center april december eligible divide three group sfcc sfcc group n proximal transverse colon ptcc group n distal descend colon ddcc group n lns,a,Colon Cancer

"Translationally controlled tumour protein TCTP is induced early in human colorectal tumours and contributes to the resistance of HCT116 colon cancer cells to 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Translationally controlled tumour protein TCTP is an anti-apoptotic protein frequently overexpressed in cancers, where high levels are often associated with poor patient outcome. TCTP may be involved in protecting cancer cells against the cytotoxic action of anti-cancer drugs. Here we study the early increase of TCTP levels in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and the regulation of TCTP expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells, in response to treatment with the anti-cancer drugs 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Using immunohistochemistry, we assessed TCTP levels in surgical samples from adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon, compared to normal colon tissue. We also studied the regulation of TCTP in HCT116 colon cancer cells in response to 5-FU and oxaliplatin by western blotting. TCTP mRNA levels were assessed by RT-qPCR. We used mTOR kinase inhibitors to demonstrate mTOR-dependent translational regulation of TCTP under these conditions. Employing the Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) System and the MTS assay, we investigated the effect of TCTP-knockdown on the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to the anti-cancer drugs 5-FU and oxaliplatin. 1. TCTP levels are significantly increased in colon adenomas and adenocarcinomas, compared to normal colon tissue. 2. TCTP protein levels are about 4-fold upregulated in HCT116 colon cancer cells, in response to 5-FU and oxaliplatin treatment, whereas TCTP mRNA levels are down regulated. 3. mTOR kinase inhibitors prevented the up-regulation of TCTP protein, indicating that TCTP is translationally regulated through the mTOR complex 1 signalling pathway under these conditions. 4. Using two cellular assay systems, we demonstrated that TCTP-knockdown sensitises HCT116 cells to the cytotoxicity caused by 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Our results demonstrate that TCTP levels increase significantly in the early stages of CRC development. In colon cancer cells, expression of this protein is largely upregulated during treatment with the DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs 5-FU and oxaliplatin, as part of the cellular stress response. TCTP may thus contribute to the development of anti-cancer drug resistance. These findings indicate that TCTP might be suitable as a biomarker and that combinatorial treatment using 5-FU/oxaliplatin, together with mTOR kinase inhibitors, could be a route to preventing the development of resistance to these drugs.","translationally controlled tumour protein tctp is induced early in human colorectal tumours and contributes to the resistance of hct116 colon cancer cells to 5-fu and oxaliplatin. translationally controlled tumour protein tctp is an anti-apoptotic protein frequently overexpressed in cancers, where high levels are often associated with poor patient outcome. tctp may be involved in protecting cancer cells against the cytotoxic action of anti-cancer drugs. here we study the early increase of tctp levels in human colorectal cancer (crc) and the regulation of tctp expression in hct116 colon cancer cells, in response to treatment with the anti-cancer drugs 5-fu and oxaliplatin. using immunohistochemistry, we assessed tctp levels in surgical samples from adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon, compared to normal colon tissue. we also studied the regulation of tctp in hct116 colon cancer cells in response to 5-fu and oxaliplatin by western blotting. tctp mrna levels were assessed by rt-qpcr. we",translationally control protein tctp induce early human colorectal contributes resistance hct colon cell fu oxaliplatin translationally control protein tctp anti apoptotic protein frequently overexpressed high level often associate poor outcome tctp may involve protect cell cytotoxic action anti drug early increase tctp level human colorectal crc regulation tctp expression hct colon cell response anti drug fu oxaliplatin use immunohistochemistry assess tctp level surgical sample adenoma adenocarcinoma colon compare normal colon tissue also regulation tctp hct colon cell response fu oxaliplatin western blot tctp mrna level assess rt qpcr,a,Colon Cancer

Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1958-2002, including over 1.2 million first and multiple primary cancers and in situ tumours. Compared to previous versions, only 6.0% of deceased offspring with a cancer diagnosis lack any parental information. We show one application of the Database in the study of familial risks in colorectal adenocarcinoma, with defined age-group and anatomic site specific analyses. Familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were determined for offspring when parents or sibling were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. As a novel finding it was shown that risks for siblings were higher than those for offspring of affected parents. The excess risk was limited to colon cancer and particularly to right-sided colon cancer. The SIRs for colon cancer in age matched populations were 2.58 when parents were probands and 3.81 when siblings were probands; for right-sided colon cancer the SIRs were 3.66 and 7.53, respectively. Thus the familial excess (SIR-1.00) was more than two fold higher for right-sided colon cancer. Colon and rectal cancers appeared to be distinguished between high-penetrant and recessive conditions that only affect the colon, whereas low-penetrant familial effects are shared by the two sites. Epidemiological studies can be used to generate clinical estimates for familial risk, conditioned on numbers of affected family members and their ages of onset. Useful risk estimates have been developed for familial breast and prostate cancers. Reliable risk estimates for other cancers should also be seriously considered for routine clinical recommendations, because practically all cancers show a familial effect and the risks are high for some of the rare neoplasms. The implementation of a unified management plan for familial cancers at large will be a major challenge to the clinical genetic counselling community.","the swedish family-cancer database: update, application to colorectal cancer and clinical relevance the swedish family-cancer database has been used for almost 10 years in the study of familial risks at all common sites. in the present paper we describe some main features of version vi of this database, assembled in 2004. this update included all swedes born in 1932 and later (offspring) with their biological parents, a total of 10.5 million individuals. cancer cases were retrieved from the swedish cancer registry from 1958-2002, including over 1.2 million first and multiple primary cancers and in situ tumours. compared to previous versions, only 6.0% of deceased offspring with a cancer diagnosis lack any parental information. we show one application of the database in the study of familial risks in colorectal adenocarcinoma, with defined age-group and anatomic site specific analyses. familial standardized incidence ratios (sirs) were determined for offspring when parents or sibling",swedish family database update application colorectal relevance swedish family database use almost year familial risk common site present paper describe main feature version vi database assemble update include swede bear later offspring biological parent total million individual retrieve swedish registry include million first multiple primary situ compare previous version decease offspring diagnosis lack parental information show one application database familial risk colorectal adenocarcinoma defined age group anatomic site specific analyse familial standardized incidence ratio sir determine offspring parent sibling,a,Colon Cancer
"A transcriptome-based protein network that identifies new therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer. Colon cancer occurrence is increasing worldwide, making it the third most frequent cancer. Although many therapeutic options are available and quite efficient at the early stages, survival is strongly decreased when the disease has spread to other organs. The identification of molecular markers of colon cancer is likely to help understanding its course and, eventually, to uncover novel genes to be targeted by drugs. In this study, we compared gene expression in a set of 95 human colon cancer samples to that in 19 normal colon mucosae, focusing on 401 genes from 5 selected pathways (Apoptosis, Cancer, Cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein signaling, Drug metabolism, Wnt/beta-catenin). Deregulation of mRNA levels largely matched that of proteins, leading us to build in silico protein networks, starting from mRNA levels, to identify key proteins central to network activity. Among the analyzed genes, 10.5% (42) had no reported link with colon cancer, including the SFRP1, IGF1 and ADH1B (down), and MYC and IL8 (up), whose encoded proteins were most interacting with other proteins from the same or even distinct networks. Analyzing all pathways globally led us to uncover novel functional links between a priori unrelated or rather remotely connected pathways, such as the Drug metabolism and the Cancer pathways or, even more strikingly, between the Cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein signaling and the Cancer pathways. In addition, we analyzed the responsiveness of some of the deregulated genes essential to network activities, to chemotherapeutic agents used alone or in presence of Lovastatin, a lipid-lowering drug. Some of these treatments could oppose the deregulations occurring in cancer samples, including those of the CHECK2, CYP51A1, HMGCS1, ITGA2, NME1 or VEGFA genes. Our network-based approach allowed discovering genes not previously known to play regulatory roles in colon cancer. Our results also showed that selected drug treatments might revert the cancer-specific deregulation of genes playing prominent roles within the networks operating to maintain colon homeostasis. Among those genes, some could constitute novel testable targets to eliminate colon cancer cells, either directly or, potentially, through the use of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, in association with selected anticancer drugs.","a transcriptome-based protein network that identifies new therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer. colon cancer occurrence is increasing worldwide, making it the third most frequent cancer. although many therapeutic options are available and quite efficient at the early stages, survival is strongly decreased when the disease has spread to other organs. the identification of molecular markers of colon cancer is likely to help understanding its course and, eventually, to uncover novel genes to be targeted by drugs. in this study, we compared gene expression in a set of 95 human colon cancer samples to that in 19 normal colon mucosae, focusing on 401 genes from 5 selected pathways (apoptosis, cancer, cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein signaling, drug metabolism, wnt/beta-catenin). deregulation of mrna levels largely matched that of proteins, leading us to build in silico protein networks, starting from mrna levels, to identify key proteins central to network activity. among the analyzed genes,",transcriptome base protein network identify new therapeutic target colorectal colon occurrence increase worldwide make third frequent although many therapeutic option available quite efficient early stage survival strongly decrease spread organ identification molecular marker colon likely help understand course eventually uncover novel gene target drug compare gene expression set human colon sample normal colon mucosa focus gene select pathway apoptosis cholesterol metabolism lipoprotein signal drug metabolism wnt beta catenin deregulation mrna level largely match protein lead u build silico protein network start mrna level identify key protein central network activity among analyze gene,a,Colon Cancer
"Overexpression of peptide deformylase in breast, colon, and lung cancers Human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (PDF) has been proposed as a novel cancer therapeutic target. However, very little is known about its expression and regulation in human tissues. The purpose of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of PDF in cancerous tissues and to identify mechanisms that regulate its expression. The mRNA expression levels of PDF and methionine aminopeptidase 1D (MAP1D), an enzyme involved in a related pathway with PDF, were determined using tissue panels containing cDNA from patients with various types of cancer (breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovarian, prostate, or thyroid) and human cell lines. Protein levels of PDF were also determined in 2 colon cancer patients via western blotting. Colon cancer cells were treated with inhibitors of ERK, Akt, and mTOR signaling pathways and the resulting effects on PDF and MAP1D mRNA levels were determined by qPCR for colon and lung cancer cell lines. Finally, the effects of a PDF inhibitor, actinonin, on the proliferation of breast, colon, and prostate cell lines were determined using the CyQUANT assay. PDF and MAP1D mRNA levels were elevated in cancer cell lines compared to non-cancer lines. PDF mRNA levels were significantly increased in breast, colon, and lung cancer samples while MAP1D mRNA levels were increased in just colon cancers. The expression of PDF and MAP1D varied with stage in these cancers. Further, PDF protein expression was elevated in colon cancer tissue samples. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK, but not PI3K or mTOR, pathway reduced the expression of PDF and MAP1D in both colon and lung cancer cell lines. Further, inhibition of PDF with actinonin resulted in greater reduction of breast, colon, and prostate cancer cell proliferation than non-cancer cell lines. This is the first report showing that PDF is over-expressed in breast, colon, and lung cancers, and the first evidence that the MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in regulating the expression of PDF and MAP1D. The over-expression of PDF in several cancers and the inhibition of cancer cell growth by a PDF inhibitor suggest this enzyme may act as an oncogene to promote cancer cell proliferation.","overexpression of peptide deformylase in breast, colon, and lung cancers human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (pdf) has been proposed as a novel cancer therapeutic target. however, very little is known about its expression and regulation in human tissues. the purpose of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of pdf in cancerous tissues and to identify mechanisms that regulate its expression. the mrna expression levels of pdf and methionine aminopeptidase 1d (map1d), an enzyme involved in a related pathway with pdf, were determined using tissue panels containing cdna from patients with various types of cancer (breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovarian, prostate, or thyroid) and human cell lines. protein levels of pdf were also determined in 2 colon cancer patients via western blotting. colon cancer cells were treated with inhibitors of erk, akt, and mtor signaling pathways and the resulting effects on pdf and map1d mrna levels were determined by",overexpression peptide deformylase breast colon lung human mitochondrial peptide deformylase pdf propose novel therapeutic target however little know expression regulation human tissue characterize expression pattern pdf cancerous tissue identify mechanism regulate expression mrna expression level pdf methionine aminopeptidase map enzyme involve related pathway pdf determine use tissue panel contain cdna various type breast colon kidney liver lung ovarian prostate thyroid human cell line protein level pdf also determine colon via western blot colon cell treat inhibitor erk akt mtor signaling pathway resulting effect pdf map mrna level determine,a,Colon Cancer

"WDR5 supports colon cancer cells by promoting methylation of H3K4 and suppressing DNA damage KMT2/MLL proteins are commonly overexpressed or mutated in cancer and have been shown to support cancer maintenance. These proteins are responsible for methylating histone 3 at lysine 4 and promoting transcription and DNA synthesis; however, they are inactive outside of a multi-protein complex that requires WDR5. WDR5 has been implicated in cancer for its role in the COMPASS complex and its interaction with Myc; however, the role of WDR5 in colon cancer has not yet been elucidated. WDR5 expression was evaluated using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Cell viability and colony forming assays were utilized to evaluate the effects of WDR5 depletion or inhibition in colon cancer cells. Downstream effects of WDR5 depletion and inhibition were observed by western blot. WDR5 is overexpressed in colon tumors and colon cancer cell lines at the mRNA and protein level. WDR5 depletion reduces cell viability in HCT116, LoVo, RKO, HCT15, SW480, SW620, and T84 colon cancer cells. Inhibition of the WDR5:KMT2/MLL interaction using OICR-9429 reduces cell viability in the same panel of cell lines albeit not to the same extent as RNAi-mediated WDR5 depletion. WDR5 depletion reduced H3K4Me3 and increased phosphorylation of H2AX in HCT116, SW620, and RKO colon cancer cells; however, OICR-9429 treatment did not recapitulate these effects in all cell lines potentially explaining the reduced toxicity of OICR-9429 treatment as compared to WDR5 depletion. WDR5 depletion also sensitized colon cancer cells to radiation-induced DNA damage. These data demonstrate a clear role for WDR5 in colon cancer and future studies should examine its potential to serve as a therapeutic target in cancer. Additional studies are needed to fully elucidate if the requirement for WDR5 is independent of or consistent with its role within the COMPASS complex. OICR-9429 treatment was particularly toxic to SW620 and T84 colon cancer cells, two cell lines without mutations in WDR5 and KMT2/MLL proteins suggesting COMPASS complex inhibition may be particularly effective in tumors lacking KMT2 mutations. Additionally, the ability of WDR5 depletion to amplify the toxic effects of radiation presents the possibility of targeting WDR5 to sensitize cells to DNA-damaging therapies.","wdr5 supports colon cancer cells by promoting methylation of h3k4 and suppressing dna damage kmt2/mll proteins are commonly overexpressed or mutated in cancer and have been shown to support cancer maintenance. these proteins are responsible for methylating histone 3 at lysine 4 and promoting transcription and dna synthesis; however, they are inactive outside of a multi-protein complex that requires wdr5. wdr5 has been implicated in cancer for its role in the compass complex and its interaction with myc; however, the role of wdr5 in colon cancer has not yet been elucidated. wdr5 expression was evaluated using rt-qpcr and western blot analysis. cell viability and colony forming assays were utilized to evaluate the effects of wdr5 depletion or inhibition in colon cancer cells. downstream effects of wdr5 depletion and inhibition were observed by western blot. wdr5 is overexpressed in colon tumors and colon cancer cell lines at the mrna and protein",wdr support colon cell promote methylation h k suppress dna damage kmt mll protein commonly overexpressed mutate show support maintenance protein responsible methylating histone lysine promote transcription dna synthesis however inactive outside multi protein complex require wdr wdr implicate role compass complex interaction myc however role wdr colon yet elucidate wdr expression evaluate use rt qpcr western blot cell viability colony forming assay utilize evaluate effect wdr depletion inhibition colon cell downstream effect wdr depletion inhibition observe western blot wdr overexpressed colon colon cell line mrna protein,a,Colon Cancer

"Butyrate inhibits pro-proliferative miR-92a by diminishing c-Myc-induced miR-17-92a cluster transcription in human colon cancer cells Compromised colonic butyrate production resulting from low dietary fiber or altered gut microbiota may promote colon neoplasia. Previous reports indicate these actions are mediated in part by altered levels of miRNAs, including suppressed expression of the oncogenic miR-17-92a cluster. Here, we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying these effects of butyrate in colon cancer. miR-92a levels were measured in archived human colon cancer and adjacent normal colon specimens by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The effects of butyrate and other histone deacetylase inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid) on primary (pri-miR17-92a), precursor and mature miR-92a were analyzed in HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells using qPCR. The effects of butyrate, SAHA and valproic acid on protein levels of c-Myc, Drosha and p57 were measured in HCT-116 cells using immunoblotting. Regulation of C13orf25 promoter activity by butyrate was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay using modified pGL3 constructs containing a wild-type or mutated c-Myc binding site. Expression of c-Myc was modulated using siRNA or adenovirus vectors. p57 mRNA and protein were measured before and after transfection with miR-92a-mimic molecules. Following butyrate treatment and miR-92a-mimic transfection, apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 immunoblotting. Microarray, confirmed by qPCR, revealed a seven-fold increase in miR-92a levels in sporadic human colon cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal colon. Treating human colon cancer cells with butyrate reduced the levels of pri-miR17-92a, precursor and mature miR-92a, as well as c-Myc. SAHA and valproic acid had similar effects. Mutation of the c-Myc binding site diminished butyrate’s inhibitory effects on C13orf25 promoter activity. Silencing c-Myc expression reduced miR-92a levels. c-Myc over-expression neutralized butyrate-induced attenuation of pri-miR17-92a. Exogenous miR-92a inhibited butyrate-induced p57 expression and reversed the beneficial actions of butyrate on colon cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings identify a novel cellular mechanism whereby butyrate inhibits miR-92a transcription by reducing c-Myc, thus augmenting p57 levels. These actions diminish colon cancer cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis. This newly described regulation of oncogenic miRNA biogenesis expands our understanding of colon cancer cell biology and identifies novel therapeutic targets.","butyrate inhibits pro-proliferative mir-92a by diminishing c-myc-induced mir-17-92a cluster transcription in human colon cancer cells compromised colonic butyrate production resulting from low dietary fiber or altered gut microbiota may promote colon neoplasia. previous reports indicate these actions are mediated in part by altered levels of mirnas, including suppressed expression of the oncogenic mir-17-92a cluster. here, we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying these effects of butyrate in colon cancer. mir-92a levels were measured in archived human colon cancer and adjacent normal colon specimens by microarray and quantitative rt-pcr (qpcr). the effects of butyrate and other histone deacetylase inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha) and valproic acid) on primary (pri-mir17-92a), precursor and mature mir-92a were analyzed in hct-116 and ht-29 human colon cancer cells using qpcr. the effects of butyrate, saha and valproic acid on protein levels of c-myc, drosha and p57 were measured in hct-116 cells using immunoblotting. regulation of c13orf25",butyrate inhibits pro proliferative mir diminish c myc induce mir cluster transcription human colon cell compromise colonic butyrate production result low dietary fiber alter gut microbiota may promote colon neoplasia previous report indicate action mediate part altered level mirnas include suppressed expression oncogenic mir cluster seek identify mechanism underlie effect butyrate colon mir level measure archived human colon adjacent normal colon specimen microarray quantitative rt pcr qpcr effect butyrate histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid saha valproic acid primary pri mir precursor mature mir analyze hct ht human colon cell use qpcr effect butyrate saha valproic acid protein level c myc drosha p measure hct cell use immunoblotting regulation c orf,a,Colon Cancer
"Four cases of laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid colon and rectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon Persistent descending mesocolon (PDM) is a congenital anomaly associated with the failure of fixation of the descending colon to the lateral abdominal wall. In the laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer, it has been noticed that there are extensive adhesions and a distinctive anatomy of colonic vessels in cases with PDM. Therefore, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge about PDM so that it can be appropriately treated during surgery. Case 1—a 79-year-old man underwent laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for rectal cancer. Preoperative barium enema (BE) revealed that the sigmoid colon was located at the right side of the abdomen. An enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the common trunk of the left colic artery (LCA) and the first sigmoid colonic artery (S1) branched from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Case 2—a 68-year-old man underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer synchronously. BE showed that the descending colon ran from the splenic flexure to medial caudal side. An enhanced CT showed that the distance from the LCA to the marginal artery was 1.0 cm. Case 3—a 68-year-old man underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer. BE showed that the descending colon ran to the medial caudal side. An enhanced CT showed that the mesentery of the descending colon was comparatively shortened. Case 4—a 60-year-old man underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. An enhanced CT showed that the descending colon ran to the medial caudal side and predicted that the LCA and S1 formed a common trunk and branched radially from the IMA. We reported four cases with PDM recognized preoperatively as above. Three cases had a shortening of the mesocolon. While dissecting the vessels, although special attention was required to maintain the blood flow to the intestine, none of these cases developed any complications during the postoperative course. We considered that it is important to have positional awareness of the LCA and the marginal artery to perform the laparoscopic surgery safely when a colorectal cancer with PDM is diagnosed preoperatively using imaging methods.","four cases of laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid colon and rectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon persistent descending mesocolon (pdm) is a congenital anomaly associated with the failure of fixation of the descending colon to the lateral abdominal wall. in the laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer, it has been noticed that there are extensive adhesions and a distinctive anatomy of colonic vessels in cases with pdm. therefore, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge about pdm so that it can be appropriately treated during surgery. case 1—a 79-year-old man underwent laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for rectal cancer. preoperative barium enema (be) revealed that the sigmoid colon was located at the right side of the abdomen. an enhanced computed tomography (ct) showed that the common trunk of the left colic artery (lca) and the first sigmoid colonic artery (s1) branched from the inferior mesenteric artery (ima). case 2—a 68-year-old man underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy",four laparoscopic colectomy sigmoid colon rectal persistent descend mesocolon persistent descend mesocolon pdm congenital anomaly associate failure fixation descend colon lateral abdominal wall laparoscopic colectomy colorectal notice extensive adhesion distinctive anatomy colonic vessel pdm therefore necessary sufficient knowledge pdm appropriately treat surgery year old man underwent laparoscopic intersphincteric resection rectal preoperative barium enema reveal sigmoid colon locate right side abdomen enhanced computed tomography ct show common trunk left colic artery lca first sigmoid colonic artery branch inferior mesenteric artery ima year old man underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy,a,Colon Cancer

"Transcription factor expression as a predictor of colon cancer prognosis: a machine learning practice Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the USA and around the world. Molecular level characters, such as gene expression levels and mutations, may provide profound information for precision treatment apart from pathological indicators. Transcription factors function as critical regulators in all aspects of cell life, but transcription factors-based biomarkers for colon cancer prognosis were still rare and necessary. We implemented an innovative process to select the transcription factors variables and evaluate the prognostic prediction power by combining the Cox PH model with the random forest algorithm. We picked five top-ranked transcription factors and built a prediction model by using Cox PH regression. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we validated our predictive model on four independent publicly available datasets (GSE39582, GSE17536, GSE37892, and GSE17537) from the GEO database, consisting of 925 colon cancer patients. A five-transcription-factors based predictive model for colon cancer prognosis has been developed by using TCGA colon cancer patient data. Five transcription factors identified for the predictive model is HOXC9, ZNF556, HEYL, HOXC4 and HOXC6. The prediction power of the model is validated with four GEO datasets consisting of 1584 patient samples. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were conducted on both training and validation datasets, the difference of overall survival time between predicted low and high-risk groups can be clearly observed. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to further investigate the difference between low and high-risk groups in the gene pathway level. The biological meaning was interpreted. Overall, our results prove our prediction model has a strong prediction power on colon cancer prognosis. Transcription factors can be used to construct colon cancer prognostic signatures with strong prediction power. The variable selection process used in this study has the potential to be implemented in the prognostic signature discovery of other cancer types. Our five TF-based predictive model would help with understanding the hidden relationship between colon cancer patient survival and transcription factor activities. It will also provide more insights into the precision treatment of colon cancer patients from a genomic information perspective.","transcription factor expression as a predictor of colon cancer prognosis: a machine learning practice colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the usa and around the world. molecular level characters, such as gene expression levels and mutations, may provide profound information for precision treatment apart from pathological indicators. transcription factors function as critical regulators in all aspects of cell life, but transcription factors-based biomarkers for colon cancer prognosis were still rare and necessary. we implemented an innovative process to select the transcription factors variables and evaluate the prognostic prediction power by combining the cox ph model with the random forest algorithm. we picked five top-ranked transcription factors and built a prediction model by using cox ph regression. using kaplan-meier analysis, we validated our predictive model on four independent publicly available datasets (gse39582, gse17536, gse37892, and gse17537) from the geo database, consisting of 925 colon cancer",transcription factor expression predictor colon prognosis machine learn practice colon one leading cause death usa around world molecular level character gene expression level mutation may provide profound information precision apart pathological indicator transcription factor function critical regulator aspect cell life transcription factor base biomarkers colon prognosis still rare necessary implement innovative process select transcription factor variable evaluate prognostic prediction power combine cox ph model random forest algorithm pick five top rank transcription factor build prediction model use cox ph regression use kaplan meier validate predictive model four independent publicly available datasets gse gse gse gse geo database consist colon,a,Colon Cancer
"Family history of cancer and risk of colorectal cancer in Italy Subjects with a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) are at increased risk of CRC, but quantification of the risk in different populations, the possible differences in risk according to localization of the cancer and the association of family history of other cancers with CRC risk are still open issues. We have therefore analysed data from a multicentric case-control study conducted in six Italian areas between 1992 and 1996 of 1225 incident cases of colon cancer, 728 cases of rectal cancer and 4154 controls admitted for acute conditions to the same network of hospitals as the cases. Unconditional logistic regression models including terms for gender, age, study centre, years of education and number of siblings were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of CRC according to various aspects of history of CRC and other cancers in first-degree relatives. The OR for family history of CRC was 3.2 (95% confidence interval, CI, 2.5-4.1) for colon cancer and 2.2 (95% CI 1.6-3.1) for rectal cancer. Colon cancer was significantly associated with a family history of stomach (OR 1.4), bone (OR 2.1) and kidney (OR 2.3) cancers, while rectal cancer was significantly associated with a family history of lymphomas (OR 2.8). There was a 30% higher risk of colon and rectal cancer in subjects with a family history of any cancer, excluding intestine. The ORs for family history of CRC were 5.2 for colon and 6.3 for rectum when the proband's age was below 45 years. The ORs were similar when the affected relative was a parent or a sibling and in different strata of age of relative(s). For subjects with two or more first-degree relatives with CRC, the risk was 6.9 for the right colon, 5.8 for the transverse and descending colon, 3.8 for the sigma, 3.2 for the rectosigmoid junction and 1.9 for the rectum. This study confirms that a family history of CRC in first-degree relatives increases the risk of both colon and rectal cancer, the association being stronger at younger ages and for right colon.","family history of cancer and risk of colorectal cancer in italy subjects with a family history of colorectal cancer (crc) are at increased risk of crc, but quantification of the risk in different populations, the possible differences in risk according to localization of the cancer and the association of family history of other cancers with crc risk are still open issues. we have therefore analysed data from a multicentric case-control study conducted in six italian areas between 1992 and 1996 of 1225 incident cases of colon cancer, 728 cases of rectal cancer and 4154 controls admitted for acute conditions to the same network of hospitals as the cases. unconditional logistic regression models including terms for gender, age, study centre, years of education and number of siblings were used to estimate the odds ratios (ors) of crc according to various aspects of history of crc and other cancers in first-degree relatives.",family history risk colorectal italy subject family history colorectal crc increased risk crc quantification risk different population possible difference risk accord localization association family history crc risk still open issue therefore analyse data multicentric control conduct six italian area incident colon rectal control admit acute condition network hospital unconditional logistic regression model include term gender age centre year education number sibling use estimate odds ratios crc accord various aspect history crc first degree relative,a,Colon Cancer
"A steep increase in healthcare seeking behaviour in the last months before colorectal cancer diagnosis BACKGROUND Timely recognition of colorectal cancer related symptoms is essential to reduce time to diagnosis. This study aims to investigate the primary healthcare use preceding a colorectal cancer diagnosis. METHODS From a cohort of linked cancer and primary care data, patients diagnosed with primary colorectal cancer in the period 2007-2014 were selected and matched to cancer-free controls on gender, birth year, GP practice and follow-up period. Primary healthcare use among colorectal cancer cases before diagnosis was compared with matched cancer-free controls. Mean monthly number of GP consultations and newly prescribed medication was assessed in the year before index date (diagnosis date for cases). Results were stratified by colorectal cancer site: proximal colon cancer, distal colon cancer and rectal cancer. RESULTS A total of 6,087 colorectal cancer cases could be matched to four cancer-free controls (N = 24,348). While mean monthly number of GP consultation were stable through the year among cancer-free controls, a statistical significant increase was seen among colorectal cancer cases in the last 4-8 months before diagnosis. Proximal colon cancer cases showed the longest time interval of increased mean monthly number of GP consultations. This increase was largely driven by a consultation for malignant neoplasm colon/rectum. The number patients receiving a newly prescribed medication was stable around 120 per 1,000 persons per month until 8 months before index date for proximal colon cancer cases, 4 months before index date for distal colon cancer cases and 3 months for rectal cancer cases. This increase was mainly driven by the prescription of laxatives drugs. CONCLUSION An increase in the healthcare seeking behaviour of colorectal cancer patients prior to diagnosis was seen. The longest period of increased GP consultations and newly prescribed medication was seen among patients diagnosed with proximal colon cancer. This can be explained by the difficultly to diagnose proximal colon cancer given the more subtle signs compared to distal colon cancer and rectal cancer. Therefore, faster diagnosis for this specific tumour subtype may only be possible when clear clinical signs and symptoms are present.","a steep increase in healthcare seeking behaviour in the last months before colorectal cancer diagnosis background timely recognition of colorectal cancer related symptoms is essential to reduce time to diagnosis. this study aims to investigate the primary healthcare use preceding a colorectal cancer diagnosis. methods from a cohort of linked cancer and primary care data, patients diagnosed with primary colorectal cancer in the period 2007-2014 were selected and matched to cancer-free controls on gender, birth year, gp practice and follow-up period. primary healthcare use among colorectal cancer cases before diagnosis was compared with matched cancer-free controls. mean monthly number of gp consultations and newly prescribed medication was assessed in the year before index date (diagnosis date for cases). results were stratified by colorectal cancer site: proximal colon cancer, distal colon cancer and rectal cancer. results a total of 6,087 colorectal cancer cases could be matched to four cancer-free controls (n",steep increase healthcare seek behaviour last month colorectal diagnosis timely recognition colorectal relate symptom essential reduce time diagnosis investigate primary healthcare use precede colorectal diagnosis method cohort link primary care data diagnose primary colorectal period select match free control gender birth year gp practice follow period primary healthcare use among colorectal diagnosis compare matched free control mean monthly number gp consultation newly prescribe medication assess year index date diagnosis date result stratify colorectal site proximal colon distal colon rectal result total colorectal could match four free control n,a,Colon Cancer
"Elastin is a key factor of tumor development in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins regulate tumor growth and development in CRC. Elastin (ELN) is a component of ECM proteins involved in the tumor microenvironment. However, the role of ELN in CRC remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed ELN gene expression in tumors from CRC patients and adjacent non-tumor colon tissues and healthy controls from two existing microarray datasets. ELN protein was measured in human normal colon cells and colon cancer epithelial cells and tumor development was assessed in colon epithelial cells cultured in medium with or without ELN peptide on plates coated with ELN recombinant protein. Control plates were coated with PBS only. We found ELN gene expression was increased in tumors from CRC patients compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and healthy controls. ELN protein was increased in cancer cells compared to normal colon epithelial cells. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) was a key cytokine to induce production of ECM proteins, but it did not induce ELN expression in colon cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene expression was increased, but that of MMP12 (elastase) did not change between CRC patients and control. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) gene expression was decreased in colon tissues from CRC patients compared to healthy controls. However, MMP9, MMP12 and TIMP3 proteins were increased in colon cancer cells. ELN recombinant protein increased proliferation and wound healing in colon cancer epithelial cells. This had further increased in cancer cells incubated in plates coated with recombinant ELN coated plate and in culture media containing ELN peptide. A potential mechanism was that ELN induced epithelial mesenchymal transition with increased alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin proteins but decreased E-cadherin protein. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) mRNA was also increased in CRC patients compared to controls. ELN recombinant protein induced further increases in TNF protein in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These data suggest ELN regulates tumor development and the microenvironment in CRC.","elastin is a key factor of tumor development in colorectal cancer colorectal cancer (crc) is the most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins regulate tumor growth and development in crc. elastin (eln) is a component of ecm proteins involved in the tumor microenvironment. however, the role of eln in crc remains unclear. in this study, we analyzed eln gene expression in tumors from crc patients and adjacent non-tumor colon tissues and healthy controls from two existing microarray datasets. eln protein was measured in human normal colon cells and colon cancer epithelial cells and tumor development was assessed in colon epithelial cells cultured in medium with or without eln peptide on plates coated with eln recombinant protein. control plates were coated with pbs only. we found eln gene expression was increased in tumors from crc patients compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and healthy controls.",elastin key factor development colorectal colorectal crc common leading cause death worldwide extracellular matrix ecm protein regulate growth development crc elastin eln component ecm protein involve microenvironment however role eln crc remains unclear analyze eln gene expression crc adjacent non colon tissue healthy control two exist microarray datasets eln protein measure human normal colon cell colon epithelial cell development assess colon epithelial cell culture medium without eln peptide plate coat eln recombinant protein control plate coat pbs find eln gene expression increase crc compare adjacent non tissue healthy control,a,Colon Cancer

"Body mass index and colon cancer: an evaluation of the modifying effects of estrogen (United States) Objective: The association between body mass index (BMI) and colon cancer has been reported to be different for men and women. No prior literature has examined if estrogen influences these differences. Methods: Using data from an incident population-based case (n = 1972) and control (n = 2386) study of colon cancer we evaluated if estrogen modifies the association between BMI and risk of colon cancer. Results: Women who were estrogen-negative (postmenopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy, HRT) were at increased risk of colon cancer regardless of indicator of estrogen status used (i.e. estrogen-negative compared to estrogen-positive women defined as either being premenopausal or postmenopausal women using HRT, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.23–1.93; no recent exposure to estrogens compared to current or HRT use within the past 2 years, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.24–2.00; postmenopausal women not currently using HRT compared to postmenopausal women taking HRT, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29–2.12). BMI (kg/m2) was not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer among women who were estrogen-negative. However, women who were estrogen-positive experienced a greater than two-fold increase in colon cancer risk if they had a BMI of > 30 relative to those who had a BMI of <23 (for estrogen-positive, OR, 2.50, 95% CI 1.51–4.13; premenopausal, OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.94–5.07; postmenopausal using HRT, OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.58–7.13). Among men the colon cancer risk associated with BMI decreased with advancing age. Physical activity modified the increased colon cancer risk associated with a large BMI. Conclusions: These data suggest the importance of estrogen in colon cancer etiology. Being estrogen-negative resulted in a significant increased risk of colon cancer. However, BMI significantly increased the risk of colon cancer among women who were estrogen-positive. We hypothesize that estrogen up-regulates IGF-I receptors and IRS-I levels in the colon, which in turn increases susceptibility to obesity-induced increased levels of insulin. We further hypothesize that androgens may have similar effects in men given the decline in colon cancer risk associated with BMI with advancing age.","body mass index and colon cancer: an evaluation of the modifying effects of estrogen (united states) objective: the association between body mass index (bmi) and colon cancer has been reported to be different for men and women. no prior literature has examined if estrogen influences these differences. methods: using data from an incident population-based case (n = 1972) and control (n = 2386) study of colon cancer we evaluated if estrogen modifies the association between bmi and risk of colon cancer. results: women who were estrogen-negative (postmenopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy, hrt) were at increased risk of colon cancer regardless of indicator of estrogen status used (i.e. estrogen-negative compared to estrogen-positive women defined as either being premenopausal or postmenopausal women using hrt, or 1.54, 95% ci 1.23–1.93; no recent exposure to estrogens compared to current or hrt use within the past 2 years, or 1.58, 95% ci 1.24–2.00;",body mass index colon evaluation modifying effect estrogen united state association body mass index bmi colon report different men woman prior literature examine estrogen influence difference method use data incident population base n control n colon evaluate estrogen modify association bmi risk colon result woman estrogen negative postmenopausal woman take hormone replacement therapy hrt increase risk colon regardless indicator estrogen status use e estrogen negative compare estrogen positive woman define either premenopausal postmenopausal woman use hrt ci recent exposure estrogen compare current hrt use within past year ci,a,Colon Cancer
"Ceramide targets xIAP and cIAP1 to sensitize metastatic colon and breast cancer cells to apoptosis induction to suppress tumor progression Ceramide is a bioeffector that mediates various cellular processes, including apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying ceramide function in apoptosis is apparently cell type-dependent and is not well-understood. We aimed at identifying molecular targets of ceramide in metastatic human colon and breast cancer cells, and determining the efficacy of ceramide analog in suppression of colon and breast cancer metastasis. The activity of and mechanism underlying ceramide as a cytotoxic agent, and as a sensitizer for Fas-mediated apoptosis was analyzed in human cell lines established from primary or metastatic colon and breast cancers. The efficacy of ceramide analog LCL85 in suppression of metastasis was examined in preclinical mouse tumor models. Exposure of human colon carcinoma cells to ceramide analog LCL85 results in apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, a sublethal dose of LCL85 increased C16 ceramide content and overcame tumor cell resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Subsequently, treatment of tumor cells with exogenous C16 ceramide resulted in increased tumor cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. LCL85 resembles Smac mimetic BV6 in sensitization of colon carcinoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis by inducing proteasomal degradation of cIAP1 and xIAP proteins. LCL85 also decreased xIAP1 and cIAP1 protein levels and sensitized metastatic human breast cancer cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Silencing xIAP and cIAP1 with specific siRNAs significantly increased the metastatic human colon carcinoma cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that IAP proteins mediate apoptosis resistance in metastatic human colon carcinoma cells and ceramide induces IAP protein degradation to sensitize the tumor cells to apoptosis induction. Consistent with its apoptosis sensitization activity, subtoxic doses of LCL85 suppressed colon carcinoma cell metastatic potential in an experimental lung metastasis mouse model, as well as breast cancer growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model. We have identified xIAP and cIAP1 as molecular targets of ceramide and determined that ceramide analog LCL85 is an effective sensitizer in overcoming resistance of human cell lines established from metastatic colon and breast cancers to apoptosis induction to suppress metastasis in vivo.","ceramide targets xiap and ciap1 to sensitize metastatic colon and breast cancer cells to apoptosis induction to suppress tumor progression ceramide is a bioeffector that mediates various cellular processes, including apoptosis. however, the mechanism underlying ceramide function in apoptosis is apparently cell type-dependent and is not well-understood. we aimed at identifying molecular targets of ceramide in metastatic human colon and breast cancer cells, and determining the efficacy of ceramide analog in suppression of colon and breast cancer metastasis. the activity of and mechanism underlying ceramide as a cytotoxic agent, and as a sensitizer for fas-mediated apoptosis was analyzed in human cell lines established from primary or metastatic colon and breast cancers. the efficacy of ceramide analog lcl85 in suppression of metastasis was examined in preclinical mouse tumor models. exposure of human colon carcinoma cells to ceramide analog lcl85 results in apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. interestingly, a sublethal dose of",ceramide target xiap ciap sensitize metastatic colon breast cell apoptosis induction suppress progression ceramide bioeffector mediate various cellular process include apoptosis however mechanism underlie ceramide function apoptosis apparently cell type dependent well understood identify molecular target ceramide metastatic human colon breast cell determine efficacy ceramide analog suppression colon breast metastasis activity mechanism underlie ceramide cytotoxic agent sensitizer fa mediate apoptosis analyze human cell line establish primary metastatic colon breast efficacy ceramide analog lcl suppression metastasis examine preclinical mouse model exposure human colon carcinoma cell ceramide analog lcl result apoptosis dose dependent manner interestingly sublethal dose,a,Colon Cancer
"Left colon as a novel high-risk factor for postoperative recurrence of stage II colon cancer It is not clear whether stage II colon and rectal cancer have the same risk factors for recurrence. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for postoperative recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 990 patients who had undergone radical surgery for stage II colorectal cancer. Patients’ pathological features and characteristics including age, sex, family history, body mass index, tumor diameter, gross type of tumor, infiltration degree (T3/T4), tumor grade, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, pathologic examination of lymph node number, and preoperative carcinoembryonic assay (CEA) level was compared between patients with and without recurrence. Finally, the prediction of the left and right colons was analyzed. The mean ages of the colon cancer and rectal cancer patients were 69.5 years and 66.4 years, respectively. In total, 508 (82.1%) and 285 (76.8%) patients were treated laparoscopically for colon cancer and rectal cancer, respectively, with median follow-up periods of 42.2 months and 41.8 months, respectively. Forty-four recurrences occurred in both the colon cancer (7.1%) and rectal cancer (11.9%) groups. The preoperative serum CEA level and T4 infiltration were significantly higher in recurrent colorectal cancer patients. The postoperative recurrence rate of left colon cancer (descending colon, sigmoid colon) was higher than that of right colon cancer (cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon) (OR 2.191, 95% CI 1.091–4.400, P = 0.027). In COX survival factor analysis of colon cancer, the left colon is one of the independent risk factors (risk ratio 5.377, 95% CI 0.216–0.88, P = 0.02). In disease-free survival (DFS), the left colon has a relatively poor prognosis (P = 0.05). However, in the COX analysis and prognosis analysis of OS, no difference was found between the left colon and the right colon. Preoperative CEA and depth of infiltration (T4) are high-risk factors associated with recurrence and are prognostic factors in stage II colorectal cancer. Left colon is also a risk factor for postoperative recurrence of stage II colon cancer.","left colon as a novel high-risk factor for postoperative recurrence of stage ii colon cancer it is not clear whether stage ii colon and rectal cancer have the same risk factors for recurrence. thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for postoperative recurrence in stage ii colorectal cancer. we retrospectively analyzed the data of 990 patients who had undergone radical surgery for stage ii colorectal cancer. patients’ pathological features and characteristics including age, sex, family history, body mass index, tumor diameter, gross type of tumor, infiltration degree (t3/t4), tumor grade, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, pathologic examination of lymph node number, and preoperative carcinoembryonic assay (cea) level was compared between patients with and without recurrence. finally, the prediction of the left and right colons was analyzed. the mean ages of the colon cancer and rectal cancer patients were 69.5 years and 66.4 years, respectively.",left colon novel high risk factor postoperative recurrence stage ii colon clear whether stage ii colon rectal risk factor recurrence thus identify risk factor postoperative recurrence stage ii colorectal retrospectively analyze data undergone radical surgery stage ii colorectal pathological feature characteristic include age sex family history body mass index diameter gross type infiltration degree grade perineural invasion vascular invasion lymphatic invasion pathologic examination lymph node number preoperative carcinoembryonic assay cea level compare without recurrence finally prediction left right colon analyze mean age colon rectal year year respectively,a,Colon Cancer
"miR-378 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by inhibiting SDAD1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the growth and metastasis of colon cancer. It is known that one set of miRNAs are dysregulated in colon cancer cells, but the mechanism of their role in cancer development is still largely unknown. Our study focuses on the role of miR-378 in colon cancer cells. Human colon cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected from patients diagnosed in pathological examinations. In addition, human colon cancer cell lines LoVo, CaCo2, SW1116, SW480 and HCT-116, and a normal colonic mucosa cell line NCM460 were included. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the miR-378 level in the clinical tissues and cell lines. In SW480 and HCT-116, miR-378 was artificially overexpressed or suppressed. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using MTT and colony formation assays, and apoptosis was detected via annexin V-PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. The transwell technique was applied to detect the migration and invasion of the colon cancer cells, and their epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated by detecting EMT-associated markers using Western blotting. Bioinformatics methods were used to predict the potential targets of miR-378, and luciferase reporter assays were performed to conform the direct binding between miR-378 and its target mRNA. The activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was evaluated by detecting the key factors through Western blotting. We found that miR-378 expression was low in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-378 not only inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis, but also inhibits migration and invasion by inhibiting the EMT of colon cancer cells. SDAD1 is a direct target gene of miR-378, and knockdown of SDAD1 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. We also confirmed that miR-378 alleviated the malignant phenotypes of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. miR-378 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by targeting SDAD1, defining miR-378 as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer.","mir-378 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by inhibiting sdad1. micrornas (mirnas) play important roles in the growth and metastasis of colon cancer. it is known that one set of mirnas are dysregulated in colon cancer cells, but the mechanism of their role in cancer development is still largely unknown. our study focuses on the role of mir-378 in colon cancer cells. human colon cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected from patients diagnosed in pathological examinations. in addition, human colon cancer cell lines lovo, caco2, sw1116, sw480 and hct-116, and a normal colonic mucosa cell line ncm460 were included. quantitative rt-pcr was used to detect the mir-378 level in the clinical tissues and cell lines. in sw480 and hct-116, mir-378 was artificially overexpressed or suppressed. cell viability and proliferation were measured using mtt and colony formation assays, and apoptosis was detected via annexin v-pi",mir suppress proliferation migration invasion colon cell inhibit sdad micrornas mirnas play important role growth metastasis colon know one set mirnas dysregulated colon cell mechanism role development still largely unknown focus role mir colon cell human colon tissue adjacent non tissue collect diagnose pathological examination addition human colon cell line lovo caco sw sw hct normal colonic mucosa cell line ncm include quantitative rt pcr use detect mir level tissue cell line sw hct mir artificially overexpressed suppress cell viability proliferation measure use mtt colony formation assay apoptosis detect via annexin v pi,a,Colon Cancer
"Are transverse colon cancers suitable for laparoscopic resection The large randomized trials reporting on laparoscopic versus open colon surgery for cancer have all excluded patients with transverse colon cancer lesions. This study was undertaken to review our experience with surgery for curable transverse colon cancer. A database of 938 laparoscopic colon resections performed between April 1991 and September 2004 was reviewed. Of 514 procedures for cancer, stage IV disease, mid to low rectal cancers, and total colectomies were excluded. On an intent-to-treat basis, outcomes of surgery for transverse colon lesions (TC) were compared with outcomes of segmental colon resections for other lesions (OC). A total of 22 TC were resected compared with 285 OC. Patients with TC were similar to patients with OC in age, gender, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Cancer stage was equivalent between patients with TC (9 Stage I, 7 Stage II, 6 Stage III) and OC (66 Stage I, 126 Stage II, 93 Stage III, p = 0.170) as was tumor size. Patients with TC underwent 9 transverse colectomies, 12 extended right hemicolectomies, and 1 extended left hemicolectomy. Patients with OC underwent 126 right hemicolectomies, 24 left hemicolectomies, and 135 sigmoid colectomies or anterior resections. There were no differences in conversion rate (18.2% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.752) or in intraoperative (9% vs. 8%, p = 0.814) or postoperative (41% vs. 30%, p = 0.418) complications. Operating time was longer with TC (209 ± 63 min vs. 176 ± 60 min, p = 0.042) and lymph node harvest was higher (15.3 ± 11.6 vs. 10.8 ± 7.6, p = 0.011). At a median followup of 17.2 months and 17.1 months, respectively, there were two (9%) recurrences after resection of TC and 17 (6%) recurrences after resection of OC.

There are two structurally and functionally distinct classes of mucins: secreted gel-forming mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6) and transmembrane mucins (MUC1, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC17), although the products of some MUC genes do not fit well into either class (MUC7, MUC8, MUC9, MUC13, MUC15, MUC16). MUC1 mucin, as detected immunologically, is increased in expression in colon cancers, which correlates with a worse prognosis. Expression of MUC2 secreted gel-forming mucin is generally decreased in colorectal adenocarcinoma, but preserved in mucinous carcinomas, a distinct subtype of colon cancer associated with microsatellite instability. Another secreted gel-forming mucin, MUC5AC, a product of normal gastric mucosa, is absent from normal colon, but frequently present in colorectal adenomas and colon cancers. The O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides of mucins can be described in terms of core type, backbone type, and peripheral structures. Colon cancer mucins have differences in both core carbohydrates and in peripheral carbohydrate structures that are being investigated as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and also as targets for cancer vaccines. Colon cancer mucins typically have increases in three core structures: Tn antigen (GalNAcalphaThr/Ser), TF antigen (Galbeta3GalNAc) and sialyl Tn (NeuAcalpha6GalNAc). The type 3 core (GlcNAcbeta3Ga1NAc) predominant in normal colonic mucin is lacking in colon cancer mucins. There are cancer-associated alterations in the peripheral carbohydrates of colonic mucins including a decrease in O-acetyl-sialic acid and a decrease in sulfation. There are, however, cancer-associated increases in sialyl LeX and related structures on mucins and other glycoproteins that can serve as ligands for selectins, increasing the metastatic capacity of colon cancer cells. The endogenous galactoside-binding protein galectin-3, which is expressed at higher levels in colon cancers than normal colon, binds to colon cancer mucin as well as other glycoproteins. Interference of the binding of selectins and galectin-3 to mucin may show therapeutic or preventative promise for colon cancer.","mucins and mucin binding proteins in colorectal cancer. mucins are high-molecular weight epithelial glycoproteins with a high content of clustered oligosaccharides o-glycosidically linked to tandem repeat peptides rich in threonine, serine, and proline. there are two structurally and functionally distinct classes of mucins: secreted gel-forming mucins (muc2, muc5ac, muc5b, and muc6) and transmembrane mucins (muc1, muc3a, muc3b, muc4, muc12, muc17), although the products of some muc genes do not fit well into either class (muc7, muc8, muc9, muc13, muc15, muc16). muc1 mucin, as detected immunologically, is increased in expression in colon cancers, which correlates with a worse prognosis. expression of muc2 secreted gel-forming mucin is generally decreased in colorectal adenocarcinoma, but preserved in mucinous carcinomas, a distinct subtype of colon cancer associated with microsatellite instability. another secreted gel-forming mucin, muc5ac, a product of normal gastric mucosa, is absent from normal colon, but frequently present in colorectal adenomas and colon cancers.",mucin mucin binding protein colorectal mucin high molecular weight epithelial glycoprotein high content clustered oligosaccharide glycosidically link tandem repeat peptide rich threonine serine proline two structurally functionally distinct class mucin secrete gel forming mucin muc muc ac muc b muc transmembrane mucin muc muc muc b muc muc muc although product muc gene fit well either class muc muc muc muc muc muc muc mucin detect immunologically increase expression colon correlate bad prognosis expression muc secrete gel forming mucin generally decrease colorectal adenocarcinoma preserve mucinous carcinoma distinct subtype colon associate microsatellite instability another secrete gel form mucin muc ac product normal gastric mucosa absent normal colon frequently present colorectal adenoma colon,a,Colon Cancer
"Biomarker correlation network in colorectal carcinoma by tumor anatomic location. Colorectal carcinoma evolves through a multitude of molecular events including somatic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and aberrant protein expression, influenced by host immune reactions. One way to interrogate the complex carcinogenic process and interactions between aberrant events is to model a biomarker correlation network. Such a network analysis integrates multidimensional tumor biomarker data to identify key molecular events and pathways that are central to an underlying biological process. Due to embryological, physiological, and microbial differences, proximal and distal colorectal cancers have distinct sets of molecular pathological signatures. Given these differences, we hypothesized that a biomarker correlation network might vary by tumor location. We performed network analyses of 54 biomarkers, including major mutational events, microsatellite instability (MSI), epigenetic features, protein expression status, and immune reactions using data from 1380 colorectal cancer cases: 690 cases with proximal colon cancer and 690 cases with distal colorectal cancer matched by age and sex. Edges were defined by statistically significant correlations between biomarkers using Spearman correlation analyses. We found that the proximal colon cancer network formed a denser network (total number of edges, n = 173) than the distal colorectal cancer network (n = 95) (P < 0.0001 in permutation tests). The value of the average clustering coefficient was 0.50 in the proximal colon cancer network and 0.30 in the distal colorectal cancer network, indicating the greater clustering tendency of the proximal colon cancer network. In particular, MSI was a key hub, highly connected with other biomarkers in proximal colon cancer, but not in distal colorectal cancer. Among patients with non-MSI-high cancer, BRAF mutation status emerged as a distinct marker with higher connectivity in the network of proximal colon cancer, but not in distal colorectal cancer. In proximal colon cancer, tumor biomarkers tended to be correlated with each other, and MSI and BRAF mutation functioned as key molecular characteristics during the carcinogenesis. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple correlated pathways for therapeutic targets especially in proximal colon cancer.","biomarker correlation network in colorectal carcinoma by tumor anatomic location. colorectal carcinoma evolves through a multitude of molecular events including somatic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and aberrant protein expression, influenced by host immune reactions. one way to interrogate the complex carcinogenic process and interactions between aberrant events is to model a biomarker correlation network. such a network analysis integrates multidimensional tumor biomarker data to identify key molecular events and pathways that are central to an underlying biological process. due to embryological, physiological, and microbial differences, proximal and distal colorectal cancers have distinct sets of molecular pathological signatures. given these differences, we hypothesized that a biomarker correlation network might vary by tumor location. we performed network analyses of 54 biomarkers, including major mutational events, microsatellite instability (msi), epigenetic features, protein expression status, and immune reactions using data from 1380 colorectal cancer cases: 690 cases with proximal colon cancer and 690 cases with",biomarker correlation network colorectal carcinoma anatomic location colorectal carcinoma evolve multitude molecular event include somatic mutation epigenetic alteration aberrant protein expression influence host immune reaction one way interrogate complex carcinogenic process interaction aberrant event model biomarker correlation network network integrate multidimensional biomarker data identify key molecular event pathway central underlying biological process due embryological physiological microbial difference proximal distal colorectal distinct set molecular pathological signature give difference hypothesize biomarker correlation network might vary location perform network biomarkers include major mutational event microsatellite instability msi epigenetic feature protein expression status immune reaction use data colorectal proximal colon,a,Colon Cancer
"Right and left-sided colon cancers - specificity of molecular mechanisms in tumorigenesis and progression Given the differences in embryonic origin, vascular and nervous supplies, microbiotic burden, and main physiological functions of left and right colons, tumor location is increasingly suggested to dictate tumor behavior affecting pathology, progression and prognosis. Right-sided colon cancers arise in the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure and/or transverse colon, while left-sided colon cancers arise in the splenic flexure, descending, and/or sigmoid colon. In contrast to prior reports, we attempt to delineate programs of tumorigenesis independently for each side. Four hundred and eleven samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas-COAD cohort, based on a conservative sample inclusion criterion. Each side was independently analyzed with respect to their respective normal tissue, at the level of transcription, post-transcription, miRNA control and methylation in both a stage specific and stage-agnostic manner. Our results indicate a suppression of enzymes involved in various stages of carcinogen breakdown including CYP2C8, CYP4F12, GSTA1, and UGT1A within right colon tumors. This implies its reduced capacity to detoxify carcinogens, contributing to a genotoxic tumor environment, and subsequently a more aggressive phenotype. Additionally, we highlight a crucial nexus between calcium homeostasis (sensing, mobilization and absorption) and immune/GPCR signaling within left-sided tumors, possibly contributing to its reduced proliferative and metastatic potential. Interestingly, two genes SLC6A4 and HOXB13 show opposing regulatory trends within right and left tumors. Post-transcriptional regulation mediated by both RNA-binding proteins (e.g. NKRF (in left) and MSI2 (in right)) and miRNAs (e.g. miR-29a (in left); miR-155, miR181-d, miR-576 and miR23a (in right)) appear to exhibit side-specificity in control of their target transcripts and is pronounced in right colon tumors. Additionally, methylation results depict location-specific differences, with increased hypomethylation in open seas within left tumors, and increased hypermethylation of CpG islands within right tumors. Differences in molecular mechanisms captured here highlight distinctions in tumorigenesis and progression between left and right colon tumors, which will serve as the basis for future studies, influencing the efficacies of existing and future diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic interventions.","right and left-sided colon cancers - specificity of molecular mechanisms in tumorigenesis and progression given the differences in embryonic origin, vascular and nervous supplies, microbiotic burden, and main physiological functions of left and right colons, tumor location is increasingly suggested to dictate tumor behavior affecting pathology, progression and prognosis. right-sided colon cancers arise in the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure and/or transverse colon, while left-sided colon cancers arise in the splenic flexure, descending, and/or sigmoid colon. in contrast to prior reports, we attempt to delineate programs of tumorigenesis independently for each side. four hundred and eleven samples were extracted from the cancer genome atlas-coad cohort, based on a conservative sample inclusion criterion. each side was independently analyzed with respect to their respective normal tissue, at the level of transcription, post-transcription, mirna control and methylation in both a stage specific and stage-agnostic manner. our results indicate a suppression of enzymes involved",right leave side colon specificity molecular mechanism tumorigenesis progression give difference embryonic origin vascular nervous supply microbiotic burden main physiological function left right colon location increasingly suggest dictate behavior affect pathology progression prognosis right side colon arise cecum ascend colon hepatic flexure transverse colon leave side colon arise splenic flexure descending sigmoid colon contrast prior report attempt delineate program tumorigenesis independently side four hundred eleven sample extract genome atlas coad cohort base conservative sample inclusion criterion side independently analyze respect respective normal tissue level transcription post transcription mirna control methylation stage specific stage agnostic manner result indicate suppression enzyme involve,a,Colon Cancer
"Physical activity and risk of colorectal cancer in men and women We examined the association between self-reported occupational and recreational physical activity and the subsequent risk of colorectal cancer in a population-based cohort in Norway. During a mean follow-up time of 16.3 years for males and 15.5 years for females, 236 and 99 colon cancers and 170 and 58 rectal cancers were observed in males and females, respectively, among 53,242 males and 28,274 females who attended the screening between 1972 and 1978. Physical activity at a level equivalent to walking or bicycling for at least four hours a week during leisure-time was associated with decreased risk of colon cancer among females when compared with the sedentary group (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97). Reduced risk of colon cancer was particularly marked in the proximal colon (RR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93). This effect was not observed for occupational physical activity alone, probably due to a narrow range of self-reported physical activity at work among females. However, by combining occupational and recreational physical activity we observed an inverse dose-response effect as increasing total activity significantly reduced colon cancer risk (P for trend = 0.04). Among males 45 years or older at entry to the study, an inverse dose-response effect was observed between total physical activity and colon cancer risk (P for trend = 0.04). We also found in males a stronger preventive effect for physical activity in the proximal as compared to distal colon. In addition, we found a borderline significant decrease in colon cancer risk for occupational physical activity in males 45 years or older when compared to the sedentary group (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.53-1.04). All results were adjusted for age, body mass index, serum cholesterol and geographic region. No association between physical activity and rectal cancer was observed in males or females. The protective effect of physical activity on colon cancer risk is discussed in regard to energy balance, dietary factors, age, social class, body mass index and gastrointestinal transit time.","physical activity and risk of colorectal cancer in men and women we examined the association between self-reported occupational and recreational physical activity and the subsequent risk of colorectal cancer in a population-based cohort in norway. during a mean follow-up time of 16.3 years for males and 15.5 years for females, 236 and 99 colon cancers and 170 and 58 rectal cancers were observed in males and females, respectively, among 53,242 males and 28,274 females who attended the screening between 1972 and 1978. physical activity at a level equivalent to walking or bicycling for at least four hours a week during leisure-time was associated with decreased risk of colon cancer among females when compared with the sedentary group (rr = 0.62, 95% ci 0.40-0.97). reduced risk of colon cancer was particularly marked in the proximal colon (rr = 0.51, 95% ci 0.28-0.93). this effect was not observed for occupational physical activity",physical activity risk colorectal men woman examine association self report occupational recreational physical activity subsequent risk colorectal population base cohort norway mean follow time year male year female colon rectal observe male female respectively among male female attend screening physical activity level equivalent walk bicycle least four hour week leisure time associate decreased risk colon among female compare sedentary group rr ci reduce risk colon particularly mark proximal colon rr ci effect observe occupational physical activity,a,Colon Cancer
"NK-cell-dependent killing of colon carcinoma cells is mediated by natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and stimulated by parvovirus infection of target cells Investigating how the immune system functions during malignancies is crucial to developing novel therapeutic strategies. Natural killer (NK) cells, an important component of the innate immune system, play a vital role in immune defense against tumors and virus-infected cells. The poor survival rate in colon cancer makes it particularly important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Oncolytic viruses, in addition to lysing tumor cells, may have the potential to augment antitumor immune responses. In the present study, we investigate the role of NK cells and how parvovirus H-1PV can modulate NK-cell mediated immune responses against colon carcinoma. Human NK cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors. The cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated inhibition of NK cells were measured in chromium release assays. Phenotypic assessment of colon cancer and dendritic cells was done by FACS. The statistical significance of the results was calculated with Student’s t test (*p <0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). We show that IL-2-activated human NK cells can effectively kill colon carcinoma cells. Killing of colon carcinoma cells by NK cells was further enhanced upon infection of the former cells with parvovirus H-1PV. H-1PV has potent oncolytic activity against various tumors, yet its direct killing effect on colon carcinoma cells is limited. The cytotoxicity of NK cells towards colon carcinoma cells, both mock- and H-1PV-infected, was found to be mostly mediated by a combination of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), namely NKp30, 44, and 46. Colon carcinoma cells displayed low to moderate expression of NK cell ligands, and this expression was modulated upon H-1PV infection. Lysates of H-1PV-infected colon carcinoma cells were found to increase MHC class II expression on dendritic cells. Altogether, these data suggest that IL-2-activated NK cells actively kill colon carcinoma cells and that this killing is mediated by several natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) in combination. Additionally, in association with parvovirus H-1PV, IL-2-activated NK cells have the potential to boost immune responses against colon cancer.","nk-cell-dependent killing of colon carcinoma cells is mediated by natural cytotoxicity receptors (ncrs) and stimulated by parvovirus infection of target cells investigating how the immune system functions during malignancies is crucial to developing novel therapeutic strategies. natural killer (nk) cells, an important component of the innate immune system, play a vital role in immune defense against tumors and virus-infected cells. the poor survival rate in colon cancer makes it particularly important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. oncolytic viruses, in addition to lysing tumor cells, may have the potential to augment antitumor immune responses. in the present study, we investigate the role of nk cells and how parvovirus h-1pv can modulate nk-cell mediated immune responses against colon carcinoma. human nk cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors. the cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated inhibition of nk cells were measured in chromium release assays. phenotypic assessment of colon cancer and dendritic cells",nk cell dependent killing colon carcinoma cell mediate natural cytotoxicity receptor ncrs stimulate parvovirus infection target cell investigate immune system function malignancy crucial develop novel therapeutic strategy natural killer nk cell important component innate immune system play vital role immune defense virus infected cell poor survival rate colon make particularly important develop novel therapeutic strategy oncolytic virus addition lysing cell may potential augment antitumor immune response present investigate role nk cell parvovirus h pv modulate nk cell mediate immune response colon carcinoma human nk cell isolate blood healthy donor cytotoxicity antibody mediated inhibition nk cell measure chromium release assay phenotypic assessment colon dendritic cell,a,Colon Cancer
"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms in colon and lung cancer patients N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolizes arylamines and hydrazines moeities found in many therapeutic drugs, chemicals and carcinogens. The gene encoding NAT2 is polymorphic, thus resulting in rapid or slow acetylator phenotypes. The acetylator status may, therefore, predispose drug-induced toxicities and cancer risks, such as bladder, colon and lung cancer. Indeed, some studies demonstrate a positive association between NAT2 rapid acetylator phenotype and colon cancer, but results are inconsistent. The role of NAT2 acetylation status in lung cancer is likewise unclear, in which both the rapid and slow acetylator genotypes have been associated with disease. We investigated three genetic variations, c.481C>T, c.590G>A (p.R197Q) and c.857G>A (p.G286E), of the NAT2 gene, which are known to result in a slow acetylator phenotype. Using validated PCR-RFLP assays, we genotyped 243 healthy unrelated Caucasian control subjects, 92 colon and 67 lung cancer patients for these genetic variations. As there is a recent meta-analysis of NAT2 studies on colon cancer (unlike in lung cancer), we have also undertaken a systematic review of NAT2 studies on lung cancer, and we incorporated our results in a meta-analysis consisting of 16 studies, 3,865 lung cancer patients and 6,077 control subjects. We did not obtain statistically significant differences in NAT2 allele and genotype frequencies in colon cancer patients and control group. Certain genotypes, however, such as [c.590AA+c.857GA] and [c.590GA+c.857GA] were absent among the colon cancer patients. Similarly, allele frequencies in lung cancer patients and controls did not differ significantly. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase of genotypes [c.590GA] and [c.481CT+c.590GA], but absence of homozygous c.590AA and [c.590AA+c.857GA] in the lung cancer group. Meta-analysis of 16 NAT2 studies on lung cancer did not evidence an overall association of the rapid or slow acetylator status to lung cancer. Similarly, the summary odds ratios obtained with stratified meta-analysis based on ethnicity, and smoking status were not significant.

"Ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis and prevents polarization of M2 tumor-associated macrophages through YAP oncogenic pathways An increased expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP1) has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in many cancer types including colon. However, the role of YAP1 in promoting colon tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that YAP1 expression is associated with M2 tumor-associated macrophage polarization and the generation of colon cancer stem-like cells. YAP1 downregulation by gene silencing or a phytochemical, ovatodiolide, not only suppresses colon cancer tumorigenesis but also prevents M2 TAM polarization. Human monocytic cells, THP-1, and colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and DLD-1, were co-cultured to mimic the interactions between tumor and its microenvironment. M2 polarization of the THP-1 cells were examined using both flow cytometry and q-PCR technique. The inhibition of YAP1 signaling was achieved by gene-silencing technique or ovatodiolide. The molecular consequences of YAP1 inhibition was demonstrated via colony formation, migration, and colon-sphere formation assays. 5-FU and ovatodiolide were used in drug combination studies. Xenograft and syngeneic mouse models were used to investigate the role of YAP1 in colon tumorigenesis and TAM generation. An increased YAP1 expression was found to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer using bioinformatics approach. We showed an increased YAP1 expression in the colon spheres, and colon cancer cells co-cultured with M2 TAMs. YAP1-silencing led to the concomitant decreased expression of major oncogenic pathways including Kras, mTOR, β-catenin, and M2-promoting IL-4 and tumor-promoting IL-6 cytokines. TAM co-cultured colon spheres showed a significantly higher tumor-initiating ability in vivo. Ovatodiolide treatment alone and in combination with 5-FU significantly suppressed in vivo tumorigenesis and less TAM infiltration in CT26 syngeneic mouse model. We have identified the dual function of YAP1 where its suppression not only inhibited tumorigenesis but also prevented the generation of cancer stem-like cells and M2 TAM polarization. Ovatodiolide treatment suppressed YAP1 oncogenic pathways to inhibit colon tumorigenesis and M2 TAM generation both in vitro and in vivo. Ovatodiolide should be considered for its potential for adjuvant therapeutic development.","ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis and prevents polarization of m2 tumor-associated macrophages through yap oncogenic pathways an increased expression of yes-associated protein (yap1) has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in many cancer types including colon. however, the role of yap1 in promoting colon tumorigenesis remains unclear. here, we demonstrate that yap1 expression is associated with m2 tumor-associated macrophage polarization and the generation of colon cancer stem-like cells. yap1 downregulation by gene silencing or a phytochemical, ovatodiolide, not only suppresses colon cancer tumorigenesis but also prevents m2 tam polarization. human monocytic cells, thp-1, and colon cancer cell lines, hct116 and dld-1, were co-cultured to mimic the interactions between tumor and its microenvironment. m2 polarization of the thp-1 cells were examined using both flow cytometry and q-pcr technique. the inhibition of yap1 signaling was achieved by gene-silencing technique or ovatodiolide. the molecular consequences of yap1 inhibition was demonstrated via colony formation, migration, and",ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis prevents polarization associate macrophage yap oncogenic pathways increased expression yes associate protein yap show promote tumorigenesis many type include colon however role yap promote colon tumorigenesis remain unclear demonstrate yap expression associate associate macrophage polarization generation colon stem like cell yap downregulation gene silencing phytochemical ovatodiolide suppress colon tumorigenesis also prevent tam polarization human monocytic cell thp colon cell line hct dld co culture mimic interaction microenvironment polarization thp cell examine use flow cytometry q pcr technique inhibition yap signaling achieve gene silence technique ovatodiolide molecular consequence yap inhibition demonstrate via colony formation migration,a,Colon Cancer

"Partial purification of organ-specific neoantigens from human colon and breast cancer by affinity chromatography with human tumour-specific gamma-globulin. Organ-specific neoantigens (TA) shed from the tumours of patients with metastatic breast or colon cancer and which had filtered into the urine were partially purified by a combination of physicochemical methods and affinity chromatography. TA activity of the isolated materials was monitored by the blocking Tube LAI assay. Urinary protein was precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulphate.

"FABP4 promotes invasion and metastasis of colon cancer by regulating fatty acid transport The prognosis of colon cancer is poor for metastasis, while the mechanism, especially adipocytes related, is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a transporter for lipids, on colon cancer progression. The distribution of lipids and FABP4 was tested in the colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their relationship was also verified in vitro. Experiments about cellular invasion, migration and proliferation were performed to detect the impacts of FABP4 on the biological behaviors of colon cancer, and the positive results were checked in vivo. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FABP4 in the energy and lipid metabolism was evaluated by the levels of triglyceride, ATP, LDH, glycerol and NEFA. At last, GO and KEGG analysis based on FABP4 overexpressed cells was performed, and the AKT pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were determined by Western blot. Higher accumulation of lipids and stronger FABP4 transcription were observed in colon cancer tissues. Having been incubated with adipose tissue extract and overexpressed FABP4, colon cancer cells demonstrated enhanced lipid accumulation. In functional experiments, co-culture with adipose tissue extract significantly enhanced the invasion and migration of colon cancer cells, as well as the energy and lipid metabolism, and all these processes were reversed by FABP4 inhibitor. In addition, the metastasis of FABP4-overexpressed colon cancer cells was also significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo. In terms of mechanism, the bioinformatics analysis showed that FABP4 was enriched in 11 pathways related to metabolic processes in FABP4 overexpressed cells. Finally, FABP4 overexpression improved EMT progression of colon cancer, as evidenced by the upregulation of Snail, MMP-2 and MMP-9, the downregulation of E-cadherin. The expression of p-Akt was also elevated. FABP4 overexpression could increase FAs transport to enhance energy and lipid metabolism, and activate AKT pathway and EMT to promote the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells.","fabp4 promotes invasion and metastasis of colon cancer by regulating fatty acid transport the prognosis of colon cancer is poor for metastasis, while the mechanism, especially adipocytes related, is not yet clear. the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of fatty acid binding protein 4 (fabp4), a transporter for lipids, on colon cancer progression. the distribution of lipids and fabp4 was tested in the colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their relationship was also verified in vitro. experiments about cellular invasion, migration and proliferation were performed to detect the impacts of fabp4 on the biological behaviors of colon cancer, and the positive results were checked in vivo. meanwhile, the regulatory role of fabp4 in the energy and lipid metabolism was evaluated by the levels of triglyceride, atp, ldh, glycerol and nefa. at last, go and kegg analysis based on fabp4 overexpressed cells was performed, and",fabp promote invasion metastasis colon regulate fatty acid transport prognosis colon poor metastasis mechanism especially adipocytes relate yet clear determine effect fatty acid bind protein fabp transporter lipid colon progression distribution lipid fabp test colon tissue adjacent normal tissue relationship also verify vitro experiment cellular invasion migration proliferation perform detect impact fabp biological behavior colon positive result check vivo meanwhile regulatory role fabp energy lipid metabolism evaluate level triglyceride atp ldh glycerol nefa last go kegg base fabp overexpressed cell perform,a,Colon Cancer
"The effect of marital and insurance status on the survival of elderly patients with stage M1b colon cancer: a SEER-based study. Background Colon cancer is largely implicated in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years). The prognosis of patients diagnosed with the M1b stage is vastly poor. Marital and insurance status has been considered important prognostic factors in various cancer types. However, how these factors influence elderly patients with stage M1b colon cancer remains to be explored. This study aims to uncover the role of marital and insurance status in the survival of elderly patients with stage M1b colon cancer. Methods We retrieved data for patients diagnosed with stage M1b colon cancer between 2010 and 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Our analysis of the clinicopathological features, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was based on the marital and insurance status, respectively. Results In sum, 5709 stage M1b colon cancer patients with complete information from SEER were enrolled for analysis. The OS and CSS of the Non-married group were poorer compared to that of the Married group. The OS and CSS of the Uninsured group were poorer than both of the Insured group and Medicaid group. However, OS was comparable between Uninsured group and Medicaid groups. The findings allude that marital and insurance status potentially impact the long-term survival of elderly patients with M1b colon cancer. The subgroup survival analyses revealed the lowest risk for death among the Insured Married group based on the comparison of the OS and CSS across all other groups. Moreover, Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed race, marital status, surgery, and chemotherapy as independent predictors for OS, whereas insurance status, surgery,and chemotherapy were independent predictors for CSS in elderly patients with M1b colon cancer. Conclusion The marital and insurance status greatly impact the survival of elderly patients with M1b colon cancer. Therefore, it is imperative to provide more support to this vulnerable patient group who are lonely and uninsured, particularly in the psychological and health insurance aspect.","the effect of marital and insurance status on the survival of elderly patients with stage m1b colon cancer: a seer-based study. background colon cancer is largely implicated in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years). the prognosis of patients diagnosed with the m1b stage is vastly poor. marital and insurance status has been considered important prognostic factors in various cancer types. however, how these factors influence elderly patients with stage m1b colon cancer remains to be explored. this study aims to uncover the role of marital and insurance status in the survival of elderly patients with stage m1b colon cancer. methods we retrieved data for patients diagnosed with stage m1b colon cancer between 2010 and 2016 from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database. our analysis of the clinicopathological features, overall survival (os), and cancer-specific survival (css) was based on the marital and insurance status, respectively. results in sum, 5709",effect marital insurance status survival elderly stage b colon seer base colon largely implicate elderly age year prognosis diagnose b stage vastly poor marital insurance status consider important prognostic factor various type however factor influence elderly stage b colon remain explore uncover role marital insurance status survival elderly stage b colon method retrieve data diagnose stage b colon surveillance epidemiology end result seer database clinicopathological feature overall survival specific survival cs base marital insurance status respectively result sum,a,Colon Cancer
"Cracking the Code of Colorectal Cancer Screening: An Overview With a Focus on Current and Emerging Screening Methods. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer that affects the colon and rectum. It is a major cause of cancer-related mortality. A complicated interaction between environmental and genetic factors, such as age, diet, gut microbiota, obesity, chronic inflammation, and familial predisposition, appears to contribute to the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer. A multidisciplinary strategy is necessary for the effective care of CRC, including early detection through screening, surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted medicines. The slow progression of CRC through various stages gives us, physicians, leverage and a chance to promptly and adequately screen a patient and give them a better chance at life. There are multiple clinical trials being conducted to find better and the best screening and treatment modalities. Existing and emerging screening tests can be broadly divided into blood-based, stool-based and direct imaging-based screening tests. Colonoscopy is the gold standard. However, numerous emerging screening tests are changing the face of colon cancer screening. This review aims to highlight the background of CRC, including its etiopathogenesis, risk factors, and clinical features. It will also shed light on the existing and emerging screening techniques that will decide the future of this deadly cancer. In addition, the management section of this article will provide a summary of suggestions, including radiation and medical and surgical treatment modalities that may benefit physicians in managing this challenging condition. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed-indexed journals using the terms ""Colorectal Cancer,"" ""Etiopathogenesis of CRC,"" and ""Emerging screening and treatment modalities in CRC."" We explored the literature on the background of CRC, its pathogenesis, the importance of screening, screening modalities and comparisons amongst each one, and treatment options for this challenging cancer. We used peer-reviewed original research articles and systematic reviews published in English, conducted from 2015 to the present time, to reflect the developments in colorectal cancer. Studies with uncertain methodological details and outcomes were excluded.","cracking the code of colorectal cancer screening: an overview with a focus on current and emerging screening methods. colorectal cancer (crc) is a common cancer that affects the colon and rectum. it is a major cause of cancer-related mortality. a complicated interaction between environmental and genetic factors, such as age, diet, gut microbiota, obesity, chronic inflammation, and familial predisposition, appears to contribute to the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer. a multidisciplinary strategy is necessary for the effective care of crc, including early detection through screening, surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted medicines. the slow progression of crc through various stages gives us, physicians, leverage and a chance to promptly and adequately screen a patient and give them a better chance at life. there are multiple clinical trials being conducted to find better and the best screening and treatment modalities. existing and emerging screening tests can be broadly divided into blood-based,",crack code colorectal screen overview focus current emerge screen method colorectal crc common affect colon rectum major cause relate mortality complicate interaction environmental genetic factor age diet gut microbiota obesity chronic inflammation familial predisposition appear contribute pathophysiology colorectal multidisciplinary strategy necessary effective care crc include early detection screen surgical resection chemotherapy radiation therapy target medicine slow progression crc various stage give u physicians leverage chance promptly adequately screen give good chance life multiple trial conduct find good best screening modality exist emerge screen test broadly divide blood base,a,Colon Cancer

"Prognostic value of hedgehog signaling pathway in patients with colon cancer Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in normal mammalian gastrointestinal development and is implicated in the oncogenesis of various tumors. However, its correlation with progression and prognosis of colon cancer has not been well documented. This study was designed to investigate expression patterns of related proteins in hedgehog signaling pathway in colon cancer to elucidate its prognostic value in this tumor. Using human colon cancer and their corresponding non-diseased colon from 228 patients' biopsies, the expression of sonic hedgehog, its receptor Patched, and downstream transcription factor Gli1 was investigated by immunohistochemical staining to assess their association with the clinicopathological characteristics of colon cancer. Disease-free survival and overall survival were examined by Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate Cox analysis. One hundred and thirty-eight patients (59.6%) had sonic hedgehog-positive tumors and that the disease-free survival (43.5 vs. 73.3%, P < 0.001), and overall survival rates (50.7 vs. 88.9%, P < 0.001) of patients with sonic hedgehog-positive tumors were much lower than those of patients with sonic hedgehog-negative tumors. In addition, 163 patients (71.5%) had Patched-positive tumors, and the disease-free survival (41.7 vs. 76.9%, P < 0.001) and overall survival rates (55.2 vs. 80.0%, P = 0.002) of patients with Patched-positive tumors were also lower than those of patients with Patched-negative tumors. Moreover, positive Gli1 expression had a bad effect on the disease-free survival (41.9 vs. 73.2%, P < 0.001) and overall survival rate of patients with colon cancer (50.0 vs. 89.3%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, sonic hedgehog, Patched, and Gli1 status were indicators for poor disease-free survival and overall survival. These results have shown that the increasing expression of sonic hedgehog, Patched, and Gli1 are indicators for a poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer.

"Pre-colectomy location and TNM staging of colon cancer by the computed tomography colonography: a diagnostic performance study The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines 2018 and the recent update of that (version 2020) recommends accurate examination before major treatment for decision(s) in cases of colon cancer. Also, the difficulty in the identification of the lesion during colectomy may lead to resection of a wrong segment of the colon or a more extensive resection than planned. Accurate pre-colectomy local staging of colon cancer is required to make decisions for treatment of colon cancer. The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the computed tomography colonography (CTC) for pre-colectomy tumor location and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging of colon cancer. Data of preoperative colonoscopies, CTC, surgeries, and surgical pathology of a total of 269 patients diagnosed with colon cancer by colonoscopy and biopsy and underwent pre-colectomy location and TNM staging by CTC were collected and analyzed. The consistency between the radiological and the surgery/surgical-pathological for location and TN stages of colon tumor were estimated with the weighted kappa or kappa coefficient (κ) at 95% confidence interval (CI).

"A cross-sectional study on the association between physical activity and the risk of colon cancer based on NHANES 2007-2018. Colon cancer poses a significant threat to global health, and studies have shown a correlation between physical activity (PA) and the incidence of colon cancer. However, existing research has not quantitatively analyzed PA to evaluate its impact on the risk of colon cancer comprehensively. Data related to the study were obtained from the NHANES database for participants aged 20 and above between 2007 and 2018. Calculate the daily total metabolic equivalent (MET) based on the duration of different physical activities for each participant, use multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between PA and colon cancer risk, perform subgroup analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between different subgroups, and use RCS regression analysis to evaluate the non-linear relationship between MET and colon cancer risk. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that compared with the overall data of the participants in this study, the OR of the low PA group (PA ≤ 120MET/day) was 1.224 (95% CI 1.031-1.453, P = 0.023), the OR of the mild PA group (120 < PA ≤ 600MET/day) was 1.026 (95%CI 0.707-1.488, P = 0.894), the OR of the moderate intensity PA group (600 < PA ≤ 1200MET/day) was 0.798 (95% CI 0.506-1.258, P = 0.334), and the OR of the high-intensity PA group (PA > 1200MET/day) was 0.470 (95% CI 0.249-0.885, P = 0.022), these results are consistent in subgroup analysis. The RCS regression analysis results showed a significant nonlinear relationship between MET and the risk of colon cancer(p < 0.001), with an inflection point observed at 1879 MET/day on the correlation curve. Low physical activity increases the risk of colon cancer, while moderate to high-intensity physical activity can reduce the risk of colon cancer.

"Metastatic colon cancer of the small intestine diagnosed using genetic analysis: a case report Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma is widely detected in the gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, lower respiratory and urinary systems. Determining the nature (monoclonal or multicentric) of the intestinal adenocarcinoma is sometimes a diagnostic challenge owing to its occurrence at various locations of the body, especially in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Herein, we successfully diagnosed metastatic colon cancer in the small intestine using tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) mutation analysis. An 83-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain and nausea at the emergency department of the hospital. Her history included surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for colon and breast cancers. Abdominal computed tomography revealed small intestinal dilation, which was associated with the mural nodule detected on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Laparoscopy-assisted small bowel resection was performed based on the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, probably due to recurrence of the colon or breast cancer. Macroscopically, an ulcerated tumor was present in the resected small intestine. Histologically, the cancer cells showed infiltrative growth of colonic dysplastic glands, whose non-specific finding made it difficult to determine the relationship with past colon cancers. Retrospective pathological examination confirmed that the previous breast and colon carcinomas were primary cancers. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the small intestinal and colon cancer cells showed diffuse positive tumor protein 53 (p53) expression. However, the breast cancer cells showed only weakly positive p53 expression. In addition, TP53 mutational analysis detected an identical missense mutation (p.T211I) between the two intestinal cancers. Moreover, further molecular genetic work-up revealed that both small intestinal and colon adenocarcinomas harbored an identical missense mutation (p.G12D) of KRAS gene. In conclusion, the small intestinal cancer in this case was identified as a metastatic adenocarcinoma arising from a past colon cancer.

E. coli O22:H8 was found to be prevalent in the gut of mice and exhibited lower virulence compared to O91:H21. Germ-free (GF) mice that were pre-orally inoculated with E. coli O22:H8 showed reduced susceptibility to chemically induced colitis, increased proliferation of epithelial cells, and improved mouse survival.

"STI571 reduces TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells: c-Abl activation by the death receptor leads to stress kinase-dependent cell death In an effort to achieve better cancer therapies, we elucidated the combination cancer therapy of STI571 (an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and clinically used for chronic myelogenous leukemia) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, a developing antitumor agent) in leukemia, colon, and prostate cancer cells. Colon cancer (HCT116, SW480), prostate cancer (PC3, LNCaP) and leukemia (K562) cells were treated with STI571 and TRAIL. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and sub-G1 appearance. Protein expression and kinase phosphorylation were determined by Western blotting. c-Abl and p73 activities were inhibited by target-specific small interfering (si)RNA. In vitro kinase assay of c-Abl was conducted using CRK as a substrate. We found that STI571 exerts opposite effects on the antitumor activity of TRAIL. It enhanced cytotoxicity in TRAIL-treated K562 leukemia cells and reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells, while having no effect on PC3 and LNCaP cells. In colon and prostate cancer cells, TRAIL caused c-Abl cleavage to the active form via a caspase pathway. Interestingly, JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors effectively blocked TRAIL-induced toxicity in the colon, but not in prostate cancer cells. Next, we found that STI571 could attenuate TRAIL-induced c-Abl, JNK and p38 activation in HCT116 cells. In addition, siRNA targeting knockdown of c-Abl and p73 also reduced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, rendering HCT116 cells less responsive to stress kinase activation, and masking the cytoprotective effect of STI571. All together we demonstrate a novel mediator role of p73 in activating the stress kinases p38 and JNK in the classical apoptotic pathway of TRAIL. TRAIL via caspase-dependent action can sequentially activate c-Abl, p73, and stress kinases, which contribute to apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Through the inhibition of c-Abl-mediated apoptotic p73 signaling, STI571 reduces the antitumor activity of TRAIL in colon cancer cells. Our results raise additional concerns when developing combination cancer therapy with TRAIL and STI571 in the future.","sti571 reduces trail-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells: c-abl activation by the death receptor leads to stress kinase-dependent cell death in an effort to achieve better cancer therapies, we elucidated the combination cancer therapy of sti571 (an inhibitor of bcr-abl and clinically used for chronic myelogenous leukemia) and tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail, a developing antitumor agent) in leukemia, colon, and prostate cancer cells. colon cancer (hct116, sw480), prostate cancer (pc3, lncap) and leukemia (k562) cells were treated with sti571 and trail. cell viability was determined by mtt assay and sub-g1 appearance. protein expression and kinase phosphorylation were determined by western blotting. c-abl and p73 activities were inhibited by target-specific small interfering (si)rna. in vitro kinase assay of c-abl was conducted using crk as a substrate. we found that sti571 exerts opposite effects on the antitumor activity of trail. it enhanced cytotoxicity in trail-treated k562 leukemia cells and reduced trail-induced apoptosis",sti reduces trail induce apoptosis colon cell c abl activation death receptor lead stress kinase dependent cell death effort achieve good therapies elucidate combination therapy sti inhibitor bcr abl clinically use chronic myelogenous leukemia tnf relate apoptosis induce ligand trail develop antitumor agent leukemia colon prostate cell colon hct sw prostate pc lncap leukemia k cell treat sti trail cell viability determine mtt assay sub g appearance protein expression kinase phosphorylation determine western blot c abl p activity inhibit target specific small interfering si rna vitro kinase assay c abl conduct use crk substrate find sti exerts opposite effect antitumor activity trail enhance cytotoxicity trail treat k leukemia cell reduced trail induce apoptosis,a,Colon Cancer

"Integrated multi-omics unveils novel immune signature for predicting prognosis in colon cancer patients. Colon cancer, a prevalent malignancy, is subject to intricate immune modulation, which substantially affects both treatment efficacy and prognostic outcomes. Furthermore, colon cancer is highly heterogeneous, and our comprehensive understanding of its immune microenvironment has not yet been fully realized. There is still ample opportunity for in-depth investigation into the composition and interactions of immune cells within colon cancer, as well as their implications for disease prognosis. In this study, we employed single-cell data from colon cancer to distinguish immune cells from non-immune cells through cluster analysis. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of myeloid and T cells, which were categorized into 20 distinct cell subpopulations. Functional enrichment analysis revealed T cells' active involvement in the Fatty Acid Metabolism and Adipogenesis pathways, while immune checkpoint-associated genes (ICGs) were notably upregulated in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Subsequent analysis involved calculating gene scores to characterize cell subpopulations, which, when combined with patient survival time analysis, revealed a significant association between the gene characterization score (referred to as ""imm-score"") and the survival of colon cancer patients. Specifically, the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup>-ANXA1<sup>hi</sup>-T cells was linked to shortened overall survival in the high imm-score subgroup. Subsequently, combined with genomic analysis, patients in the high imm-score subgroup exhibited elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB) and heightened activity in both the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Notch signaling pathway. Finally, according to our new algorithm, scores calculated predicted the effectiveness of immunotherapy for patients. The results revealed that patients with lower scores could achieve better therapeutic outcomes with immunotherapy. This study offers an extensive analysis of the interplay between T cells and myeloid cells within colon cancer tissues, exploring their impact on the survival and prognosis of colon cancer patients. Additionally, it unveils the potential significance of the imm-score in colon cancer, potentially indicating a poor prognosis and providing novel insights into the immune-regulatory mechanisms underlying the disease.","integrated multi-omics unveils novel immune signature for predicting prognosis in colon cancer patients. colon cancer, a prevalent malignancy, is subject to intricate immune modulation, which substantially affects both treatment efficacy and prognostic outcomes. furthermore, colon cancer is highly heterogeneous, and our comprehensive understanding of its immune microenvironment has not yet been fully realized. there is still ample opportunity for in-depth investigation into the composition and interactions of immune cells within colon cancer, as well as their implications for disease prognosis. in this study, we employed single-cell data from colon cancer to distinguish immune cells from non-immune cells through cluster analysis. furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of myeloid and t cells, which were categorized into 20 distinct cell subpopulations. functional enrichment analysis revealed t cells' active involvement in the fatty acid metabolism and adipogenesis pathways, while immune checkpoint-associated genes (icgs) were notably upregulated in cd8 + t cells. subsequent analysis",integrate multi omics unveils novel immune signature predict prognosis colon colon prevalent malignancy subject intricate immune modulation substantially affect efficacy prognostic outcome furthermore colon highly heterogeneous comprehensive understanding immune microenvironment yet fully realize still ample opportunity depth investigation composition interaction immune cell within colon well implication prognosis employ single cell data colon distinguish immune cell non immune cell cluster furthermore conduct depth myeloid cell categorize distinct cell subpopulation functional enrichment reveal cell active involvement fatty acid metabolism adipogenesis pathway immune checkpoint associate gene icgs notably upregulated cd cell subsequent,a,Colon Cancer
"An Enhancement of Computer Aided Approach for Colon Cancer Detection in WCE Images Using ROI Based Color Histogram and SVM2. The colon cancer is formed by uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in large intestine or colon that can affect both men and women and it is third cancer disease in the world. At present, Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) screening method is utilized to identify colon cancer tumor at early stage to save the patient life who affected by the colon cancer. In this CTC method, the radiologist needs to analyze the colon polyps in digital image using computer aided approach with accurate automatic tumor classification to detect the cancer tumor at early stage. This kind of computer aided approach can operate as an intermediate between input digital image and radiologist. Therefore, in this paper, a novel computer aided approach is presented with ROI based color histogram and SVM2 to find the cancer tumor in WCE image. In this method, the digital WCE image can be preprocessed using filtering and ROI based color histogram depending on the salient region in colon. In common, the salient region can be distinctive because of low redundancy. Hence, the saliency is estimated by ROI based color histogram on the basis of color and structure contrast in given colon image for the further process of clustering and tumor classification in WCE image. The K-means clustering can be employed to cluster the preprocessed digital image to discover the tumor of colon. Subsequently, the features are extracted from the image in terms of contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity by applying SGLDM method. The SVM2 classifier as input to classify the tumor is normal or malignancy using selected feature vectors. Here, the extracted features can also being combined to enhance the hybrid feature vector for the accurate tumor classification. Experimental results of proposed method can show that this presented technique can executes can tumor detection in colon image accurately reaching almost 95% in evaluation with existing algorithms.","an enhancement of computer aided approach for colon cancer detection in wce images using roi based color histogram and svm2. the colon cancer is formed by uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in large intestine or colon that can affect both men and women and it is third cancer disease in the world. at present, wireless capsule endoscopy (wce) screening method is utilized to identify colon cancer tumor at early stage to save the patient life who affected by the colon cancer. in this ctc method, the radiologist needs to analyze the colon polyps in digital image using computer aided approach with accurate automatic tumor classification to detect the cancer tumor at early stage. this kind of computer aided approach can operate as an intermediate between input digital image and radiologist. therefore, in this paper, a novel computer aided approach is presented with roi based color histogram and svm2 to find",enhancement computer aid approach colon detection wce image use roi base color histogram svm colon form uncontrollable growth abnormal cell large intestine colon affect men woman third world present wireless capsule endoscopy wce screen method utilize identify colon early stage save life affect colon ctc method radiologist need analyze colon polyp digital image use computer aid approach accurate automatic classification detect early stage kind computer aid approach operate intermediate input digital image radiologist therefore paper novel computer aid approach present roi base color histogram svm find,a,Colon Cancer

"ZIC5, a survival biomarker, facilitates tumor progression and stemness in colon cancer via the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Colorectal cancer (CRC), a highly heterogeneous disease, is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. Mounting evidence has indicated that the zinc finger of the cerebellum 5 (ZIC5) is involved in the pathological processes of cancer. At present, there are few and conflicting studies on ZIC5 in CRC. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical value, function and molecular mechanism of ZIC5 in colon cancer. ZIC5 expression analysis in pan-cancer was performed using the TCGA database. The correlation of ZIC5 expression with clinicopathologic parameters of colon cancer was assessed in public and external datasets, respectively. The influence of ZIC5 expression on survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve and Cox regression models. In addition, a series of in vitro experiments on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and stemness were performed to further explore the function and potential mechanisms of ZIC5 in colon cancer. ZIC5 mRNA expression is significantly elevated in the vast majority of cancers. We found that ZIC5 is elevated in colon cancer tissues, and high ZIC5 expression was associated with poorer survival of colon cancer patients. ZIC5 expression was positively correlated with the malignant pathological phenotype, and it's an independent risk marker for the overall survival (OS) of colon cancer patients. We demonstrated that ZIC5 promoted proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT of colon cancer cells. Additionally, ZIC5 enhances colon cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Mechanistically, ZIC5 functions in colon cancer cells by upregulating Wnt signaling. ZIC5 could enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling by interacting with β-catenin. Interestingly, in HCT116 cells, ZIC5 doesn't affect the protein level of β-catenin and its nuclear translocation likely due to the deletion mutation of β-catenin at Ser45. We identified ZIC5 as a survival marker for colon cancer patients. Our study shows that inhibition of ZIC5 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.","zic5, a survival biomarker, facilitates tumor progression and stemness in colon cancer via the activation of the wnt signaling pathway. colorectal cancer (crc), a highly heterogeneous disease, is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. mounting evidence has indicated that the zinc finger of the cerebellum 5 (zic5) is involved in the pathological processes of cancer. at present, there are few and conflicting studies on zic5 in crc. the aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical value, function and molecular mechanism of zic5 in colon cancer. zic5 expression analysis in pan-cancer was performed using the tcga database. the correlation of zic5 expression with clinicopathologic parameters of colon cancer was assessed in public and external datasets, respectively. the influence of zic5 expression on survival was analyzed by kaplan-meier (km) curve and cox regression models. in addition, a series of in vitro experiments on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and",zic survival biomarker facilitate progression stemness colon via activation wnt signal pathway colorectal crc highly heterogeneous second leading cause relate death mount evidence indicate zinc finger cerebellum zic involve pathological process present conflict zic crc elucidate value function molecular mechanism zic colon zic expression pan perform use tcga database correlation zic expression clinicopathologic parameter colon assess public external datasets respectively influence zic expression survival analyze kaplan meier km curve cox regression model addition series vitro experiment cell proliferation invasion migration,a,Colon Cancer
"Genomic instability and colon cancer. Colorectal cancer affected ∼135,000 people in the United States in 2001, resulting in 57,000 deaths. At the cellular level, colorectal cancer results from the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells to colon adenocarcinoma cells. The loss of genomic stability appears to be a key molecular and pathogenetic step that occurs early in the tumorigenesis process and serves to create a permissive environment for the occurrence of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. At least three forms of genomic instability have been identified in colon cancer: (1) microsatellite instability (MSI), (2) chromosome instability (i.e. aneusomy, gains and losses of chromosomal regions) (CIN), and (3) chromosomal translocations. Microsatellite instability occurs in ∼15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the mutation mismatch repair (MMR) system by either MMR gene mutations or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. MSI promotes tumorigenesis through generating mutations in target genes that possess coding microsatellite repeats, such as TGFBR2 and BAX. CIN is found in the majority of colon cancers and leads to a different pattern of gene alterations that contribute to tumor formation. CIN appears to result primarily from deregulation of the DNA replication checkpoints and mitotic-spindle checkpoints. The mechanisms that induce and influence genomic instability in cancer in general and more specifically in colon cancer are only partly understood and are consequently under intense investigation. These studies have revealed mutation of the mitotic checkpoint regulators BUB1 and BUBR1 and amplification of STK15 in a subset of CIN colon cancers. The etiology of CIN in the other unexplained cases of colon cancer remains to be determined. Hopefully, discovery of the cause and specific role of genomic instability in colon cancer will yield more effective chemotherapy strategies that take advantage of this unique characteristic of cancer cells.","genomic instability and colon cancer. colorectal cancer affected ∼135,000 people in the united states in 2001, resulting in 57,000 deaths. at the cellular level, colorectal cancer results from the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells to colon adenocarcinoma cells. the loss of genomic stability appears to be a key molecular and pathogenetic step that occurs early in the tumorigenesis process and serves to create a permissive environment for the occurrence of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. at least three forms of genomic instability have been identified in colon cancer: (1) microsatellite instability (msi), (2) chromosome instability (i.e. aneusomy, gains and losses of chromosomal regions) (cin), and (3) chromosomal translocations. microsatellite instability occurs in ∼15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the mutation mismatch repair (mmr) system by either mmr gene mutations or hypermethylation of the",genomic instability colon colorectal affect people united state result death cellular level colorectal result progressive accumulation genetic epigenetic alteration lead transformation normal colonic epithelial cell colon adenocarcinoma cell loss genomic stability appear key molecular pathogenetic step occur early tumorigenesis process serf create permissive environment occurrence alteration suppressor gene oncogene least three form genomic instability identify colon microsatellite instability msi chromosome instability e aneusomy gain loss chromosomal region cin chromosomal translocation microsatellite instability occur colon result inactivation mutation mismatch repair mmr system either mmr gene mutation hypermethylation,a,Colon Cancer

"Early onset MSI-H colon cancer with MLH1 promoter methylation, is there a genetic predisposition? To investigate the etiology of MLH1 promoter methylation in mismatch repair (MMR) mutation-negative early onset MSI-H colon cancer. As this type of colon cancer is associated with high ages, young patients bearing this type of malignancy are rare and could provide additional insight into the etiology of sporadic MSI-H colon cancer. We studied a set of 46 MSI-H colon tumors cases with MLH1 promoter methylation which was enriched for patients with an age of onset below 50 years (n = 13). Tumors were tested for CIMP marker methylation and mutations linked to methylation: BRAF, KRAS, GADD45A and the MLH1 -93G>A polymorphism. When available, normal colon and leukocyte DNA was tested for GADD45A mutations and germline MLH1 methylation. SNP array analysis was performed on a subset of tumors. We identified two cases (33 and 60 years) with MLH1 germline promoter methylation. BRAF mutations were less frequent in colon cancer patients below 50 years relative to patients above 50 years (p-value: 0.044). CIMP-high was infrequent and related to BRAF mutations in patients below 50 years. In comparison with published controls the G>A polymorphism was associated with our cohort. Although similar distribution of the pathogenic A allele was observed in the patients with an age of onset above and below 50 years, the significance for the association was lost for the group under 50 years. GADD45A sequencing yielded an unclassified variant. Tumors from both age groups showed infrequent copy number changes and loss-of-heterozygosity. Somatic or germline GADD45A mutations did not explain sporadic MSI-H colon cancer. Although germline MLH1 methylation was found in two individuals, locus-specific somatic MLH1 hypermethylation explained the majority of sporadic early onset MSI-H colon cancer cases. Our data do not suggest an intrinsic tendency for CpG island hypermethylation in these early onset MSI-H tumors other than through somatic mutation of BRAF.","early onset msi-h colon cancer with mlh1 promoter methylation, is there a genetic predisposition? to investigate the etiology of mlh1 promoter methylation in mismatch repair (mmr) mutation-negative early onset msi-h colon cancer. as this type of colon cancer is associated with high ages, young patients bearing this type of malignancy are rare and could provide additional insight into the etiology of sporadic msi-h colon cancer. we studied a set of 46 msi-h colon tumors cases with mlh1 promoter methylation which was enriched for patients with an age of onset below 50 years (n = 13). tumors were tested for cimp marker methylation and mutations linked to methylation: braf, kras, gadd45a and the mlh1 -93g>a polymorphism. when available, normal colon and leukocyte dna was tested for gadd45a mutations and germline mlh1 methylation. snp array analysis was performed on a subset of tumors. we identified two cases (33 and 60 years) with",early onset msi h colon mlh promoter methylation genetic predisposition investigate etiology mlh promoter methylation mismatch repair mmr mutation negative early onset msi h colon type colon associate high age young bear type malignancy rare could provide additional insight etiology sporadic msi h colon set msi h colon mlh promoter methylation enrich age onset year n test cimp marker methylation mutation link methylation braf kras gadd mlh g polymorphism available normal colon leukocyte dna test gadd mutation germline mlh methylation snp array perform subset identify two year,a,Colon Cancer

"A weight-of-evidence review of colorectal cancer in pesticide applicators: the agricultural health study and other epidemiologic studies To systematically evaluate epidemiologic studies on pesticides and colon cancer and rectal cancer in agricultural pesticide applicator populations using a transparent “weight-of-evidence” (WOE) methodological approach. Twenty-nine (29) publications from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) and 13 additional epidemiologic studies were identified that reported data for pesticide applicators and/or specific pesticide compounds and colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer. The AHS evaluated pesticide applicators as well as dose–response associations for specific pesticide compounds, whereas the large majority of non-AHS evaluated applicators but did not analyze specific compounds or dose–response trends. This WOE assessment of 153 different pesticide–outcome pairs emphasized several key evidentiary features: existence of statistically significant relative risks, magnitude of observed associations, results from the most reliable exposure assessments, and evidence of convincing dose–response relationships (i.e., those monotonically increasing, with statistically significant trend tests). Occupation as a pesticide applicator or pesticide application as a farming-related function was not associated with increasing the risk of colon or rectal cancer. Deficits of colon or rectal cancer were observed across most studies of pesticide applicators. After applying the WOE methodology to the epidemiologic studies of specific pesticide compounds and colon or rectal cancer, a number of pesticide–outcome pairs were identified and evaluated further based on positive statistical associations. Of these, only two—aldicarb and colon cancer and imazethapyr and proximal colon cancer—appears to warrant further discussion regarding a possible causal relationship, although the epidemiologic data are limited. For the remainder, a lack of a clear dose–response trend, inconsistencies in associations between exposure metrics and comparison groups, imprecise associations, variable participation rates for analyses of specific compounds, and the reliance upon data from one study (the AHS) limit interpretation regarding risk. The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between occupation as a pesticide applicator or specific pesticide exposures and colon or rectal cancer.","a weight-of-evidence review of colorectal cancer in pesticide applicators: the agricultural health study and other epidemiologic studies to systematically evaluate epidemiologic studies on pesticides and colon cancer and rectal cancer in agricultural pesticide applicator populations using a transparent “weight-of-evidence” (woe) methodological approach. twenty-nine (29) publications from the agricultural health study (ahs) and 13 additional epidemiologic studies were identified that reported data for pesticide applicators and/or specific pesticide compounds and colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer. the ahs evaluated pesticide applicators as well as dose–response associations for specific pesticide compounds, whereas the large majority of non-ahs evaluated applicators but did not analyze specific compounds or dose–response trends. this woe assessment of 153 different pesticide–outcome pairs emphasized several key evidentiary features: existence of statistically significant relative risks, magnitude of observed associations, results from the most reliable exposure assessments, and evidence of convincing dose–response relationships (i.e., those monotonically increasing, with statistically significant trend tests).",weight evidence review colorectal pesticide applicator agricultural health epidemiologic systematically evaluate epidemiologic pesticide colon rectal agricultural pesticide applicator population use transparent weight evidence woe methodological approach twenty nine publication agricultural health ahs additional epidemiologic identify report data pesticide applicator specific pesticide compound colorectal colon rectal ahs evaluate pesticide applicator well dose response association specific pesticide compound whereas large majority non ahs evaluate applicator analyze specific compound dose response trend woe assessment different pesticide outcome pair emphasize several key evidentiary feature existence statistically significant relative risk magnitude observed association result reliable exposure assessment evidence convince dose response relationship e monotonically increase statistically significant trend test,a,Colon Cancer
"Safety and effectiveness of high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery for cancer of the descending colon under indocyanine green fluorescence imaging: a pilot study Complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation is a standard advanced technique for achieving favorable long-term oncological outcomes in colon cancer surgery. Clinical evidence abounds demonstrating the safety of high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) for sigmoid colon cancer but is scarce for descending colon cancer. A major concern is the blood supply to the remnant distal sigmoid colon, especially for cases with a long sigmoid colon. We sought to clarify the safety and feasibility of high ligation of the IMA in surgery for descending colon cancer using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. In this prospective single-center pilot study, we examined 20 patients with descending colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic colectomy between April 2018 and September 2019. Following full mobilization and division of the proximal colonic mesentery, we temporarily clamped the root of the IMA and performed ICG fluorescence imaging of the blood flow to the sigmoid colon. The postoperative anastomosis-related complications (primary endpoint) and length of viable remnant colon, and the number of lymph nodes retrieved (secondary endpoints) were evaluated and compared with historical controls who underwent conventional IMA-preserving surgery (n = 20). Blood flow reached 40 (17–66) cm retrograde from the peritoneal reflection, even after IMA clamping. Accordingly, IMA high ligation was performed in all cases. No anastomotic anastomosis-related complications occurred in each group. Retrieved total lymph nodes were higher in number in the ICG-guided group than in the conventional group (p = 0.035). Specifically, more principal nodes were retrieved in the ICG-guided group, compared with the conventional group (p = 0.023). However, the distal margin was not as long compared with the conventional group. We demonstrated the safety and feasibility of high ligation of the IMA for descending colon cancer without sacrificing additional distal colon using fluorescence evaluation of blood flow in the remnant colon.","safety and effectiveness of high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery for cancer of the descending colon under indocyanine green fluorescence imaging: a pilot study complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation is a standard advanced technique for achieving favorable long-term oncological outcomes in colon cancer surgery. clinical evidence abounds demonstrating the safety of high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (ima) for sigmoid colon cancer but is scarce for descending colon cancer. a major concern is the blood supply to the remnant distal sigmoid colon, especially for cases with a long sigmoid colon. we sought to clarify the safety and feasibility of high ligation of the ima in surgery for descending colon cancer using indocyanine green (icg) fluorescence imaging. in this prospective single-center pilot study, we examined 20 patients with descending colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic colectomy between april 2018 and september 2019. following full mobilization and division of",safety effectiveness high ligation inferior mesenteric artery descend colon indocyanine green fluorescence image pilot complete mesocolic excision central vascular ligation standard advanced technique achieve favorable long term oncological outcome colon surgery evidence abound demonstrate safety high ligation inferior mesenteric artery ima sigmoid colon scarce descend colon major concern blood supply remnant distal sigmoid colon especially long sigmoid colon seek clarify safety feasibility high ligation ima surgery descend colon use indocyanine green icg fluorescence imaging prospective single center pilot examine descend colon undergo laparoscopic colectomy april september follow full mobilization division,a,Colon Cancer

"Wnt3a expression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes colon cancer progression Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the progression and metastasis of cancer cells and is associated with a more invasive phenotype of cancer. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is one of the major pathways involved in EMT regulation. Many studies provide evidence that β-catenin, the key regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is important in regulating EMT in cancer. However, the roles of Wnt3a, the representative canonical Wnt ligand, in EMT and colon cancer progression have not yet been fully explored. The expression levels of Wnt3a and EMT-associated proteins (E-cadherin, vimentin, and β-catenin) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in human colon cancer tissues to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of Wnt3a, as well as the correlation between Wnt3a and EMT. We then upregulated Wnt3a expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells, established a nude mouse xenograft model, detected the expression of EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling-associated proteins, and observed invasion and clone-initiating abilities. In 203 human colon cancer tissue samples, Wnt3a protein overexpression was related to colon cancer histological differentiation (P = 0.004), clinical stage (P = 0.008), presence of metastasis and recurrence (P = 0.036), and survival time (P = 0.007) of colon cancer patients. Wnt3a expression was notably concomitant with EMT immunohistochemical features, such as reduced expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (P = 0.012), increased expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin (P = 0.002), and cytoplasmic distribution of β-catenin (P = 0.021). Results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that Wnt3a overexpression could alter cell morphology, regulate EMT-associated protein expression, and enhance clone-initiation and invasion. Dkk1 (antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling) could also partially reverse the expression of EMT-associated proteins in Wnt3a-overexpressing cells.

"Better survival in right-sided versus left-sided stage I - III colon cancer patients The distinction between right-sided and left-sided colon cancer has recently received considerable attention due to differences regarding underlying genetic mutations. There is an ongoing debate if right- versus left-sided tumor location itself represents an independent prognostic factor. We aimed to investigate this question by using propensity score matching. Patients with resected, stage I - III colon cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004–2012). Both univariable and multivariable Cox regression as well as propensity score matching were used. Overall, 91,416 patients (51,937 [56.8 %] with right-sided, 39,479 [43.2 %] with left-sided colon cancer; median follow-up 38 months) were eligible. In univariable analysis, patients with right-sided cancer had worse overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32, 95 % CI:1.29–1.36, P < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.26, 95 % CI:1.21–1.30, P < 0.001) compared to patients with left-sided cancer. After propensity score matching, the prognosis of right-sided carcinomas was better regarding overall (HR = 0.92, 95 % CI: 0.89 − 0.94, P < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.90, 95 % CI:0.87 − 0.93, P < 0.001). In stage I and II, the prognosis of right-sided cancer was better for overall (HR = 0.89, 95 % CI:0.84–0.94 and HR = 0.85, 95 % CI:0.81–0.89) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.71, 95 % CI:0.64 − 0.79 and HR = 0.75, 95 % CI:0.70–0.80).

Patients who underwent MIS, including CLS and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS), for left-sided CRC between April 2016 and June 2019, were investigated. PDM was defined as the existence of the right border of the descending colon inside the right border of the left kidney based on preoperative computed tomography findings. Radiological findings of 837 patients were examined, and PDM was found in 19 (2.3%) patients. Radiality of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was found in 5 of 19 (26.3%) PDM cases, which was significantly higher than that in non-PDM cases. The median lengths between the IMA and inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and between the IMV and descending colon in PDM cases were 14.8 mm and 17.2 mm, respectively, which were significantly shorter than those in non-PDM cases. Short-term outcomes were evaluated only in CLS cases since the rate of hybrid surgery among RALS cases differed between non-PDM and PDM cases (0% vs. 44.4%), which would affect the surgical outcomes. The short-term outcomes in 447 CLS cases were similar between PDM and non-PDM cases. The frequency of extracorporeal division of the left colic artery (LCA) and IMV was significantly higher in PDM than in non-PDM cases (70.0% vs. 5.7%). This radiological definition of PDM was feasible. CLS for left-sided CRC with PDM was feasible, and dividing the LCA and IMV extracorporeally would be vital for safe surgery.","minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon: radiological findings and short-term outcomes persistent descending mesocolon (pdm) is typically asymptomatic. however, features such as adhesion and variations in vessel anatomy could affect the surgical techniques for colorectal cancer (crc). this study aimed to investigate the frequency and radiological features of pdm. short-term outcomes after conventional laparoscopic surgery (cls) for crc with pdm were also investigated to assess the feasibility of cls and identify strategies for minimally invasive surgery (mis) in crc with pdm. patients who underwent mis, including cls and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (rals), for left-sided crc between april 2016 and june 2019, were investigated. pdm was defined as the existence of the right border of the descending colon inside the right border of the left kidney based on preoperative computed tomography findings. radiological findings of 837 patients were examined, and pdm was found in 19 (2.3%) patients.",minimally invasive surgery colorectal persistent descend mesocolon radiological finding short term outcome persistent descend mesocolon pdm typically asymptomatic however feature adhesion variation vessel anatomy could affect surgical technique colorectal crc investigate frequency radiological feature pdm short term outcome conventional laparoscopic surgery cl crc pdm also investigate assess feasibility cl identify strategy minimally invasive surgery mi crc pdm undergo mi include cl robot assist laparoscopic surgery rals left side crc april june investigate pdm define existence right border descend colon inside right border left kidney base preoperative compute tomography finding radiological finding examine pdm find,a,Colon Cancer

"Cardiovascular medication use and risks of colon cancer recurrences and additional cancer events: a cohort study. Cardiovascular medications may be associated with cancer development, but little is known about their association with cancer recurrence. Medications such as statins and antihypertensives may be commonly used among colon cancer survivors, who are, on average, diagnosed in their mid-60s. We described the associations between statins and antihypertensive medications and colon cancer recurrence in a large, population-based study. We conducted a cohort study among adults with stage I-IIIA colon cancer diagnosed in 1995–2014 in two Kaiser Permanente regions, Colorado and Washington. Statin and antihypertensive use were obtained from electronic pharmacy dispensing data. People were classified as medication users on the date of their first dispensing after cohort entry, which started 90 days after completing cancer treatment, continuing through the earliest of death, health plan disenrollment, or chart abstraction. We collected outcome information from medical record abstraction and tumor registries on colon cancer recurrences and second primary cancers. Using Cox proportional hazards multivariable models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colon cancer recurrences and any cancer event (recurrences and new primaries at any anatomic site) comparing medication users to non-users. Among 2039 people, 937 (46%) used statins and 1425 (70%) used antihypertensives at any point during a median of 4.9 years of follow-up; 460 people had any additional cancer event, including 152 with a colon cancer recurrence. Statin use was not associated with colon cancer recurrence (HR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.65–1.85) or any cancer event (HR = 1.12, 95%CI = 0.85–1.47), nor was antihypertensive use associated with recurrence (HR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.44–1.21) or any cancer event (HR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.70–1.24).

"Combined molecular and clinical approach for decision making for surgery in HNPCC patients: a report on three cases in two families. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is associated with highly penetrant germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. Due to a high lifetime risk in gene carriers for synchronous and for metachronous colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer in women, prophylactic and extended surgery are considered as options for gene carriers. A 54-year-old patient with a history of metachronous rectal cancer and a family history fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria presented with carcinoma of the cecum and highly dysplastic adenomas of the splenic flexure and descending colon. As a result of these findings, medical history and molecular diagnosis, the decision was made to perform colectomy and prophylactic hysterectomy with oophorectomy; histological examination of the specimen showed three synchronous colon carcinomas. The 31-year-old son carrying the pathogenic mutation refused to be included in the HNPCC surveillance program. One year later he presented with symptoms of bowel obstruction, and a carcinoma of the descending colon was diagnosed. Intraoperatively, in addition to the colon cancer, a small bowel cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis were found. In another family fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria without known germline mutation a woman presented with synchronous cancer of the ascending colon and the lower rectum at the age of 49 years. Proctocolectomy and prophylactic hysterectomy were performed, which revealed an additional colon cancer and endometrial cancer. We discuss approaches for individual decision making for surgery in HNPCC patients. Is a subtotal colectomy indicated in the case of first colon cancer in HNPCC patients, or if the first tumor occurs in the lower rectum, should a proctocolectomy or a restorative proctocolectomy be considered? The aim of prospective clinical studies should be to assess acceptability, survival rates, mortality, and the quality of life in HNPCC patients who have undergone surveillance and standard oncological resections versus extended or prophylactic surgery.","combined molecular and clinical approach for decision making for surgery in hnpcc patients: a report on three cases in two families. hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) is associated with highly penetrant germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. due to a high lifetime risk in gene carriers for synchronous and for metachronous colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer in women, prophylactic and extended surgery are considered as options for gene carriers. a 54-year-old patient with a history of metachronous rectal cancer and a family history fulfilling the amsterdam criteria presented with carcinoma of the cecum and highly dysplastic adenomas of the splenic flexure and descending colon. as a result of these findings, medical history and molecular diagnosis, the decision was made to perform colectomy and prophylactic hysterectomy with oophorectomy; histological examination of the specimen showed three synchronous colon carcinomas. the 31-year-old son carrying the pathogenic mutation refused to be included in the",combine molecular approach decision making surgery hnpcc report three two family hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal hnpcc associate highly penetrant germline mutation mismatch repair gene due high lifetime risk gene carrier synchronous metachronous colorectal endometrial woman prophylactic extended surgery consider option gene carrier year old history metachronous rectal family history fulfil amsterdam criterion present carcinoma cecum highly dysplastic adenoma splenic flexure descend colon result finding medical history molecular diagnosis decision make perform colectomy prophylactic hysterectomy oophorectomy histological examination specimen show three synchronous colon carcinoma year old son carry pathogenic mutation refuse include,a,Colon Cancer
"Risk of Advanced Proximal Adenoma and Cancer According to Rectosigmoid Findings in the Korean Population Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the United States and Europe. Recently, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing remarkably in Korea. To reduce the high incidence, screening of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic individuals has been advocated. Sigmoidoscopy is simpler, faster, and better tolerable than total colonoscopy, but the scope cannot reach the proximal colon segment and, therefore, may miss proximal colon cancer. In the present study, we intended to investigate the prevalence of proximal adenoma and cancer according to the findings in rectosigmoid colon and to find their risk factors. Data were collected retrospectively from 1541 consecutive patients who underwent total colonoscopy at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hanyang University, between October 2003 and December 2004. Neoplasms were classified as diminutive adenoma ( or =10 mm, with villous component or high-grade dysplasia), and cancer. The sites of neoplasms were defined as rectosigmoid (rectum and sigmoid colon) and proximal (from cecum to descending colon) colon. The prevalence of advanced proximal adenoma was associated with severe rectosigmoid findings. On the other hand, the prevalence of proximal colon cancer did not show such a tendency. Among the 131 patients with proximal advanced adenoma, 66% had no neoplasm in the rectosigmoid colon. Moreover, among the 27 patients with proximal cancer, 52% had no neoplasm in the rectosigmoid colon. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, gender, and advanced rectosigmoid adenoma were the risk factors of advanced proximal adenoma, but nothing was associated with the risk for proximal colon cancer. Advanced rectosigmoid adenoma may be the predictor of advanced proximal adenoma, especially in old males. However, nothing is related to the risk for proximal colon cancer. Therefore, colonoscopy may be more adequate for colorectal cancer screening than sigmoidoscopy in the Korean population.","risk of advanced proximal adenoma and cancer according to rectosigmoid findings in the korean population colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the united states and europe. recently, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing remarkably in korea. to reduce the high incidence, screening of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic individuals has been advocated. sigmoidoscopy is simpler, faster, and better tolerable than total colonoscopy, but the scope cannot reach the proximal colon segment and, therefore, may miss proximal colon cancer. in the present study, we intended to investigate the prevalence of proximal adenoma and cancer according to the findings in rectosigmoid colon and to find their risk factors. data were collected retrospectively from 1541 consecutive patients who underwent total colonoscopy at the department of gastroenterology, hanyang university, between october 2003 and december 2004. neoplasms were classified as diminutive adenoma ( or =10 mm, with villous",risk advanced proximal adenoma accord rectosigmoid finding korean population colorectal one leading cause death united state europe recently incidence colorectal increase remarkably korea reduce high incidence screening colorectal asymptomatic individual advocate sigmoidoscopy simple faster well tolerable total colonoscopy scope cannot reach proximal colon segment therefore may miss proximal colon present intend investigate prevalence proximal adenoma accord finding rectosigmoid colon find risk factor data collect retrospectively consecutive undergo total colonoscopy department gastroenterology hanyang university october december neoplasm classify diminutive adenoma mm villous,a,Colon Cancer

"Mesorectal fat area as a useful predictor of the difficulty of robotic-assisted laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer Various predictors of the difficulty of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer have been described. Although a bulky mesorectum was considered to pose technical difficulties in total mesorectal excision, no studies have evaluated the influence of mesorectum morphology on the difficulty of total mesorectal excision. Mesorectal fat area at the level of the tip of the ischial spines on magnetic resonance imaging was described as a parameter characterizing mesorectum morphology. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of clinical and anatomical factors, including mesorectal fat area, on the difficulty of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This study enrolled 98 patients who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision for primary rectal cancer, performed by a single expert surgeon, between 2010 and 2015. Magnetic resonance imaging-based pelvimetry data were collected. Linear regression was performed to determine clinical and anatomical factors significantly associated with operative time of the pelvic phase, which was defined as the time interval from the start of rectal mobilization to the division of the rectum. The median operative time of the pelvic phase was 68 min (range 33–178 min). On univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with longer operative time of the pelvic phase: male sex, larger tumor size, larger visceral fat area, larger mesorectal fat area, shorter pelvic outlet length, longer sacral length, shorter interspinous distance, larger pelvic inlet angle, and smaller angle between the lines connecting the coccyx to S3 and to the inferior middle aspect of the pubic symphysis. On multiple linear regression analysis, only larger mesorectal fat area remained significantly associated with longer operative time of the pelvic phase (p = 0.009).

"Kisspeptin Effect on Endothelial Monocyte Activating Polypeptide II (EMAP-II)-Associated Lymphocyte Cell Death and Metastases in Colorectal Cancer Patients Kisspeptin is an antimetastatic agent in some cancers that has also been associated with lymphoid cell apoptosis, a phenomenon favoring metastases. Our aim was to determine the association of kisspeptin with lymphocyte apoptosis and the presence of metastases in colorectal cancer patients. Blood was drawn from 69 colon cancer patients and 20 healthy volunteers. Tissue specimens from healthy and pathological tissue were immunohistochemically analyzed for kisspeptin and endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II) expression. Blood EMAP-II and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) levels were examined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The kisspeptin and EMAP-II expression and secretion levels in the DLD-1 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas lymphocyte viability was assessed by flow cytometry. The effect of kisspeptin on the viability of colon cancer cells was examined by MTT [3-(4),5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]. Exogenous, synthetic and naturally produced, kisspeptin induces through the G-protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54; also known as the kisspeptin receptor) the EMAP-II expression and secretion in colon cancer cell lines, inducing in vitro lymphocyte apoptosis, as verified by the use of an anti-EMAP-II antibody. These results were reversed with the use of kisspeptin inhibitors and by kisspeptin-silencing experiments. Tumor kisspeptin expression was associated with the tumor EMAP-II expression (p < 0.001). Elevated kisspeptin and EMAP-II expression in colon cancer tissues was associated with lack of metastases (p < 0.001) in colon cancer patients. These data indicate the antimetastatic effect of tumor-elevated kisspeptin in colon cancer patients that may be mediated by the effect of kisspeptin on EMAP-II expression in colon cancer tumors in patients with normal serum EMAP-II levels. These findings provide new insight into the role of kisspeptin in the context of metastases in colon cancer patients.","kisspeptin effect on endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide ii (emap-ii)-associated lymphocyte cell death and metastases in colorectal cancer patients kisspeptin is an antimetastatic agent in some cancers that has also been associated with lymphoid cell apoptosis, a phenomenon favoring metastases. our aim was to determine the association of kisspeptin with lymphocyte apoptosis and the presence of metastases in colorectal cancer patients. blood was drawn from 69 colon cancer patients and 20 healthy volunteers. tissue specimens from healthy and pathological tissue were immunohistochemically analyzed for kisspeptin and endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide ii (emap-ii) expression. blood emap-ii and soluble fas ligand (sfasl) levels were examined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. the kisspeptin and emap-ii expression and secretion levels in the dld-1 and ht-29 colon cancer cell lines were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas lymphocyte viability was assessed by flow cytometry. the effect of",kisspeptin effect endothelial monocyte activate polypeptide ii emap ii associate lymphocyte cell death metastasis colorectal kisspeptin antimetastatic agent also associate lymphoid cell apoptosis phenomenon favoring metastases determine association kisspeptin lymphocyte apoptosis presence metastasis colorectal blood draw colon healthy volunteer tissue specimen healthy pathological tissue immunohistochemically analyze kisspeptin endothelial monocyte activate polypeptide ii emap ii expression blood emap ii soluble fa ligand sfasl level examine enzyme link immunosorbent assay method kisspeptin emap ii expression secretion level dld ht colon cell line examine quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction western enzyme link immunosorbent assay whereas lymphocyte viability assess flow cytometry effect,a,Colon Cancer

The CXCL14 was selected for further analysis for its most significant P value. Single-cell analysis showed that the CXCL14 was mainly expressed in the fibroblasts. Meanwhile, the biological role of fibroblasts in the colon cancer microenvironment was investigated. Further, the clinical role of CXCL14 in colon cancer was also explored. The result showed that the CXCL14 is a protective factor against colon cancer independent of other clinical parameters like age, gender, clinical stage, and TNM classifications. Then, biological enrichment analysis indicated that the CXCL14 is predominantly involved in the activating of the WNT/β/catenin pathway, pancreas beta cells, peroxisome and bile acid metabolism. Immune infiltration analysis showed that for the patients with high CXCL14 levels, the plasma B cells, CD8 + T cells, neutrophil and NK cells might infiltrate more, in contrast to B cells, monocyte and macrophages.

"Types and amount of dietary fat and colon cancer risk: Prevention by omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in the Western world including the United Sates. In recent years there is a strong upward trend in colon cancer risk in Japan mainly due to Americanization of Japanese food habits. Several epidemiological studies point to a strong association between nutrient composition of the diet and cancer of the colon. The role of types of dietary fat, especially saturated fats of animal origin, n−6- and n−3-rich polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the etiology of colorectal cancer has become increasingly apparent. Epidemiological studies indicate a positive association between the dietary intake of saturated fat and/or animal fat and colon cancer risk and an inverse relationship between the intake of fish and fish oil rich in n−3 PUFAs and colon cancer development. Although the evidence from case-control studies and international correlational studies is not totally consistent, these inconsistencies may have arisen, at least in part, from methodological limitations. Animal, model studies have unequivocally provided evidence that the colon tumor-promoting effect of dietary fat depends on its fatty acid composition and that high dietary n−3 PUFAs lacks colon tumor-promoting effect, as compared to diets high in n−6 PUFAs or saturated fats. Diets rich in n−3 PUFAs inhibit colon carcinogenesis through the modulation of colonicras-p21, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities and apoptosis. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays indicates that n−3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid activates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21, p27, p57 and p19 and inactivates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of genes, and prostagland in family of genes. These results suggest that decreasing the intake of n−6 PUFAs and saturated fats and increasing that of n−3 PUFAs, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid has the potential to be a major component of colon cancer control.","types and amount of dietary fat and colon cancer risk: prevention by omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in the western world including the united sates. in recent years there is a strong upward trend in colon cancer risk in japan mainly due to americanization of japanese food habits. several epidemiological studies point to a strong association between nutrient composition of the diet and cancer of the colon. the role of types of dietary fat, especially saturated fats of animal origin, n−6- and n−3-rich polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) in the etiology of colorectal cancer has become increasingly apparent. epidemiological studies indicate a positive association between the dietary intake of saturated fat and/or animal fat and colon cancer risk and an inverse relationship between the intake of fish and fish oil rich in n−3 pufas and colon cancer development. although the evidence from case-control studies",type amount dietary fat colon risk prevention omega fatty acid rich diet colorectal second common malignancy western world include united sates recent year strong upward trend colon risk japan mainly due americanization japanese food habit several epidemiological point strong association nutrient composition diet colon role type dietary fat especially saturate fat animal origin n n rich polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas etiology colorectal become increasingly apparent epidemiological indicate positive association dietary intake saturated fat animal fat colon risk inverse relationship intake fish fish oil rich n pufas colon development although evidence control,a,Colon Cancer
"Linc00659, a long noncoding RNA, acts as novel oncogene in regulating cancer cell growth in colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers and causes of cancer-related death worldwide. In patients with CRC, metastasis is a crucial problem that leads to treatment failure and is the primary cause of the lethality of colon cancer. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as critical molecules in the development, cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis of CRC. We investigated the transcriptome profiles of human lncRNAs in the primary tumor tissues and in the corresponding normal mucosa of two patients with CRC by using a microarray approach. The expression levels of lncRNAs were verified in colon cancer by real-time PCR. Using bioinformatics approach to illustrate putative biological function of Linc00659 in colon cancer. The effects of Linc00659 on cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were studies by in vitro assays. Our data revealed that compared with adjacent normal tissues, 201 lncRNAs were deregulated (fold change ≥ 4 or ≤ 0.25) in CRC tissues. Among them, the expression levels of Linc00659 were significantly increased in colon cancer, and high expression levels were correlated with poor survival in patients with CRC. Bioinformatics analysis results indicated that Linc00659 was significantly coexpressed with cycle-related genes in CRC. Linc00659 expression knockdown could significantly suppress colon cancer cell growth by impairing cell cycle progression. In addition, our results showed that Linc00659 expression knockdown could accelerate cell apoptosis in colon cancer cells treated with chemotherapy drugs. Meanwhile, our results also demonstrated that silencing of Linc00659 expression leads to cell growth inhibition and induced apoptosis, possibly by suppressing PI3K-AKT signaling in colon cancer. Linc00659 is a novel oncogenic lncRNA involved in colon cancer cell growth by modulating the cell cycle. Our findings give an insight into lncRNA regulation and provide an application for colon cancer therapy.","linc00659, a long noncoding rna, acts as novel oncogene in regulating cancer cell growth in colorectal cancer. colorectal cancer (crc) is one of the most common cancers and causes of cancer-related death worldwide. in patients with crc, metastasis is a crucial problem that leads to treatment failure and is the primary cause of the lethality of colon cancer. long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) have recently emerged as critical molecules in the development, cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis of crc. we investigated the transcriptome profiles of human lncrnas in the primary tumor tissues and in the corresponding normal mucosa of two patients with crc by using a microarray approach. the expression levels of lncrnas were verified in colon cancer by real-time pcr. using bioinformatics approach to illustrate putative biological function of linc00659 in colon cancer. the effects of linc00659 on cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were studies by in vitro",linc long noncoding rna act novel oncogene regulate cell growth colorectal colorectal crc one common cause relate death worldwide crc metastasis crucial problem lead failure primary cause lethality colon long noncoding rna lncrnas recently emerge critical molecule development cell growth apoptosis metastasis crc investigate transcriptome profile human lncrnas primary tissue corresponding normal mucosa two crc use microarray approach expression level lncrnas verify colon real time pcr use bioinformatics approach illustrate putative biological function linc colon effect linc cell growth proliferation cell cycle apoptosis vitro,a,Colon Cancer
"Co-expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic HMGB1 is inversely associated with infiltration of CD45RO+ T cells and prognosis in patients with stage IIIB colon cancer. Background: The intratumoral infiltration of T cells, especially memory T cells, is associated with a favorable prognosis in early colorectal cancers. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. This study examined whether high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule, is involved in the infiltration of T cells and disease progression in locally advanced colon cancer. Methods: Seventy-two cases of pathologically-confirmed specimens were obtained from patients with stage IIIB (T3N1M0) colon cancer who underwent radical resection between January 1999 and May 2002 at the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen University. The density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the tumor tissue and the expression of HMGB1 in the cancer cells were examined via immunohistochemical analysis. The phenotype of CD45RO+ cells was confirmed using a flow cytometric assay. The association between HMGB1 expression, the density of TILs, and the 5-year survival rate were analyzed. Results: The density of CD45RO+ T cells within the tumor was independently prognostic, although a higher density of CD3+ T cells was also associated with a favorable prognosis. More importantly, the expression of HMGB1 was observed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (co-expression pattern) in a subset of colon cancer tissues, whereas nuclear-only expression of HMGB1 (nuclear expression pattern) existed in most of the cancer tissues and normal mucosa. The co-expression pattern of HMGB1 in colon cancer cells was inversely associated with the infiltration of both CD3+ and CD45RO+ T cells and 5-year survival rates. Conclusions: This study revealed that the co-expression of HMGB1 is inversely associated with the infiltration of CD45RO+ T cells and prognosis in patients with stage IIIB colon cancer, indicating that the distribution patterns of HMGB1 might contribute to the progression of colon cancer via modulation of the local immune response.","co-expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic hmgb1 is inversely associated with infiltration of cd45ro+ t cells and prognosis in patients with stage iiib colon cancer. background: the intratumoral infiltration of t cells, especially memory t cells, is associated with a favorable prognosis in early colorectal cancers. however, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. this study examined whether high-mobility group box 1 (hmgb1), a damage-associated molecular pattern (damp) molecule, is involved in the infiltration of t cells and disease progression in locally advanced colon cancer. methods: seventy-two cases of pathologically-confirmed specimens were obtained from patients with stage iiib (t3n1m0) colon cancer who underwent radical resection between january 1999 and may 2002 at the cancer center of sun yat-sen university. the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils) within the tumor tissue and the expression of hmgb1 in the cancer cells were examined via immunohistochemical analysis. the phenotype of cd45ro+ cells was confirmed using",co expression nuclear cytoplasmic hmgb inversely associate infiltration cd ro cell prognosis stage iiib colon intratumoral infiltration cell especially memory cell associate favorable prognosis early colorectal however mechanism underlie process remain elusive examine whether high mobility group box hmgb damage associate molecular pattern damp molecule involve infiltration cell progression locally advanced colon method seventy two pathologically confirm specimen obtain stage iiib n colon undergo radical resection january may center sun yat sen university density infiltrate lymphocyte tils within tissue expression hmgb cell examine via immunohistochemical phenotype cd ro cell confirm use,a,Colon Cancer
"Reduced colon cancer incidence and mortality in postmenopausal women treated with an oral bisphosphonate--Danish National Register Based Cohort Study. In this Danish national register-based cohort study, we examined the effects of alendronate on the development of colon cancers and survival. The incidence of colon cancer and mortality rate, once colon cancer had been diagnosed, were lower in patients treated with alendronate, posing the question whether alendronate acts as chemopreventive. When bisphosphonates are given by mouth, around 99% remains non-absorbed in the intestine. Based on their biochemical actions, we predicted that oral bisphosphonates might prevent colon cancers. This is a Danish national register-based cohort study. We identified 30,606 women aged 50+, mean age 71.9 years, who had not previously taken treatments for osteoporosis, who began to take alendronate in 1996–2005, and assigned 124,424 individually age- and gender-matched control subjects. The main outcome measure was colorectal cancers incidence and post-diagnosis survival in patients taking oral alendronate for osteoporosis. Cox proportional hazards analysis of death due to colon cancer showed lower risk in alendronate users, crude hazard ratio (HR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.59–0.81) with an adjusted HR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52–0.72). The reduction in risk comprised both a lower incidence of colon cancer-adjusted HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.60–0.79) and a lower mortality once colon cancer had been diagnosed, adjusted HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70–0.97). Weekly alendronate was associated with a greater risk reduction than daily alendronate. The main findings were unaffected by excluding patients from the analysis who had pulmonary disease, a major co-morbid condition in users of alendronate and an important cause of death. The risk of overall deaths from cancer and in particular death caused by colon cancer was significantly and substantially decreased (40%) in patients treated with alendronate, with survival curves deviating progressively after 2 years. Also, the incidence of colon cancer was lower in those patients.","reduced colon cancer incidence and mortality in postmenopausal women treated with an oral bisphosphonate--danish national register based cohort study. in this danish national register-based cohort study, we examined the effects of alendronate on the development of colon cancers and survival. the incidence of colon cancer and mortality rate, once colon cancer had been diagnosed, were lower in patients treated with alendronate, posing the question whether alendronate acts as chemopreventive. when bisphosphonates are given by mouth, around 99% remains non-absorbed in the intestine. based on their biochemical actions, we predicted that oral bisphosphonates might prevent colon cancers. this is a danish national register-based cohort study. we identified 30,606 women aged 50+, mean age 71.9 years, who had not previously taken treatments for osteoporosis, who began to take alendronate in 1996–2005, and assigned 124,424 individually age- and gender-matched control subjects. the main outcome measure was colorectal cancers incidence and post-diagnosis survival in",reduce colon incidence mortality postmenopausal woman treat oral bisphosphonate danish national register base cohort danish national register base cohort examine effect alendronate development colon survival incidence colon mortality rate colon diagnose low treat alendronate pose question whether alendronate act chemopreventive bisphosphonates give mouth around remain non absorb intestine base biochemical action predict oral bisphosphonates might prevent colon danish national register base cohort identify woman age mean age year previously take osteoporosis begin take alendronate assign individually age gender match control subject main outcome measure colorectal incidence post diagnosis survival,a,Colon Cancer

"P4HA3 promotes colon cancer cell escape from macrophage phagocytosis by increasing phagocytosis immune checkpoint CD47 expression. Cancer immunotherapies have greatly changed the prospects for the therapy of many malignancies, including colon cancer. Macrophages as the effectors of cancer immunotherapy provide considerable promise for cancer treatment. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 3 (P4HA3) plays a cancer-promoting role in a variety of cancers, including colon cancer. In the present work, we provided evidence for the first time that P4HA3 promoted colon cancer cell escape from macrophage phagocytosis, and preliminarily explored its possible molecular mechanism. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of P4HA3 in tissues. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the tumor public databases (including TCGA database and GEO database). Macrophage phagocytosis assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of related markers (such as P4HA3, CD47, CD24, IL-34, and M-CSF). First, we found that P4HA3 was significantly and highly expressed in both colon cancer tissues and cells, and that P4HA3 had a positive correlation with lymph node metastasis, Dukes stage and also strongly correlated with poorer survival. Subsequently, we found that P4HA3 was strongly associated with the macrophage infiltration level in colon cancer. Immediately we also found that decreasing P4HA3 expression promoted macrophage phagocytosis in colon cancer cells, whereas P4HA3 overexpression produced the opposite effect. Finally, we demonstrated that P4HA3 promoted the expression of cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) in colon cancer cells. Moreover, P4HA3 caused colon cancer cells to secrete Interleukin 34 (IL34) and Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which further induced macrophages to differentiate to M2 type and thereby contributed to the progression of colon cancer. We have demonstrated that P4HA3-driven CD47 overexpression may act as an escape mechanism, causing colon cancer cells to evade phagocytosis from macrophages.","p4ha3 promotes colon cancer cell escape from macrophage phagocytosis by increasing phagocytosis immune checkpoint cd47 expression. cancer immunotherapies have greatly changed the prospects for the therapy of many malignancies, including colon cancer. macrophages as the effectors of cancer immunotherapy provide considerable promise for cancer treatment. prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 3 (p4ha3) plays a cancer-promoting role in a variety of cancers, including colon cancer. in the present work, we provided evidence for the first time that p4ha3 promoted colon cancer cell escape from macrophage phagocytosis, and preliminarily explored its possible molecular mechanism. immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of p4ha3 in tissues. bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the tumor public databases (including tcga database and geo database). macrophage phagocytosis assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. western blot and qrt-pcr were used to detect the expression of related markers (such as p4ha3,",p ha promote colon cell escape macrophage phagocytosis increase phagocytosis immune checkpoint cd expression immunotherapy greatly change prospect therapy many malignancy include colon macrophages effector immunotherapy provide considerable promise prolyl hydroxylase subunit alpha p ha play promote role variety include colon present work provide evidence first time p ha promote colon cell escape macrophage phagocytosis preliminarily explore possible molecular mechanism immunohistochemistry use detect expression p ha tissue bioinformatics method use analyze public databases include tcga database geo database macrophage phagocytosis assay flow cytometric use detect phagocytic capacity macrophage western blot qrt pcr use detect expression related marker p ha,a,Colon Cancer
"Randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of adjuvant immunochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, using different combinations of the intracutaneous streptococcal preparation OK-432 and the oral pyrimidines 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil and uracil/tegafur. We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, using different combinations of the intracutaneous streptococcal preparation OK-432 and the oral pyrimidines 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (carmofur, HCFU) and uracil/tegafur (UFT). Patients with stage II, III, or IV (Dukes’ B, C) colorectal cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of three groups: an immunochemotherapy group (mitomycin C [MMC] + 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] + HCFU + OK-432), a chemotherapy group (MMC + 5-FU + HCFU), and a control group (surgery alone) for those with colon cancer (study 1); and an immunochemotherapy group (MMC + 5-FU + UFT + OK-432), a chemotherapy group (MMC + 5-FU + UFT), and a control group (surgery alone) for those with rectal cancer (study 2). A total of 760 patients with colon cancer and 669 patients with rectal cancer were entered into this randomized clinical trial (RCT). The incidence of side-effects was in the order of: immunochemotherapy group ≫ chemotherapy group ≫ control group in both the cohort of patients with colon cancer and the cohort with rectal cancer. In particular, the frequency of leucopenia and skin disorders was significantly higher than control groups. There were no severe adverse events such as death related to the adjuvant therapy. In both the colon cancer and rectal cancer cohorts, no significant difference in the 5-year survival rate and disease-free survival rate was noted among the three groups. The results of an RCT demonstrated that the combination of MMC + 5-FU + HCFU + OK-432 for colon cancer and that of MMC + 5-FU + UFT + OK-432 for rectal cancer could not prolong the survival of patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer, but that both combinations were well tolerated as adjuvant therapy.","randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of adjuvant immunochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, using different combinations of the intracutaneous streptococcal preparation ok-432 and the oral pyrimidines 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil and uracil/tegafur. we investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, using different combinations of the intracutaneous streptococcal preparation ok-432 and the oral pyrimidines 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (carmofur, hcfu) and uracil/tegafur (uft). patients with stage ii, iii, or iv (dukes’ b, c) colorectal cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of three groups: an immunochemotherapy group (mitomycin c [mmc] + 5-fluorouracil [5-fu] + hcfu + ok-432), a chemotherapy group (mmc + 5-fu + hcfu), and a control group (surgery alone) for those with colon cancer (study 1); and an immunochemotherapy group (mmc + 5-fu + uft + ok-432), a chemotherapy group (mmc + 5-fu + uft), and a control group (surgery alone) for those with rectal",randomize controlled trial efficacy adjuvant immunochemotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy colorectal use different combination intracutaneous streptococcal preparation ok oral pyrimidine hexylcarbamoyl fluorouracil uracil tegafur investigate efficacy safety adjuvant immunochemotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy colorectal use different combination intracutaneous streptococcal preparation ok oral pyrimidine hexylcarbamoyl fluorouracil carmofur hcfu uracil tegafur uft stage ii iii iv duke b c colorectal enrol randomly assign one three group immunochemotherapy group mitomycin c mmc fluorouracil fu hcfu ok chemotherapy group mmc fu hcfu control group surgery alone colon immunochemotherapy group mmc fu uft ok chemotherapy group mmc fu uft control group surgery alone rectal,a,Colon Cancer
"Spontaneous regression of advanced transverse colon cancer with remaining lymph node metastasis. The observation of spontaneous regression (SR) has been well documented for many cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and malignant melanoma. However, the SR frequency in colorectal cancer is very rare. Therefore, the accumulation of SR colorectal cancer cases might contribute to find the regression mechanism. A 67-year-old woman received colonoscopy due to being positive for fecal occult blood testing and was diagnosed as having a transverse colon cancer at a local hospital. She was admitted to our institution for surgical treatment of the colon cancer. The colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor of 13 mm in diameter at the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. The enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an enlarged lymph node in the intermediate lymph node region. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT showed no abnormal accumulation on the transverse colon; however, an abnormal accumulation was found at the enlarged lymph node. The patient was preoperatively diagnosed as having advanced transverse colon cancer with lymph node metastasis and underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection.

"Contribution of extended family history in assessment of risk for breast and colon cancer Family history is important for identifying candidates for high risk cancer screening and referral for genetic counseling. We sought to determine the percentage of individuals who would be eligible for high risk cancer screening or genetic referral and testing if family history includes an extended (vs limited) family history. Family histories were obtained from 626 women at UVMMC associated mammography centers from 2001 to 2002. ACS guidelines were used to determine eligibility for high risk breast or colon cancer screening. Eligibility for referral for genetic counseling for hereditary breast and colon cancer was determined using the Referral Screening Tool and Amsterdam II screening criteria, respectively. All family histories were assessed for eligibility by a limited history (first degree relatives only) and extended history (first and second degree relatives). Four hundred ninety-nine histories were eligible for review. 18/282 (3.6 %) and 62/123 (12 %) individuals met criteria for high risk breast and colon cancer screening, respectively. 13/18 (72 %) in the high risk breast cancer screening group and 12/62 (19 %) in the high risk colon cancer screening group met criteria based upon an extended family history. 9/282 (1.8 %) and 31/123 (6.2 %) individuals met criteria for genetic counseling referral and testing for breast and colon cancer, respectively. 2/9 (22 %) of individuals in the genetic breast cancer screening group and 21/31 (68 %) individuals in the genetic colon cancer screening group met criteria based upon extended family history.

"Comprehensive analyses of correlation and survival reveal informative lncRNA prognostic signatures in colon cancer Colon cancer is a commonly worldwide cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes and are closely related to the occurrence of colon cancer. Identification of the prognostic signatures of lncRNAs in colon cancer has great significance for its treatment. We first identified the colon cancer-related mRNAs and lncRNAs according to the differential analysis methods using the expression data in TCGA. Then, we performed correlation analysis between the identified mRNAs and lncRNAs by integrating their expression values and secondary structure information to estimate the co-regulatory relationships between the cancer-related mRNAs and lncRNAs. Besides, the competing endogenous RNA regulation network based on co-regulatory relationships was constructed to reveal cancer-related regulatory patterns. Meanwhile, we used traditional regression analysis (univariate Cox analysis, random survival forest analysis, and lasso regression analysis) to screen the cancer-related lncRNAs. Finally, by combining the identified colon cancer-related lncRNAs according to the above analyses, we constructed a risk prognosis model for colon cancer through multivariate Cox analysis and also validated the model in the colon cancer dataset in TCGA cohorts. Six lncRNAs were found highly correlated with the overall survival of colon cancer patients, and a risk prognosis model based on them was constructed to predict the overall survival of colon cancer patients. In particular, EVX1-AS, ZNF667-AS1, CTC-428G20.6, and CTC-297N7.9 were first reported to be related to colon cancer by using our model, among which EVX1-AS and ZNF667-AS1 have been predicted to be related to colon cancer in LncRNADisease database. This study identified the potential regulatory relationships between lncRNAs and mRNAs by integrating their expression values and secondary structure information and presented a significant 6-lncRNA risk prognosis model to predict the overall survival of colon cancer patients.","comprehensive analyses of correlation and survival reveal informative lncrna prognostic signatures in colon cancer colon cancer is a commonly worldwide cancer with high morbidity and mortality. long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are involved in many biological processes and are closely related to the occurrence of colon cancer. identification of the prognostic signatures of lncrnas in colon cancer has great significance for its treatment. we first identified the colon cancer-related mrnas and lncrnas according to the differential analysis methods using the expression data in tcga. then, we performed correlation analysis between the identified mrnas and lncrnas by integrating their expression values and secondary structure information to estimate the co-regulatory relationships between the cancer-related mrnas and lncrnas. besides, the competing endogenous rna regulation network based on co-regulatory relationships was constructed to reveal cancer-related regulatory patterns. meanwhile, we used traditional regression analysis (univariate cox analysis, random survival forest analysis, and lasso regression analysis) to",comprehensive correlation survival reveal informative lncrna prognostic signature colon colon commonly worldwide high morbidity mortality long non cod rna lncrnas involve many biological process closely relate occurrence colon identification prognostic signature lncrnas colon great significance first identify colon relate mrna lncrnas accord differential method use expression data tcga perform correlation identify mrna lncrnas integrate expression value secondary structure information estimate co regulatory relationship relate mrna lncrnas besides compete endogenous rna regulation network base co regulatory relationship construct reveal relate regulatory pattern meanwhile use traditional regression univariate cox random survival forest lasso regression,a,Colon Cancer
"Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon. Persistent descending mesocolon (PDM) is caused by the absence of fusion of the descending colon to the retroperitoneum. We herein report two colorectal cancer cases with PDM that were treated with laparoscopic surgery. Case 1: a 50-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with lymph node dissection cutting the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and synchronous liver resection. He experienced postoperative stenosis of the reconstructed colon possibly due to an impaired arterial blood flow in the reconstructed colon. Case 2: a 77-year-old man with rectal cancer. Laparoscopic low anterior resection preserving the left colic artery (LCA) was performed. Intraoperative infrared ray (IR) imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) showed good blood flow of the reconstructed colon. He had no postoperative complications. In cases of PDM, the mesentery of the descending and sigmoid colon containing the LCA is often shortened, and the marginal artery of the reconstructed colon is located close to the root of the LCA. Lymph node dissection accompanied by cutting the LCA carries a risk of marginal artery injury. Therefore, we recommend lymph node dissection preserving the LCA in colorectal cancer patients with PDM in order to maintain the blood flow of the reconstructed colon. If the IMA and LCA absolutely need to be cut for complete lymph node dissection, the marginal artery should be clearly identified and preserved. In addition, intraoperative IR imaging is extremely useful for evaluating colonic perfusion and reducing the risk of anastomotic complications. In colorectal cancer surgery in patients with PDM, surgeons should be aware of these tips for maintaining the blood flow of the reconstructed colon and thereby avoid postoperative complications caused by an impaired blood flow.","laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon. persistent descending mesocolon (pdm) is caused by the absence of fusion of the descending colon to the retroperitoneum. we herein report two colorectal cancer cases with pdm that were treated with laparoscopic surgery. case 1: a 50-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis. after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with lymph node dissection cutting the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (ima) and synchronous liver resection. he experienced postoperative stenosis of the reconstructed colon possibly due to an impaired arterial blood flow in the reconstructed colon. case 2: a 77-year-old man with rectal cancer. laparoscopic low anterior resection preserving the left colic artery (lca) was performed. intraoperative infrared ray (ir) imaging using indocyanine green (icg) showed good blood flow of the reconstructed colon. he had no postoperative complications. in cases of pdm, the mesentery of the descending",laparoscopic surgery colorectal persistent descend mesocolon persistent descend mesocolon pdm cause absence fusion descend colon retroperitoneum herein report two colorectal pdm treat laparoscopic surgery year old man sigmoid colon synchronous liver metastasis neoadjuvant chemotherapy underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy lymph node dissection cut root inferior mesenteric artery ima synchronous liver resection experience postoperative stenosis reconstructed colon possibly due impaired arterial blood flow reconstructed colon year old man rectal laparoscopic low anterior resection preserve left colic artery lca perform intraoperative infrared ray ir image use indocyanine green icg show good blood flow reconstructed colon postoperative complication pdm mesentery descending,a,Colon Cancer

"NF-κB maintains the stemness of colon cancer cells by downregulating miR-195-5p/497-5p and upregulating MCM2. Colon cancer represents one of the leading causes of gastrointestinal tumors in industrialized countries, and its incidence appears to be increasing at an alarming rate. Accumulating evidence has unveiled the contributory roles of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumorigenicity, recurrence, and metastases. The functions of NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation on cancer cell survival, including colon cancer cells have encouraged us to study the role of NF-κB in the maintenance of CSCs in colon cancer. Tumor samples and matched normal samples were obtained from 35 colon cancer cases. CSCs were isolated from human colon cancer cell lines, where the stemness of the cells was evaluated by cell viability, colony-forming, spheroid-forming, invasion, migration, and apoptosis assays. NF-κB activation was then performed in subcutaneous tumor models of CSCs by injecting lipopolysaccharides (LPS) i.p. We found that NF-κB activation could reduce the expression of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p, where these two miRNAs were determined to be downregulated in colon cancer tissues, cultured colon CSCs, and LPS-injected subcutaneous tumor models. Elevation of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p levels by their specific mimic could ablate the effects of NF-κB on the stemness of colon cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that NF-κB could maintain the stemness of colon cancer cells by downregulating miR-195-5p/497–5p. MCM2 was validated as the target gene of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p in cultured colon CSCs. Overexpression of MCM2 was shown to restore the stemness of colon cancer cells in the presence of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p, suggesting that miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p could impair the stemness of colon cancer cells by targeting MCM2 in vivo and in vitro. Our work demonstrates that the restoration of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p may be a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment in relation to NF-κB activation.","nf-κb maintains the stemness of colon cancer cells by downregulating mir-195-5p/497-5p and upregulating mcm2. colon cancer represents one of the leading causes of gastrointestinal tumors in industrialized countries, and its incidence appears to be increasing at an alarming rate. accumulating evidence has unveiled the contributory roles of cancer stem cells (cscs) in tumorigenicity, recurrence, and metastases. the functions of nf-kappa b (nf-κb) activation on cancer cell survival, including colon cancer cells have encouraged us to study the role of nf-κb in the maintenance of cscs in colon cancer. tumor samples and matched normal samples were obtained from 35 colon cancer cases. cscs were isolated from human colon cancer cell lines, where the stemness of the cells was evaluated by cell viability, colony-forming, spheroid-forming, invasion, migration, and apoptosis assays. nf-κb activation was then performed in subcutaneous tumor models of cscs by injecting lipopolysaccharides (lps) i.p. we found that nf-κb activation could",nf b maintain stemness colon cell downregulating mir p p upregulating mcm colon represent one leading cause gastrointestinal industrialized country incidence appear increase alarm rate accumulate evidence unveil contributory role stem cell cscs tumorigenicity recurrence metastases function nf kappa b nf b activation cell survival include colon cell encourage u role nf b maintenance cscs colon sample match normal sample obtain colon cscs isolate human colon cell line stemness cell evaluate cell viability colony form spheroid form invasion migration apoptosis assay nf b activation perform subcutaneous model cscs inject lipopolysaccharides lps p find nf b activation could,a,Colon Cancer

"DACT2 is a functional tumor suppressor through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated with poor survival in colon cancer. Dapper homolog (DACT) 2 is one of the Dact gene family members, which are important modulators of Wnt signaling pathway. We aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in colon cancer. DACT2 was silenced in five out of eight colon cancer cell lines, but robustly expressed in normal colon tissues. The loss of DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. Restoring DACT2 expression in colon cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, DACT2 overexpression effectively reduced lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. These effects by DACT2 were attributed to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Reexpression of DACT2 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of both wild-type β-catenin and degradation-resistant form mutant β-catenin (S33Y). DACT2 could actively shuttle into and out of nuclei, with its predominant steady-state localization in the cytoplasm dependent on its nuclear export signal. Co-immunoprecipitation results indicated that DACT2 strongly associated β-catenin as well as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and directly disrupted the formation of the β-catenin–LEF1 complex in the nucleus. Whereas in the cytoplasm, DACT2 restored junctional localization of E-cadherin–β-catenin complexes and prevented β-catenin nuclear translocation through direct interaction with β-catenin. DACT2 methylation was detected in 43.3% (29/67) of colon cancer tissues, but none in normal controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with DACT2 methylation had a significant decrease in overall survival (P=0.006). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that DACT2 methylation was significantly associated with shortened survival in stage I–III colon cancer patients. In conclusion, DACT2 acts as a functional tumor suppressor in colon cancer through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Its methylation at early stages of colon carcinogenesis is an independent prognostic factor.","dact2 is a functional tumor suppressor through inhibiting wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated with poor survival in colon cancer. dapper homolog (dact) 2 is one of the dact gene family members, which are important modulators of wnt signaling pathway. we aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in colon cancer. dact2 was silenced in five out of eight colon cancer cell lines, but robustly expressed in normal colon tissues. the loss of dact2 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. restoring dact2 expression in colon cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. moreover, dact2 overexpression effectively reduced lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. these effects by dact2 were attributed to inhibition of wnt/β-catenin signaling. reexpression of dact2 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of both wild-type β-catenin and degradation-resistant form mutant β-catenin",dact functional suppressor inhibit wnt catenin pathway associate poor survival colon dapper homolog dact one dact gene family member important modulators wnt signal pathway clarify epigenetic inactivation biological function implication colon dact silence five eight colon cell line robustly express normal colon tissue loss dact expression regulate promoter hypermethylation restore dact expression colon cell line suppress cell growth induce cell apoptosis inhibit cell proliferation vitro vivo moreover dact overexpression effectively reduce lung metastasis colon cell nude mouse effect dact attribute inhibition wnt catenin signal reexpression dact significantly suppress transcriptional activity wild type catenin degradation resistant form mutant catenin,a,Colon Cancer
"Reproductive factors and colon cancers. In Los Angeles County, the age-adjusted incidence rate of colon cancer in men is almost 30% higher than that in women; however, in the descending and sigmoid colon, age-specific incidence rates for women are higher than those for men before age 55. Since menstrual and/or reproductive factors may be involved in producing this crossover in age-specific rates, they were examined in a population-based case-control study involving 327 white women with adenocarcinoma of the colon and age-, race- and neighbourhood-matched controls. After adjustment for other factors associated with colon cancer in this study (family history of large bowel cancer, total fat intake, calcium, weight and activity level), ever having been pregnant was protective (RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.33-0.97). For one to two pregnancies, the RR was 0.76 (CI = 0.42-1.37); for three or more pregnancies, the RR was 0.45 (CI = 0.25-0.81). However, the relationship between the number of pregnancies and colon cancer risk was actually U-shaped, with risk decreasing with successive pregnancies up to four and then increasing with additional pregnancies. The U-shaped relationship was present for incomplete as well as for full-term pregnancies and was more striking for cancers occurring in the distal (descending and sigmoid) than proximal (caecum to splenic flexure) colon. Risk was not related to age at menarche or use of exogenous oestrogens, but delayed natural menopause was weakly protective in the proximal but not distal colon. The crossover in incidence rates in the distal colon can be completely accounted for by the pregnancy effect. The U-shape of the pregnancy curve suggests the possibility of competing factors, some protective, especially after one or several pregnancies, and others conferring increasing risk with successive pregnancies, regardless of the pregnancy outcome.","reproductive factors and colon cancers. in los angeles county, the age-adjusted incidence rate of colon cancer in men is almost 30% higher than that in women; however, in the descending and sigmoid colon, age-specific incidence rates for women are higher than those for men before age 55. since menstrual and/or reproductive factors may be involved in producing this crossover in age-specific rates, they were examined in a population-based case-control study involving 327 white women with adenocarcinoma of the colon and age-, race- and neighbourhood-matched controls. after adjustment for other factors associated with colon cancer in this study (family history of large bowel cancer, total fat intake, calcium, weight and activity level), ever having been pregnant was protective (rr = 0.56, 95% ci = 0.33-0.97). for one to two pregnancies, the rr was 0.76 (ci = 0.42-1.37); for three or more pregnancies, the rr was 0.45 (ci = 0.25-0.81). however, the",reproductive factor colon los angeles county age adjust incidence rate colon men almost high woman however descending sigmoid colon age specific incidence rate woman high men age since menstrual reproductive factor may involve produce crossover age specific rate examine population base control involve white woman adenocarcinoma colon age race neighbourhood match control adjustment factor associate colon family history large bowel total fat intake calcium weight activity level ever pregnant protective rr ci one two pregnancy rr ci three pregnancy rr ci however,a,Colon Cancer
"Has National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month increased endoscopy screening rates and public interest in colorectal cancer National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month occurs each March to promote awareness and screening for colorectal cancer. The effectiveness of this public health campaign is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month on rates of screening endoscopies and on public interest in colorectal cancer. To examine the impact of National Colon Cancer Awareness Month on screening endoscopy rates, the National Endoscopy Database was retrospectively reviewed from 2002 through 2014. A time series of monthly number of colorectal cancer screening endoscopies per endoscopist in the data set was evaluated. To examine public interest in colorectal cancer, Google Trends data were collected on the monthly rates of terms related to colorectal cancer from January 2004 to July 2019. Impact of the month on screening endoscopies and public interest was assessed through an analysis of variance. Seasonality was tested for by how well a sinusoidal model fit the time series as opposed to a linear model utilizing a sum-of-squares F test. Review of National Endoscopy Database yielded 1,398,996 endoscopies, 94% were colonoscopies and 6% sigmoidoscopies, with 47% for colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer screening endoscopy rates were not impacted by the month of the year, and these rates had no seasonality. However, Google searches related to colorectal cancer were significantly impacted by month of the year, specifically March, with significant seasonality observed in the data. National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is associated with an increased public interest in colorectal cancer based on user Google search trends. Yet, this has not translated into a demonstrable increase in the rates of screening. This presents an opportunity to capitalize on this increased public interest and harness this enthusiasm into increased screening.","has national colorectal cancer awareness month increased endoscopy screening rates and public interest in colorectal cancer national colorectal cancer awareness month occurs each march to promote awareness and screening for colorectal cancer. the effectiveness of this public health campaign is unknown. the aim of this study was to determine the impact of national colorectal cancer awareness month on rates of screening endoscopies and on public interest in colorectal cancer. to examine the impact of national colon cancer awareness month on screening endoscopy rates, the national endoscopy database was retrospectively reviewed from 2002 through 2014. a time series of monthly number of colorectal cancer screening endoscopies per endoscopist in the data set was evaluated. to examine public interest in colorectal cancer, google trends data were collected on the monthly rates of terms related to colorectal cancer from january 2004 to july 2019. impact of the month on screening endoscopies and public",national colorectal awareness month increase endoscopy screening rate public interest colorectal national colorectal awareness month occur march promote awareness screening colorectal effectiveness public health campaign unknown determine impact national colorectal awareness month rate screen endoscopy public interest colorectal examine impact national colon awareness month screen endoscopy rate national endoscopy database retrospectively review time series monthly number colorectal screen endoscopy per endoscopist data set evaluate examine public interest colorectal google trend data collect monthly rate term relate colorectal january july impact month screen endoscopy public,a,Colon Cancer

"Teng-Long-Bu-Zhong-Tang, a Chinese herbal formula, enhances anticancer effects of 5--Fluorouracil in CT26 colon carcinoma. Colorectal cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has played a positive role in colorectal cancer treatment. There is a great need to establish effective herbal formula for colorectal cancer treatment. Based on TCM principles and clinical practices, we have established an eight herbs composed formula for colorectal cancer treatment, which is Teng-Long-Bu-Zhong-Tang (TLBZT). We have demonstrated the anticancer effects of TLBZT against colorectal carcinoma in vitro. In present study, we evaluated the anticancer potential of TLBZT, used alone or in combination with low dose of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu), in CT26 colon carcinoma in vivo. CT26 colon carcinoma was established in BALB/c mice and treated with TLBZT, 5-Fu, or TLBZT plus 5-Fu. The tumor volumes were observed. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Caspases activities were detected by colorimetric assay. Cell senescence was indentified by senescence β-galactosidase staining. Gene expression and angiogenesis was observed by immunohistochemistry or western blot. TLBZT significantly inhibited CT26 colon carcinoma growth. TLBZT elicited apoptosis in CT26 colon carcinoma, accompanied by Caspase-3, 8, and 9 activation and PARP cleavage, and downregulation of XIAP and Survivin. TLBZT also induced cell senescence in CT26 colon carcinoma, with concomitant upregulation of p16 and p21 and downregulation of RB phosphorylation. In addition, angiogenesis and VEGF expression in CT26 colon carcinoma was significantly inhibited by TLBZT treatment. Furthermore, TLBZT significantly enhanced anticancer effects of 5-Fu in CT26 colon carcinoma. TLBZT exhibited significantly anticancer effect, and enhanced the effects of 5-Fu in CT26 colon carcinoma, which may correlate with induction of apoptosis and cell senescence, and angiogenesis inhibition. The present study provides new insight into TCM approaches for colon cancer treatment that are worth of further study.","teng-long-bu-zhong-tang, a chinese herbal formula, enhances anticancer effects of 5--fluorouracil in ct26 colon carcinoma. colorectal cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. traditional chinese medicine (tcm) has played a positive role in colorectal cancer treatment. there is a great need to establish effective herbal formula for colorectal cancer treatment. based on tcm principles and clinical practices, we have established an eight herbs composed formula for colorectal cancer treatment, which is teng-long-bu-zhong-tang (tlbzt). we have demonstrated the anticancer effects of tlbzt against colorectal carcinoma in vitro. in present study, we evaluated the anticancer potential of tlbzt, used alone or in combination with low dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), in ct26 colon carcinoma in vivo. ct26 colon carcinoma was established in balb/c mice and treated with tlbzt, 5-fu, or tlbzt plus 5-fu. the tumor volumes were observed. apoptosis was detected by tunel assay. caspases activities were detected by colorimetric",teng long bu zhong tang chinese herbal formula enhances anticancer effect fluorouracil ct colon carcinoma colorectal remain one leading cause death worldwide traditional chinese medicine tcm play positive role colorectal great need establish effective herbal formula colorectal base tcm principle practice establish eight herb compose formula colorectal teng long bu zhong tang tlbzt demonstrate anticancer effect tlbzt colorectal carcinoma vitro present evaluate anticancer potential tlbzt use alone combination low dose fluorouracil fu ct colon carcinoma vivo ct colon carcinoma establish balb c mouse treat tlbzt fu tlbzt plus fu volume observed apoptosis detect tunel assay caspase activity detect colorimetric,a,Colon Cancer
"Applications of Colon Capsule Endoscopy This is a review of colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) with a focus on its recent developments, technological improvements, and current and potential future indications. Based on the current literature, CCE II demonstrates comparable polyp detection rates as optical colonoscopy and CT colonography, and improved cost-effectiveness. The main limitation to patient acceptance is the requirement of a rigorous bowel preparation. Preliminary studies show good correlation between CCE and optical colonoscopy for assessment of colonic disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CCE II is currently FDA, approved as an adjunctive test in patients with prior incomplete colonoscopy, and in the evaluation of patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The test is approved in Europe as one of the options for average-risk colorectal cancer screening, and high-risk screening in patients with contraindications or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy. CCE has a potential role in the evaluation and monitoring of colonic disease activity in IBD. Future technological advances should focus on minimizing bowel preparation, improvement in reading times, and development of therapeutic capabilities. • With technological improvements, the second-generation colon capsule has a significantly higher sensitivity than the first-generation capsule for detection of colon polyps. • Colon capsule endoscopy has been approved in Europe as an option for average-risk colorectal cancer screening, and high-risk screening in patients with contraindications or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy. • Colon capsule endoscopy has received FDA approval as an option for colorectal cancer screening in patients with prior incomplete colonoscopy, and in evaluation of patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding. • Colon capsule endoscopy may have a role in evaluation and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease. • Colon capsule endoscopy currently requires a bowel preparation that is more rigorous than colonoscopy.","applications of colon capsule endoscopy this is a review of colon capsule endoscopy (cce) with a focus on its recent developments, technological improvements, and current and potential future indications. based on the current literature, cce ii demonstrates comparable polyp detection rates as optical colonoscopy and ct colonography, and improved cost-effectiveness. the main limitation to patient acceptance is the requirement of a rigorous bowel preparation. preliminary studies show good correlation between cce and optical colonoscopy for assessment of colonic disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). cce ii is currently fda, approved as an adjunctive test in patients with prior incomplete colonoscopy, and in the evaluation of patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding. the test is approved in europe as one of the options for average-risk colorectal cancer screening, and high-risk screening in patients with contraindications or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy. cce has a potential role in the evaluation and monitoring",application colon capsule endoscopy review colon capsule endoscopy cce focus recent development technological improvement current potential future indication base current literature cce ii demonstrate comparable polyp detection rate optical colonoscopy ct colonography improve cost effectiveness main limitation acceptance requirement rigorous bowel preparation preliminary show good correlation cce optical colonoscopy assessment colonic activity inflammatory bowel ibd cce ii currently fda approve adjunctive test prior incomplete colonoscopy evaluation suspected low gastrointestinal bleed test approve europe one option average risk colorectal screening high risk screen contraindication unwilling undergo colonoscopy cce potential role evaluation monitoring,a,Colon Cancer
"Lung and colon cancer classification using medical imaging: a feature engineering approach. Lung and colon cancers lead to a significant portion of deaths. Their simultaneous occurrence is uncommon, however, in the absence of early diagnosis, the metastasis of cancer cells is very high between these two organs. Currently, histopathological diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only way to improve the chances of survival and reduce cancer mortality. Using artificial intelligence in the histopathological diagnosis of colon and lung cancer can provide significant help to specialists in identifying cases of colon and lung cancers with less effort, time and cost. The objective of this study is to set up a computer-aided diagnostic system that can accurately classify five types of colon and lung tissues (two classes for colon cancer and three classes for lung cancer) by analyzing their histopathological images. Using machine learning, features engineering and image processing techniques, the six models XGBoost, SVM, RF, LDA, MLP and LightGBM were used to perform the classification of histopathological images of lung and colon cancers that were acquired from the LC25000 dataset. The main advantage of using machine learning models is that they allow a better interpretability of the classification model since they are based on feature engineering; however, deep learning models are black box networks whose working is very difficult to understand due to the complex network design. The acquired experimental results show that machine learning models give satisfactory results and are very precise in identifying classes of lung and colon cancer subtypes. The XGBoost model gave the best performance with an accuracy of 99% and a F1-score of 98.8%. The implementation and the development of this model will help healthcare specialists identify types of colon and lung cancers. The code will be available upon request.","lung and colon cancer classification using medical imaging: a feature engineering approach. lung and colon cancers lead to a significant portion of deaths. their simultaneous occurrence is uncommon, however, in the absence of early diagnosis, the metastasis of cancer cells is very high between these two organs. currently, histopathological diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only way to improve the chances of survival and reduce cancer mortality. using artificial intelligence in the histopathological diagnosis of colon and lung cancer can provide significant help to specialists in identifying cases of colon and lung cancers with less effort, time and cost. the objective of this study is to set up a computer-aided diagnostic system that can accurately classify five types of colon and lung tissues (two classes for colon cancer and three classes for lung cancer) by analyzing their histopathological images. using machine learning, features engineering and image processing techniques, the six",lung colon classification use medical image feature engineering approach lung colon lead significant portion death simultaneous occurrence uncommon however absence early diagnosis metastasis cell high two organ currently histopathological diagnosis appropriate way improve chance survival reduce mortality use artificial intelligence histopathological diagnosis colon lung provide significant help specialist identify colon lung less effort time cost set computer aid diagnostic system accurately classify five type colon lung tissue two class colon three class lung analyze histopathological image use machine learning feature engineering image processing techniques six,a,Colon Cancer

"Prognostic value of total number of lymph nodes retrieved differs between left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer in stage III patients with colon cancer. The consensus is that a minimum of 12 lymph nodes should be analyzed at colectomy for colon cancer. However, right colon cancer and left colon cancer have different characteristics, and this threshold value for total number of lymph nodes retrieved may not be universally applicable. The data of 63,243 patients with colon cancer treated between 2004 and 2012 were retrieved from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the predictive value of total number of lymph nodes for survival after adjusting for lymph nodes ratio. The predictive value in left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer was compared. The optimal total number of lymph nodes cutoff value for prediction of overall survival was identified using the online tool Cutoff Finder. Survival of patients with high total number of lymph nodes (≥12) and low total number of lymph nodes (< 12) was compared by Kaplan–Meier analysis. After stratifying by lymph nodes ratio status, total number of lymph nodes≥12 remained an independent predictor of survival in the whole cohort and in right-sided colon cancer, but not in left-sided colon cancer. The optimal cutoff value for total number of lymph nodes was determined to be 11. Low total number of lymph nodes (< 11) was associated with significantly poorer survival after adjusting for lymph nodes ratio in all subgroups except in the subgroup with high lymph nodes ratio (0.5–1.0). Previous reports of the prognostic significance of total number of lymph nodes on node-positive colon cancer were confounded by lymph nodes ratio. The 12-node standard for total number of lymph nodes may not be equally applicable in right-sided colon cancer and left-sided colon cancer.","prognostic value of total number of lymph nodes retrieved differs between left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer in stage iii patients with colon cancer. the consensus is that a minimum of 12 lymph nodes should be analyzed at colectomy for colon cancer. however, right colon cancer and left colon cancer have different characteristics, and this threshold value for total number of lymph nodes retrieved may not be universally applicable. the data of 63,243 patients with colon cancer treated between 2004 and 2012 were retrieved from the national cancer institute’s surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. multivariate cox regression analysis was used to determine the predictive value of total number of lymph nodes for survival after adjusting for lymph nodes ratio. the predictive value in left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer was compared. the optimal total number of lymph nodes cutoff value for prediction of overall survival was identified",prognostic value total number lymph node retrieve differs leave sided colon right side colon stage iii colon consensus minimum lymph node analyze colectomy colon however right colon leave colon different characteristic threshold value total number lymph node retrieve may universally applicable data colon treat retrieve national institute surveillance epidemiology end result database multivariate cox regression use determine predictive value total number lymph node survival adjust lymph node ratio predictive value left side colon right side colon compare optimal total number lymph node cutoff value prediction overall survival identify,a,Colon Cancer
"MASTL induces Colon Cancer progression and Chemoresistance by promoting Wnt/β-catenin signaling Chemotherapeutic agents that modulate cell cycle checkpoints and/or tumor-specific pathways have shown immense promise in preclinical and clinical studies aimed at anti-cancer therapy. MASTL (Greatwall in Xenopus and Drosophila), a serine/threonine kinase controls the final G2/M checkpoint and prevents premature entry of cells into mitosis. Recent studies suggest that MASTL expression is highly upregulated in cancer and confers resistance against chemotherapy. However, the role and mechanism/s of MASTL mediated regulation of tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We utilized a large patient cohort and mouse models of colon cancer as well as colon cancer cells to determine the role of Mastl and associated mechanism in colon cancer. Here, we show that MASTL expression increases in colon cancer across all cancer stages compared with normal colon tissue (P < 0.001). Also, increased levels of MASTL associated with high-risk of the disease and poor prognosis. Further, the shRNA silencing of MASTL expression in colon cancer cells induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and inhibited xenograft-tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic analysis revealed that MASTL expression facilitates colon cancer progression by promoting the β-catenin/Wnt signaling, the key signaling pathway implicated in colon carcinogenesis, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and Survivin. Further studies where colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were subjected to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) treatment revealed a sharp increase in MASTL expression upon chemotherapy, along with increases in Bcl-xL and Survivin expression. Most notably, inhibition of MASTL in these cells induced chemosensitivity to 5FU with downregulation of Survivin and Bcl-xL expression. Overall, our data shed light on the heretofore-undescribed mechanistic role of MASTL in key oncogenic signaling pathway/s to regulate colon cancer progression and chemo-resistance that would tremendously help to overcome drug resistance in colon cancer treatment.","mastl induces colon cancer progression and chemoresistance by promoting wnt/β-catenin signaling chemotherapeutic agents that modulate cell cycle checkpoints and/or tumor-specific pathways have shown immense promise in preclinical and clinical studies aimed at anti-cancer therapy. mastl (greatwall in xenopus and drosophila), a serine/threonine kinase controls the final g2/m checkpoint and prevents premature entry of cells into mitosis. recent studies suggest that mastl expression is highly upregulated in cancer and confers resistance against chemotherapy. however, the role and mechanism/s of mastl mediated regulation of tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. we utilized a large patient cohort and mouse models of colon cancer as well as colon cancer cells to determine the role of mastl and associated mechanism in colon cancer. here, we show that mastl expression increases in colon cancer across all cancer stages compared with normal colon tissue (p < 0.001). also, increased levels of mastl associated with high-risk of the disease and",mastl induces colon progression chemoresistance promote wnt catenin signal chemotherapeutic agent modulate cell cycle checkpoint specific pathway show immense promise preclinical anti therapy mastl greatwall xenopus drosophila serine threonine kinase control final g checkpoint prevents premature entry cell mitosis recent suggest mastl expression highly upregulated confers resistance chemotherapy however role mechanism mastl mediate regulation tumorigenesis remain poorly understood utilize large cohort mouse model colon well colon cell determine role mastl associate mechanism colon show mastl expression increase colon across stage compare normal colon tissue p also increase level mastl associate high risk,a,Colon Cancer
"Environmental factors affect colon carcinoma and rectal carcinoma in men and women differently Colon cancer is thought to be more closely associated with environmental factors than rectal cancer, but evidence is currently insufficient. We examined whether there are differences in the degree of environmental effect on colon cancer and rectal cancer in Japan. We performed a birth cohort analysis for colon and rectal cancers using Japanese vital statistics from 1950 to 1998 and analyzed time trends by cancer site and gender. The mean annual increase in age-adjusted mortality rate from colon cancer was greater than that from rectal cancer and was greater in men than in women. In men left colon cancer showed the greatest rate of increase whereas cancer of the right colon showed only a slight change. Although left colon cancer rapidly increased until the middle 1980s and thereafter showed no change, right colon cancer showed no change until the middle 1980s and thereafter rapidly increased in men. However, the rates of increase in left colon cancer were greater than those in right colon cancer until the middle 1980s, after which a reversal in trend was seen in women. Birth cohort analysis indicates that for all cohorts the mortality rates at the same age were higher in the recent cohorts than in the previous ones. This trend was more marked for colon cancer than for rectal cancer and was stronger among men than among women. Colon cancer is more closely associated than rectal cancer with environmental factors, and this association is more pronounced in men than in women. Consequently cancers at these two sites should not be combined in studies of the role of lifestyle factors in causing these neoplasms. Furthermore, the causes of these diseases may differ in men and women.","environmental factors affect colon carcinoma and rectal carcinoma in men and women differently colon cancer is thought to be more closely associated with environmental factors than rectal cancer, but evidence is currently insufficient. we examined whether there are differences in the degree of environmental effect on colon cancer and rectal cancer in japan. we performed a birth cohort analysis for colon and rectal cancers using japanese vital statistics from 1950 to 1998 and analyzed time trends by cancer site and gender. the mean annual increase in age-adjusted mortality rate from colon cancer was greater than that from rectal cancer and was greater in men than in women. in men left colon cancer showed the greatest rate of increase whereas cancer of the right colon showed only a slight change. although left colon cancer rapidly increased until the middle 1980s and thereafter showed no change, right colon cancer showed no change",environmental factor affect colon carcinoma rectal carcinoma men woman differently colon think closely associate environmental factor rectal evidence currently insufficient examine whether difference degree environmental effect colon rectal japan perform birth cohort colon rectal use japanese vital statistic analyzed time trend site gender mean annual increase age adjust mortality rate colon great rectal great men woman men leave colon show great rate increase whereas right colon show slight change although left colon rapidly increase middle thereafter show change right colon show change,a,Colon Cancer
"Potentiation of antitumor and antimetastatic activities of adriamycin by a novel N-alkylated dihydropyridine, AC394, and its enantiomers in colon cancer-bearing mice Purpose: We have previously shown that a series of N-alkylated 1,4-dihydropyridines potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of vincristine in vincristine-resistant P388 leukemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of one of the compounds, AC394, and its enantiomers to potentiate the antitumor activity of adriamycin against colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The effects of AC394 on potentiation of adriamycin cytotoxicity and enhancement of its accumulation were evaluated using colon 26, HCT-15 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the activities of AC394 and its enantiomers were compared. We also studied the combined effects of (+)-AC394 and adriamycin on subcutaneously (s.c.)-implanted and liver metastasis tumor models. Results: AC394 potentiated the cytotoxicity of adriamycin and enhanced its accumulation in colon cancer cells (colon 26 and HCT-15), which are known to express P-GP (P-glycoprotein) intrinsically. Enhancement of adriamycin accumulation by AC394 was found in s.c.-implanted colon 26 cells in vivo. Although both enantiomers of AC394 showed equal activity in vitro, (+)-AC394 was more effective than (−)-AC394 given orally. (−)-AC394 was found to be cleared more rapidly from the plasma than (+)-AC394. Thus, (+)-AC394 was evaluated for further study. Administration of (+)-AC394 significantly potentiated the antitumor activities of adriamycin in human colon cancer HCT-15 cells implanted s.c. Furthermore, in the liver metastasis model using colon 26 cells, a model completely resistant to adriamycin, the combination therapy of adriamycin with (+)-AC394 produced superior antitumor effects over adriamycin alone. Conclusions: A newly synthesized N-alkylated 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, (+)-AC394, showed superior effects on the potentiation of adriamycin antitumor and antimetastatic activities in vivo. These results suggest that this combination may have therapeutic efficacy not only against primary colon cancers but also against metastatic liver cancer.","potentiation of antitumor and antimetastatic activities of adriamycin by a novel n-alkylated dihydropyridine, ac394, and its enantiomers in colon cancer-bearing mice purpose: we have previously shown that a series of n-alkylated 1,4-dihydropyridines potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of vincristine in vincristine-resistant p388 leukemia. the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of one of the compounds, ac394, and its enantiomers to potentiate the antitumor activity of adriamycin against colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. methods: the effects of ac394 on potentiation of adriamycin cytotoxicity and enhancement of its accumulation were evaluated using colon 26, hct-15 and mcf-7 cells. furthermore, the activities of ac394 and its enantiomers were compared. we also studied the combined effects of (+)-ac394 and adriamycin on subcutaneously (s.c.)-implanted and liver metastasis tumor models. results: ac394 potentiated the cytotoxicity of adriamycin and enhanced its accumulation in colon cancer cells (colon 26 and hct-15), which are",potentiation antitumor antimetastatic activity adriamycin novel n alkylated dihydropyridine ac enantiomer colon bearing mouse previously show series n alkylated dihydropyridines potentiate therapeutic efficacy vincristine vincristine resistant p leukemia investigate ability one compound ac enantiomer potentiate antitumor activity adriamycin colon cell vitro vivo method effect ac potentiation adriamycin cytotoxicity enhancement accumulation evaluate use colon hct mcf cell furthermore activity ac enantiomer compare also combined effect ac adriamycin subcutaneously c implant liver metastasis model result ac potentiate cytotoxicity adriamycin enhance accumulation colon cell colon hct,a,Colon Cancer
"Local recurrence after curative resection in patients with colon and rectal cancers. There are a range of rates and a number of prognostic factors associated with the local recurrence of colorectal cancer after curative resection. The aim of this study was to identify the potential prognostic factors of local recurrence in patients with colon and rectal cancers. A retrospective review of 1,838 patients who underwent curative resection of non-metastatic colorectal cancer was conducted. The patients were treated between 1994 and 2004, and had a minimum follow-up of 3 years. There were 994 patients with colon cancer and 844 patients with rectal cancer. The median duration of follow-up was 60.9 ± 24.5 months. With respect to colon cancer, the local recurrence rate was 6.1% (61 patients). With respect to rectal cancer, 95 patients had a local recurrence (11.3%), the rate of which was statistically greater than the local recurrence rate for colon cancer (p < 0.001). The overall recurrence rate was 16.4% (301 patients), and the local recurrence rate, with or without systemic metastases, was 8.5% (156 patients). Local recurrences occurred within 2 and 3 years in 59.9% and 82.4% of the patients, respectively. In patients with colon and rectal cancer, the pathologic T stage (p = 0.044 and p = 0.034, respectively), pathologic N stage (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.013 and p = 0.004, respectively) were adverse risk factors for local recurrence. The level of the anastomosis from the anal verge was an additional prognostic factor (p = 0.007) in patients with rectal cancer.

"Long-term diuretic therapy in patients with coronary disease: increased colon cancer-related mortality over a 5-year follow-up. Objectives: Recent studies have suggested that long-term diuretic therapy may be associated with increased risk of renal cell carcinoma. This carcinoma is not a common malignancy, but it shares risk factors with the considerably more widespread colon cancer (CC). However, there are no data whether or not a relationship between long-term diuretic therapy and CC mortality exists. In this study we tested the hypothesis that long-term diuretic therapy may be associated with increased CC mortality over a 5.6-year follow-up period. Subjects and methods: The study sample comprised 14 166 patients aged 45 to 74 years with a previous myocardial infarction and/or stable anginal syndrome, screened for participation in the bezafibrate infarction prevention (BIP) study. There were 2153 patients receiving diuretics and 12 013 patients receiving no diuretics. Results: During the follow-up 139 (6.5%) new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the diuretic–treated group compared with 622 (5.2%) in the group receiving no diuretics (P = 0.02). Colon cancer mortality was significantly higher in the diuretic-treated patients (0.1 vs 0.5%, P = 0.001), whereas mortality differences for other cancer types were not documented. Multivariate analysis identified diuretics as an independent predictor of increased colon cancer incidence and colon cancer mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.0 (95% CI 1.2–3.2) for colon cancer incidence and 3.7 (95% CI 1.7–8.3) for mortality. However, the association between diuretic therapy and higher incidence of colon cancer was observed only among non-users of aspirin. A relatively lower colon cancer incidence was observed in the furosemide subgroup, and higher in the small combined amiloride/hydrochlorthiazide subgroup (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.15–8.65). Conclusion: Long-term exposure to diuretic therapy may be associated with an increased colon cancer-related mortality.","long-term diuretic therapy in patients with coronary disease: increased colon cancer-related mortality over a 5-year follow-up. objectives: recent studies have suggested that long-term diuretic therapy may be associated with increased risk of renal cell carcinoma. this carcinoma is not a common malignancy, but it shares risk factors with the considerably more widespread colon cancer (cc). however, there are no data whether or not a relationship between long-term diuretic therapy and cc mortality exists. in this study we tested the hypothesis that long-term diuretic therapy may be associated with increased cc mortality over a 5.6-year follow-up period. subjects and methods: the study sample comprised 14 166 patients aged 45 to 74 years with a previous myocardial infarction and/or stable anginal syndrome, screened for participation in the bezafibrate infarction prevention (bip) study. there were 2153 patients receiving diuretics and 12 013 patients receiving no diuretics. results: during the follow-up 139 (6.5%) new",long term diuretic therapy coronary increase colon relate mortality year follow recent suggest long term diuretic therapy may associate increased risk renal cell carcinoma carcinoma common malignancy share risk factor considerably widespread colon cc however data whether relationship long term diuretic therapy cc mortality exist test hypothesis long term diuretic therapy may associate increased cc mortality year follow period subject method sample comprise age year previous myocardial infarction stable anginal syndrome screen participation bezafibrate infarction prevention bip receive diuretic receive diuretic result follow new,a,Colon Cancer

"Circ_0055625 knockdown inhibits tumorigenesis and improves radiosensitivity by regulating miR-338-3p/MSI1 axis in colon cancer. Radiotherapy is a main therapeutic method for cancers, including colon cancer. In the current study, we aim to explore the effects of circular RNA (circRNA) circ_0055625 in the progression and radiosensitivity of colon cancer and the underlying mechanism. The expression of circ_0055625 and musashi homolog 1 (MSI1) mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MSI1 protein expression was determined by Western blot. Cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Cell survival fraction, apoptosis, and invasion were investigated by colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis, and transwell invasion assay, respectively. Cell migration was detected by wound-healing and transwell migration assays. The binding relationship between microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p) and circ_0055625 or MSI1 was predicted by online databases and identified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay. The effects of circ_0055625 silencing on the tumor formation and radiosensitivity of colon cancer in vivo were explored by in vivo tumor formation assay. Circ_0055625 and MSI1 were upregulated in colon cancer tissues and cells relative to control groups. Radiation treatment apparently increased the expression of circ_0055625 and MSI1 in colon cancer cells. Circ_0055625 knockdown or MSI1 silencing repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis and radiosensitivity in colon cancer. Also, circ_0055625 silencing-mediated effects were attenuated by MSI1 overexpression. Additionally, circ_0055625 silencing reduced MSI1 expression, which could be attenuated by miR-338-3p inhibitor. Mechanically, circ_0055625 acted as a sponge for miR-338-3p to regulate MSI1. Furthermore, circ_0055625 knockdown hindered tumor growth and improved radiosensitivity in vivo. Circ_0055625 repression inhibited the progression and radioresistance of colon cancer by downregulating MSI1 through sponging miR-338-3p.

"High lactose whey cheese consumption and risk of colorectal cancer - The Norwegian Women and Cancer Study The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41).

"Activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer and is up-regulated upon heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibition Activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) is involved in the complex process of cellular stress response. However, its exact role in cancer is discussed controversially because both tumor suppressive and oncogenic effects have been described. Here we followed-up on our previous observation that inhibition of Hsp90 may increase ATF3 expression and sought to determine the role of ATF3 in colon cancer. Regulation of ATF3 was determined in cancer cells using signaling inhibitors and a heat-shock protein-90 (Hsp90) antagonist. Human HCT116 cancer cells were stably transfected with an ATF3-shRNA or a luciferase-shRNA expression plasmid and alterations in cell motility were assessed in migration assays. The impact of ATF3 down-regulation on cancer growth and metastasis were investigated in a subcutaneous tumor model, a model of hepatic tumor growth and in a model of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Human colon cancer tissues were analyzed for ATF3 expression. The results show that therapeutic Hsp90 inhibition substantially up-regulates the expression of ATF3 in various cancer cells, including colon, gastric and pancreatic cancer. This effect was evident both in vitro and in vivo. RNAi mediated knock-down of ATF3 in HCT116 colon cancer cells significantly increased cancer cell migration in vitro. Moreover, in xenogenic mouse models, ATF3 knock-down promoted subcutaneous tumor growth and hepatic metastasis, as well as peritoneal carcinomatosis. Importantly, ATF3 expression was lower in human colon cancer specimens, as compared to corresponding normal surrounding tissues, suggesting that ATF3 may represent a down-regulated tumor suppressor in colon cancer. In conclusion, ATF3 down-regulation in colon cancer promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Considering that blocking Hsp90 induces ATF3 expression, Hsp90 inhibition may represent a valid strategy to treat metastatic colon cancer by up-regulating this anti-metastatic transcription factor.","activating transcription factor-3 (atf3) functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer and is up-regulated upon heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) inhibition activating transcription factor-3 (atf3) is involved in the complex process of cellular stress response. however, its exact role in cancer is discussed controversially because both tumor suppressive and oncogenic effects have been described. here we followed-up on our previous observation that inhibition of hsp90 may increase atf3 expression and sought to determine the role of atf3 in colon cancer. regulation of atf3 was determined in cancer cells using signaling inhibitors and a heat-shock protein-90 (hsp90) antagonist. human hct116 cancer cells were stably transfected with an atf3-shrna or a luciferase-shrna expression plasmid and alterations in cell motility were assessed in migration assays. the impact of atf3 down-regulation on cancer growth and metastasis were investigated in a subcutaneous tumor model, a model of hepatic tumor growth and in a model of",activate transcription factor atf function suppressor colon regulated upon heat shock protein hsp inhibition activate transcription factor atf involve complex process cellular stress response however exact role discuss controversially suppressive oncogenic effect describe follow previous observation inhibition hsp may increase atf expression seek determine role atf colon regulation atf determine cell use signal inhibitor heat shock protein hsp antagonist human hct cell stably transfected atf shrna luciferase shrna expression plasmid alteration cell motility assess migration assay impact atf regulation growth metastasis investigate subcutaneous model model hepatic growth model,a,Colon Cancer
"Distribution of colorectal cancer in young African Americans: implications for the choice of screening test. We recently reported on a left-sided predominance of colorectal cancers in the young (under age 50). Given the predilection of young African Americans for the disease, we wondered if there may be a difference in the biology of colorectal carcinogenesis between this group and Caucasians. Compare the distribution of colorectal cancer in African American patients and Caucasians under age 50, and describe implications for screening in these groups. Colorectal cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 50 between the years 2000 and 2016. All races other than African American and Caucasian and all patients with hereditary colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. Outcome measures: race, age at diagnosis (5 subgroups: < 20, 20–29, 30–39, 40–44, and 45–49 years) and cancer location; right (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure), left (descending colon and sigmoid colon), or rectal. 759 patients were included; 695 (91.6%) were Caucasian and 64 (8.4%) were African American. Most cases were diagnosed between ages 40 and 49 (African American = 75%, Caucasian = 69.5%). Rectal cancer was most common in both races, although significantly more common in Caucasian than in African American patients (64.2% vs 39.1%). Right colon cancer was more commonly found in African Americans (37.5%) compared with Caucasians (18%) (p = 0.0002). The ratio of rectal to right-sided colon cancer in African Americans was 1:1 compared with 3.6:1 in Caucasians. Relatively low number of African American patients The high rate of right-sided cancer in young African American patients means that they should be screened with colonoscopy.

"Identification of the active substances and mechanisms of ginger for the treatment of colon cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking Colon cancer is occurring at an increasing rate and ginger (Zingiber officinale), as a commonly used herbal medicine, has been suggested as a potential agent for colon cancer. This study was aimed to identify the bioactive components and potential mechanisms of ginger for colon cancer prevention by an integrated network pharmacology approach. The putative ingredients of ginger and its related targets were discerned from the TCMSP  and Swiss target prediction database. After that, the targets interacting with colon cancer were collected using Genecards, OMIM, and Drugbank databases. KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis were performed to explore the signaling pathways related to ginger for colon cancer treatments. The PPI and compound-target-disease networks were constructed using Cytoscape 3.8.1. Finally, Discovery studio software was employed to confirm the key genes and active components from ginger. Six potential active compounds, 285 interacting targets in addition to 1356 disease-related targets were collected, of which 118 intersection targets were obtained. A total of 34 key targets including PIK3CA, SRC, and TP53 were identified through PPI network analysis. These targets were mainly focused on the biological processes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, cellular response to oxidative stress, and cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus. The KEGG enrichment manifested that three signaling pathways were closely related to colon cancer prevention of ginger, cancer, endocrine resistance, and hepatitis B pathways. TP53, HSP90AA1, and JAK2 were viewed as the most important genes, which were validated by molecular docking simulation. This study demonstrated that ginger produced preventive effects against colon cancer by regulating multi-targets and multi-pathways with multi-components. And, the combined data provide novel insight for ginger compounds developed as new drug for anti-colon cancer.","identification of the active substances and mechanisms of ginger for the treatment of colon cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking colon cancer is occurring at an increasing rate and ginger (zingiber officinale), as a commonly used herbal medicine, has been suggested as a potential agent for colon cancer. this study was aimed to identify the bioactive components and potential mechanisms of ginger for colon cancer prevention by an integrated network pharmacology approach. the putative ingredients of ginger and its related targets were discerned from the tcmsp and swiss target prediction database. after that, the targets interacting with colon cancer were collected using genecards, omim, and drugbank databases. kegg pathway and go enrichment analysis were performed to explore the signaling pathways related to ginger for colon cancer treatments. the ppi and compound-target-disease networks were constructed using cytoscape 3.8.1. finally, discovery studio software was employed to confirm the key genes",identification active substance mechanism ginger colon base network pharmacology molecular docking colon occur increase rate ginger zingiber officinale commonly use herbal medicine suggest potential agent colon identify bioactive component potential mechanism ginger colon prevention integrated network pharmacology approach putative ingredient ginger related target discern tcmsp swiss target prediction database target interact colon collect use genecards omim drugbank database kegg pathway go enrichment perform explore signaling pathway relate ginger colon treatments ppi compound target network construct use cytoscape finally discovery studio software employ confirm key gene,a,Colon Cancer
"Cholesterol reprograms glucose and lipid metabolism to promote proliferation in colon cancer cells. Hypercholesterolemia is often correlated with obesity which is considered a risk factor for various cancers. With the growing population of hypercholesterolemic individuals, there is a need to understand the role of increased circulatory cholesterol or dietary cholesterol intake towards cancer etiology and pathology. Recently, abnormality in the blood cholesterol level of colon cancer patients has been reported. In the present study, we demonstrate that alteration in cholesterol levels (through a high-cholesterol or high-fat diet) increases the incidence of chemical carcinogen-induced colon polyp occurrence and tumor progression in mice. At the cellular level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) promote colon cancer cell proliferation by tuning the cellular glucose and lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, supplementation of LDLc or HDLc promotes cellular glucose uptake, and utilization, thereby, causing an increase in lactate production by colon cancer cells. Moreover, LDLc or HDLc upregulates aerobic glycolysis, causing an increase in total ATP production through glycolysis, and a decrease in ATP generation by OXPHOS. Interestingly, the shift in the metabolic status towards a more glycolytic phenotype upon the availability of cholesterol supports rapid cell proliferation. Additionally, an alteration in the expression of the molecules involved in cholesterol uptake along with the increase in lipid and cholesterol accumulation was observed in cells supplemented with LDLc or HDLc. These results indicate that colon cancer cells directly utilize the cholesterol associated with LDLc or HDLc. Moreover, targeting glucose metabolism through LDH inhibitor (oxamate) drastically abrogates the cellular proliferation induced by LDLc or HDLc. Collectively, we illustrate the vital role of cholesterol in regulating the cellular glucose and lipid metabolism of cancer cells and its direct effect on the colon tumorigenesis.","cholesterol reprograms glucose and lipid metabolism to promote proliferation in colon cancer cells. hypercholesterolemia is often correlated with obesity which is considered a risk factor for various cancers. with the growing population of hypercholesterolemic individuals, there is a need to understand the role of increased circulatory cholesterol or dietary cholesterol intake towards cancer etiology and pathology. recently, abnormality in the blood cholesterol level of colon cancer patients has been reported. in the present study, we demonstrate that alteration in cholesterol levels (through a high-cholesterol or high-fat diet) increases the incidence of chemical carcinogen-induced colon polyp occurrence and tumor progression in mice. at the cellular level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldlc) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdlc) promote colon cancer cell proliferation by tuning the cellular glucose and lipid metabolism. mechanistically, supplementation of ldlc or hdlc promotes cellular glucose uptake, and utilization, thereby, causing an increase in lactate production by colon cancer cells.",cholesterol reprograms glucose lipid metabolism promote proliferation colon cell hypercholesterolemia often correlate obesity consider risk factor various grow population hypercholesterolemic individual need understand role increased circulatory cholesterol dietary cholesterol intake towards etiology pathology recently abnormality blood cholesterol level colon report present demonstrate alteration cholesterol level high cholesterol high fat diet increase incidence chemical carcinogen induce colon polyp occurrence progression mouse cellular level low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc promote colon cell proliferation tune cellular glucose lipid metabolism mechanistically supplementation ldlc hdlc promotes cellular glucose uptake utilization thereby cause increase lactate production colon cell,a,Colon Cancer

"Identification of histone methyltransferase NSD2 as an important oncogenic gene in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second common cause of cancer-related human mortalities. Dysregulation of histone 3 (H3) methylation could lead to transcriptional activation of multiple oncogenes, which is closely associated with CRC tumorigenesis and progression. Nuclear receptor-binding SET Domain protein 2 (NSD2) is a key histone methyltransferase catalyzing histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). Its expression, the potential functions, and molecular mechanisms in CRC are studied here. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) bioinformatics results showed that the NSD2 mRNA expression is elevated in both colon cancers and rectal cancers. Furthermore, NSD2 mRNA and protein expression levels in local colon cancer tissues are significantly higher than those in matched surrounding normal tissues. In primary human colon cancer cells and established CRC cell lines, shRNA-induced silencing or CRISPR/Cas9-induced knockout of NSD2 inhibited cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, NSD2 shRNA or knockout induced mitochondrial depolarization, DNA damage, and apoptosis in the primary and established CRC cells. Contrarily, ectopic NSD2 overexpression in primary colon cancer cells further enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. H3K36me2, expressions of multiple oncogenes (ADAM9, EGFR, Sox2, Bcl-2, SYK, and MET) and Akt activation were significantly decreased after NSD2 silencing or knockout in primary colon cancer cells. Their levels were however increased after ectopic NSD2 overexpression. A catalytic inactive NSD2 (Y1179A) also inhibited H3K36me2, multiple oncogenes expression, and Akt activation, as well as cell proliferation and migration in primary colon cancer cells. In vivo, intratumoral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-packed NSD2 shRNA largely inhibited primary colon cancer cell xenograft growth in nude mice. Together, NSD2 exerted oncogenic functions in CRC and could be a promising therapeutic target.","identification of histone methyltransferase nsd2 as an important oncogenic gene in colorectal cancer colorectal cancer (crc) is the second common cause of cancer-related human mortalities. dysregulation of histone 3 (h3) methylation could lead to transcriptional activation of multiple oncogenes, which is closely associated with crc tumorigenesis and progression. nuclear receptor-binding set domain protein 2 (nsd2) is a key histone methyltransferase catalyzing histone h3 lysine 36 dimethylation (h3k36me2). its expression, the potential functions, and molecular mechanisms in crc are studied here. gene expression profiling interactive analysis (gepia) bioinformatics results showed that the nsd2 mrna expression is elevated in both colon cancers and rectal cancers. furthermore, nsd2 mrna and protein expression levels in local colon cancer tissues are significantly higher than those in matched surrounding normal tissues. in primary human colon cancer cells and established crc cell lines, shrna-induced silencing or crispr/cas9-induced knockout of nsd2 inhibited cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression,",identification histone methyltransferase nsd important oncogenic gene colorectal colorectal crc second common cause relate human mortality dysregulation histone h methylation could lead transcriptional activation multiple oncogene closely associate crc tumorigenesis progression nuclear receptor binding set domain protein nsd key histone methyltransferase catalyze histone h lysine dimethylation h k expression potential function molecular mechanism crc gene expression profile interactive gepia bioinformatics result show nsd mrna expression elevate colon rectal furthermore nsd mrna protein expression level local colon tissue significantly high matched surround normal tissue primary human colon cell establish crc cell line shrna induce silence crispr ca induce knockout nsd inhibit cell viability proliferation cell cycle progression,a,Colon Cancer
"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and suppresses the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating STAT3/CXCL8 pathway. Colon cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. Tea catechin exerts anti-tumor effects in colon cancer. This work aimed to determine the functions of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the main active components of Tea catechins, in the progression of colon cancer. In this work, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting was utilized to examine the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, STAT3, p-STAT3 and CXCL8 in colon cancer patients and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of colon cancer patients, and the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 and CXCL8 was elevated in the neutrophils derived from colon cancer patients. Moreover, neutrophils were treated with phorbol ester (PMA) or DNase I to induce or impede the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Both STAT3 overexpression and PMA treatment promoted the expression of CXCL8, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) in the colon cancer-derived neutrophils, indicating that STAT3 overexpression facilitated the formation of NETs. STAT3 deficiency suppressed the formation of NETs, which consistent with the results of DNase I treatment. Transwell assay was utilized to detect the migration and invasion of colon cancer cell line SW480. EGCG treatment suppressed the formation of NETs and the expression of STAT3 and CXCL8 in the colon cancer-derived neutrophils, and then inhibited the migration and invasion of SW480 cells. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that EGCG inhibited the formation of NETs and subsequent suppressed the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating STAT3/CXCL8 signalling pathway. Thus, this study suggests that EGCG may become a potential drug for colon cancer therapy.","epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and suppresses the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating stat3/cxcl8 pathway. colon cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. tea catechin exerts anti-tumor effects in colon cancer. this work aimed to determine the functions of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), one of the main active components of tea catechins, in the progression of colon cancer. in this work, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay, quantitative real-time pcr and western blotting was utilized to examine the levels of il-1β, tnf-α, stat3, p-stat3 and cxcl8 in colon cancer patients and healthy controls. compared with healthy controls, the levels of il-1β and tnf-α were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of colon cancer patients, and the expression of stat3, p-stat3 and cxcl8 was elevated in the neutrophils derived from colon cancer patients. moreover, neutrophils were treated with phorbol ester (pma) or dnase i to induce",epigallocatechin gallate inhibit formation neutrophil extracellular trap suppress migration invasion colon cell regulate stat cxcl pathway colon common malignant digestive tract tea catechin exerts anti effect colon work determine function epigallocatechin gallate egcg one main active component tea catechin progression colon work enzyme link immune sorbent assay quantitative real time pcr western blotting utilize examine level il tnf stat p stat cxcl colon healthy control compare healthy control level il tnf significantly increase peripheral blood colon expression stat p stat cxcl elevate neutrophil derive colon moreover neutrophil treat phorbol ester pma dnase induce,a,Colon Cancer

"Correction to: Bazedoxifene as a novel GP130 inhibitor for Colon Cancer therapy. Interleukin-11 (IL-11), a dominant IL-6 family cytokine, is involved in tumorigenesis, tumor progression and differentiation in colon cancer cells. IL-11 signaling has been recently identified as a potential therapeutic target in colon cancer. Bazedoxifene, a third- generation selective estrogen modulator approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is a novel inhibitor of IL-11/GP130 signaling discovered by docking modeling. In this study, the inhibition efficacy of bazedoxifene in colon cancer cells and its potential mechanism were investigated in vitro and in vivo by using MTT cell viability assay, BrdU cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing/cell migration assay, immunofluorescence, western blot assay and the mouse xenograft tumor model. Bazedoxifene inhibits phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and its nuclear translocation induced by IL-11 in colon cancer cells. It also inhibits p-STAT3 induced by IL-6 and IL-11 but not by OSM or STAT1 phosphorylation induced by INF-γ in human colon cancer cells. In addition, bazedoxifene can significantly inhibit phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 downstream targets. Furthermore, bazedoxifene alone or together with oxaliplatin can significantly induce apoptosis, inhibit cell viability, cell colony formation and cell migration in colon cancer cells. Knock-down of IL-11R can reduce the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to bazedoxifene. IL-11 can reduce the efficacy of oxaliplatin-mediated inhibition of cell viability. Consistent with in vitro findings, bazedoxifene alone also attenuated HCT-15 xenograft tumor burden and reduced p-STAT3, p-AKT and p-ERK in vivo. Its combination with oxaliplatin attenuated DLD-1 xenograft tumor burden and reduced p-STAT3 in vivo.

"Targeting SERT promotes tryptophan metabolism: mechanisms and implications in colon cancer treatment. Serotonin signaling has been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Targeting the serotonin transporter to block serotonin cellular uptake confers antineoplastic effects in various tumors, including colon cancer. However, the antineoplastic mechanism of serotonin transporter inhibition and serotonin metabolism alterations in the absence of serotonin transporter have not been elucidated, especially in colon cancer, which might limit anti-tumor effects associating with targeting serotonin transporter. The promotion in the uptake and catabolism of extracellular tryptophan and targeting serotonin transporter was detected by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Western blotting Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence was utilized to research the serotonylation of mTOR by serotonin and serotonin transporter inhibition. The primary mouse model, homograft model and tissue microarry was used to explore the tryptophan pathway in colon cancer. The cell viability assay, western blotting, xenograft and primary colon cancer mouse model were used to identify whether the combination of sertraline and tryptophan restriction had a synergistic effect. Targeting serotonin transporter through genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition in vitro and in vivo induced a compensatory effect by promoting the uptake and catabolism of extracellular tryptophan in colon cancer. Mechanistically, targeting serotonin transporter suppressed mTOR serotonylation, leading to mTOR inactivation and increased tryptophan uptake. In turn, this process promoted serotonin biosynthesis and oncogenic metabolite kynurenine production through enhanced tryptophan catabolism. Tryptophan deprivation, or blocking its uptake by using trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, can sensitize colon cancer to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The present study elucidated a novel feedback mechanism involved in the regulation of serotonin homeostasis and suggested innovative strategies for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-based treatment of colon cancer.","targeting sert promotes tryptophan metabolism: mechanisms and implications in colon cancer treatment. serotonin signaling has been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. targeting the serotonin transporter to block serotonin cellular uptake confers antineoplastic effects in various tumors, including colon cancer. however, the antineoplastic mechanism of serotonin transporter inhibition and serotonin metabolism alterations in the absence of serotonin transporter have not been elucidated, especially in colon cancer, which might limit anti-tumor effects associating with targeting serotonin transporter. the promotion in the uptake and catabolism of extracellular tryptophan and targeting serotonin transporter was detected by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. western blotting immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence was utilized to research the serotonylation of mtor by serotonin and serotonin transporter inhibition. the primary mouse model, homograft model and tissue microarry was used to explore the tryptophan pathway in colon cancer. the cell viability assay, western",target sert promotes tryptophan metabolism mechanism implication colon serotonin signaling associate tumorigenesis progression target serotonin transporter block serotonin cellular uptake confers antineoplastic effect various include colon however antineoplastic mechanism serotonin transporter inhibition serotonin metabolism alteration absence serotonin transporter elucidate especially colon might limit anti effect associate target serotonin transporter promotion uptake catabolism extracellular tryptophan target serotonin transporter detect use quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction western blotting liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry western blot immunoprecipitation immunofluorescence utilize research serotonylation mtor serotonin serotonin transporter inhibition primary mouse model homograft model tissue microarry use explore tryptophan pathway colon cell viability assay western,a,Colon Cancer
"PADI3 plays an antitumor role via the Hsp90/CKS1 pathway in colon cancer. CKS1 is highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and is essential for cancer cell proliferation. The downstream molecular mechanism of CKS1 has been fully studied, but the upstream regulatory mechanism of it is still unclear. Earlier research found that PADI3 plays its anti-tumor roles via suppress cell proliferation, in this study, we found that the expression pattern of PADI3 and CKS1 are negatively correlated in colon cancer tissues, and overexpression of PADI3 can partly reverse CKS1 induced cancer cell proliferation. However, the regulatory mechanism of PADI3 and CKS1 in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer is still unclear and need to do further research. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression levels of genes. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to examine cell proliferation and colony formation ability. Overexpression and rescue experiments were used to study the molecular mechanism of CKS1 in colon cancer cells, BALB/c nude mice were used to study the function of CKS1 in vivo. CKS1 is highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and the overexpression of CKS1 promotes cell proliferation and colony formation in both HCT116 (originating from primary colon cancer) and SW620 (originating from metastatic tumor nodules of colon cancer) cells. CKS1-expressing HCT116 cells produced larger tumors than the control cells. The expression pattern of PADI3 and CKS1 are negatively correlation in clinical samples of colon cancer, further study indicates that PADI3 can significantly decrease Hsp90 and CKS1 expression, and Hsp90 is essential for PADI3 to downregulate CKS1expression in colon cancer cells.

"Inhibition of TRPM7 suppresses cell proliferation of colon adenocarcinoma in vitro and induces hypomagnesemia in vivo without affecting azoxymethane-induced early colon cancer in mice Magnesium (Mg2+) is an essential cation implicated in carcinogenesis, solid tumor progression and metastatic potential. The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin Member 7 (TRPM7) is a divalent ion channel involved in cellular and systemic Mg2+ homeostasis. Abnormal expression of TRPM7 is found in numerous cancers, including colon, implicating TRPM7 in this process. To establish a possible link between systemic magnesium (Mg2+) status, the Mg2+ conducting channel TRPM7 in colon epithelial cells, and colon carcinogenesis, in vitro whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, qPCR, and pharmacological tools were used probing human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 as well as normal primary mouse colon epithelial cells. This was extended to and combined with aberrant crypt foci development in an azoxymethane-induced colorectal cancer mouse model under hypomagnesemia induced by diet or pharmacologic intervention. We find that TRPM7 drives colon cancer cell proliferation in human HT-29 and expresses in normal primary mouse colon epithelia. This is linked to TRPM7’s dominant role as Mg2+ transporter, since high extracellular Mg2+ supplementation cannot rescue inhibition of cell proliferation caused by suppressing TRPM7 either genetically or pharmacologically. In vivo experiments in mice provide evidence that the specific TRPM7 inhibitor waixenicin A, given as a single bolus injection, induces transient hypomagnesemia and increases intestinal absorption of calcium. Repeated injections of waixenicin A over 3 weeks cause hypomagnesemia via insufficient Mg2+ absorption by the colon. However, neither waixenicin A, nor a diet low in Mg2+, affect aberrant crypt foci development in an azoxymethane-induced colorectal cancer mouse model. Early stage colon cancer proceeds independent of systemic Mg2+ status and TRPM7, and waixenicin A is a useful pharmacological tool to study of TRPM7 in vitro and in vivo.","inhibition of trpm7 suppresses cell proliferation of colon adenocarcinoma in vitro and induces hypomagnesemia in vivo without affecting azoxymethane-induced early colon cancer in mice magnesium (mg2+) is an essential cation implicated in carcinogenesis, solid tumor progression and metastatic potential. the transient receptor potential melastatin member 7 (trpm7) is a divalent ion channel involved in cellular and systemic mg2+ homeostasis. abnormal expression of trpm7 is found in numerous cancers, including colon, implicating trpm7 in this process. to establish a possible link between systemic magnesium (mg2+) status, the mg2+ conducting channel trpm7 in colon epithelial cells, and colon carcinogenesis, in vitro whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, qpcr, and pharmacological tools were used probing human colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 as well as normal primary mouse colon epithelial cells. this was extended to and combined with aberrant crypt foci development in an azoxymethane-induced colorectal cancer mouse model under hypomagnesemia induced by diet or pharmacologic intervention. we",inhibition trpm suppresses cell proliferation colon adenocarcinoma vitro induces hypomagnesemia vivo without affect azoxymethane induce early colon mice magnesium mg essential cation implicate carcinogenesis solid progression metastatic potential transient receptor potential melastatin member trpm divalent ion channel involve cellular systemic mg homeostasis abnormal expression trpm find numerous include colon implicate trpm process establish possible link systemic magnesium mg status mg conduct channel trpm colon epithelial cell colon carcinogenesis vitro whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology qpcr pharmacological tool use probe human colorectal adenocarcinoma ht well normal primary mouse colon epithelial cell extend combine aberrant crypt focus development azoxymethane induce colorectal mouse model hypomagnesemia induce diet pharmacologic intervention,a,Colon Cancer
"Down-regulation of malignant potential by alpha linolenic acid in human and mouse colon cancer cells. Omega-3 fatty acids (also called ω-3 fatty acis or n-3 fatty acid) are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a double bond (C=C) at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. Numerous test tube and animal studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids may prevent or inhibit the growth of cancers, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids are important in cancer physiology. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of an essential omega-3 fatty acid and organic compound found in seeds (chia and flaxseed), nuts (notably walnuts), and many common vegetable oils. ALA has also been shown to down-regulate cell proliferation of prostate, breast, and bladder cancer cells. However, direct evidence that ALA suppresses to the development of colon cancer has not been studied. Also, no previous studies have evaluated whether ALA may regulate malignant potential (adhesion, invasion and colony formation) in colon cancer cells. In order to address the questions above, we conducted in vitro studies and evaluated whether ALA may down-regulate malignant potential in human (HT29 and HCT116) and mouse (MCA38) colon cancer cell lines. We observed that treatment with 1–5 mM of ALA inhibits cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in both human and mouse colon cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we observed that ALA did not decrease total colony numbers when compared to control. By contrast, we found that size of colony was significantly changed by ALA treatment when compared to control in all colon cancer cell lines. We suggest that our data enhance our current knowledge of ALA’s mechanism and provide crucial information to further the development of new therapies for the management or chemoprevention of colon cancer.","down-regulation of malignant potential by alpha linolenic acid in human and mouse colon cancer cells. omega-3 fatty acids (also called ω-3 fatty acis or n-3 fatty acid) are polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) with a double bond (c=c) at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. numerous test tube and animal studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids may prevent or inhibit the growth of cancers, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids are important in cancer physiology. alpha-linolenic acid (ala) is one of an essential omega-3 fatty acid and organic compound found in seeds (chia and flaxseed), nuts (notably walnuts), and many common vegetable oils. ala has also been shown to down-regulate cell proliferation of prostate, breast, and bladder cancer cells. however, direct evidence that ala suppresses to the development of colon cancer has not been studied. also, no previous studies have evaluated whether ala may regulate malignant",regulation malignant potential alpha linolenic acid human mouse colon cell omega fatty acid also call fatty acis n fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas double bond c c third carbon atom end carbon chain numerous test tube animal show omega fatty acid may prevent inhibit growth suggest omega fatty acid important physiology alpha linolenic acid ala one essential omega fatty acid organic compound find seed chia flaxseed nut notably walnut many common vegetable oil ala also show regulate cell proliferation prostate breast bladder cell however direct evidence ala suppresses development colon also previous evaluate whether ala may regulate malignant,a,Colon Cancer
"Association of sedentary behaviour with colon and rectal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies. Sedentary behaviour is ubiquitous in modern society. Emerging studies have focused on the health consequences of sedentary behaviour, including colorectal cancer, but whether sedentary behaviour is associated with the risks of colon and rectal cancer remains unclear. No systematic reviews have applied quantitative techniques to independently compute summary risk estimates. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate this issue. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases up to May 2013 to identify cohort and case–control studies that evaluated the association between sedentary behaviour and colon or rectal cancer. A random-effect model was used to pool the results of included studies. Publication bias was assessed by using Begg’s funnel plot. Twenty-three studies with 63 reports were included in our meta-analysis. These groups included 4 324 462 participants (27 231 colon cancer cases and 13 813 rectal cancer cases).

"Expression of miR-34 is lost in colon cancer which can be re-expressed by a novel agent CDF Background: Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Numerous cellular events, including deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), specifically the family of miR-34 consisting of miR-34a, b and c, is known to regulate the processes of growth and metastasis. Methods: We evaluated the expression of miR-34 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human colon cancer tissue specimens compared to normal colonic mucosa. Moreover, we also assessed the expression of miR-34 in colon cancer cell lines treated with our newly developed synthetic analogue of curcumin referred as difluorinated curcumin (CDF) compared to well known inhibitor of methyl transferase. Results: We found that the expression of miR-34a and miR-34c was down-regulated in colon cancer specimens compared to normal colonic mucosa and the loss of expression was also consistent with data from colon cancer cell lines. This down-regulation was attributed to promoter hypermethylation, because we found that the treatment of colon cancer cells with 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine, a methyltransferase inhibitor, markedly induced the levels of miR-34a and miR-34c expression. Likewise, CDF was very effective in the re-expression of miR-34a and miR-34c, which was consistent with inhibition of cell growth of both chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant colon cancer cells. The re-expression of miR-34 led to a marked reduction in the expression of its target gene, Notch-1. Conclusion: The loss of expression of miR-34 in colon cancer is in part due to promoter hypermethylation of miR-34, which can be re-expressed with our novel agent CDF, suggesting that CDF could be a novel demethylating agent for restoring the expression of miR-34 family, and thus CDF could become a newer therapeutic agent for the treatment of colon cancer.","expression of mir-34 is lost in colon cancer which can be re-expressed by a novel agent cdf background: colorectal cancer (crc) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. numerous cellular events, including deregulated expression of micrornas (mirnas), specifically the family of mir-34 consisting of mir-34a, b and c, is known to regulate the processes of growth and metastasis. methods: we evaluated the expression of mir-34 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) human colon cancer tissue specimens compared to normal colonic mucosa. moreover, we also assessed the expression of mir-34 in colon cancer cell lines treated with our newly developed synthetic analogue of curcumin referred as difluorinated curcumin (cdf) compared to well known inhibitor of methyl transferase. results: we found that the expression of mir-34a and mir-34c was down-regulated in colon cancer specimens compared to normal colonic mucosa and the loss of expression was also consistent with data from colon cancer",expression mir lose colon express novel agent cdf colorectal crc one leading cause death worldwide numerous cellular event include deregulated expression micrornas mirnas specifically family mir consisting mir b c know regulate process growth metastasis method evaluate expression mir formalin fix paraffin embed ffpe human colon tissue specimen compare normal colonic mucosa moreover also assess expression mir colon cell line treat newly develop synthetic analogue curcumin refer difluorinated curcumin cdf compare well know inhibitor methyl transferase result find expression mir mir c regulate colon specimen compare normal colonic mucosa loss expression also consistent data colon,a,Colon Cancer

"ERRα suppression enhances the cytotoxicity of the MEK inhibitor trametinib against colon cancer cells. ERRα, a constitutive transcription factor that regulates energy metabolism, plays an important role in the progression of various tumours. However, its role in cell survival and proliferation and its implication in targeted therapy in colon cancer remains elusive. The expression of ERRα in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. A wound healing assay and a transwell assay were performed to examine the migration and invasion of the colon cancer cells. A cell viability assay, clonogenic assay, western blot assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay were employed to study the interaction between trametinib (inhibitor of MEK) and EGF treatment. Flow cytometry, western blotting, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and xenograft studies were used to identify whether the combination of trametinib and simvastatin had a synergistic effect. ERRα positively regulated the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, and the suppression of ERRα completely reduced the EGF treatment-induced proliferation of colon cancer cells. Further investigation showed that trametinib partially restrained the up-regulation of ERRα induced by the EGF treatment, and ERRα inhibition increased the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to trametinib. At last, we combined trametinib with simvastatin, a common clinically used drug with a new reported function of transcriptional activity inhibition of ERRα, and found that this combination produced a synergistic effect in inhibiting the proliferation and survival of colon cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The present data indicated that ERRα acted as an oncogene in colon cancer cells, and the combined targeting of ERRα and MEK might be a promising therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment.","errα suppression enhances the cytotoxicity of the mek inhibitor trametinib against colon cancer cells. errα, a constitutive transcription factor that regulates energy metabolism, plays an important role in the progression of various tumours. however, its role in cell survival and proliferation and its implication in targeted therapy in colon cancer remains elusive. the expression of errα in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. a wound healing assay and a transwell assay were performed to examine the migration and invasion of the colon cancer cells. a cell viability assay, clonogenic assay, western blot assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay were employed to study the interaction between trametinib (inhibitor of mek) and egf treatment. flow cytometry, western blotting, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and xenograft studies were used to identify whether the combination of trametinib and simvastatin had a synergistic effect. errα positively regulated",err suppression enhance cytotoxicity mek inhibitor trametinib colon cell err constitutive transcription factor regulate energy metabolism play important role progression various however role cell survival proliferation implication targeted therapy colon remain elusive expression err colon tissue cell line detect use western blotting immunohistochemistry wound heal assay transwell assay perform examine migration invasion colon cell cell viability assay clonogenic assay western blot assay dual luciferase reporter assay employ interaction trametinib inhibitor mek egf flow cytometry western blot quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction xenograft use identify whether combination trametinib simvastatin synergistic effect err positively regulate,a,Colon Cancer
"Association of chemotherapy with survival in stage II colon cancer patients who received radical surgery: a retrospective cohort study. It remains controversial whether patients with Stage II colon cancer would benefit from chemotherapy after radical surgery. This study aims to assess the real effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with stage II colon cancer undergoing radical surgery and to construct survival prediction models to predict the survival benefits of chemotherapy. Data for stage II colon cancer patients with radical surgery were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed according to receive or not receive chemotherapy. Competitive risk regression models were used to assess colon cancer cause-specific death (CSD) and non-colon cancer cause-specific death (NCSD). Survival prediction nomograms were constructed to predict overall survival (OS) and colon cancer cause-specific survival (CSS). The predictive abilities of the constructed models were evaluated by the concordance indexes (C-indexes) and calibration curves. A total of 25,110 patients were identified, 21.7% received chemotherapy, and 78.3% were without chemotherapy. A total of 10,916 patients were extracted after propensity score matching. The estimated 3-year overall survival rates of chemotherapy were 0.7% higher than non- chemotherapy. The estimated 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates of non-chemotherapy were 1.3 and 2.1% higher than chemotherapy, respectively. Survival prediction models showed good discrimination (the C-indexes between 0.582 and 0.757) and excellent calibration. Chemotherapy improves the short-term (43 months) survival benefit of stage II colon cancer patients who received radical surgery. Survival prediction models can be used to predict OS and CSS of patients receiving chemotherapy as well as OS and CSS of patients not receiving chemotherapy and to make individualized treatment recommendations for stage II colon cancer patients who received radical surgery.","association of chemotherapy with survival in stage ii colon cancer patients who received radical surgery: a retrospective cohort study. it remains controversial whether patients with stage ii colon cancer would benefit from chemotherapy after radical surgery. this study aims to assess the real effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with stage ii colon cancer undergoing radical surgery and to construct survival prediction models to predict the survival benefits of chemotherapy. data for stage ii colon cancer patients with radical surgery were retrieved from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database. propensity score matching (1:1) was performed according to receive or not receive chemotherapy. competitive risk regression models were used to assess colon cancer cause-specific death (csd) and non-colon cancer cause-specific death (ncsd). survival prediction nomograms were constructed to predict overall survival (os) and colon cancer cause-specific survival (css). the predictive abilities of the constructed models were evaluated by the concordance",association chemotherapy survival stage ii colon receive radical surgery retrospective cohort remain controversial whether stage ii colon would benefit chemotherapy radical surgery assess real effectiveness chemotherapy stage ii colon undergo radical surgery construct survival prediction model predict survival benefit chemotherapy data stage ii colon radical surgery retrieve surveillance epidemiology end result seer database propensity score matching perform accord receive receive chemotherapy competitive risk regression model use assess colon cause specific death csd non colon cause specific death ncsd survival prediction nomogram construct predict overall survival colon cause specific survival css predictive ability constructed model evaluate concordance,a,Colon Cancer
"Overexpression of protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 facilitates tumor growth and indicates unfavorable prognosis of patients with colon cancer. Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) has been reported to play important role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. However, its role in colon cancer has not been studied. Here, we aimed to investigate the biological functions and potential mechanism of PRC1 in colon cancer. The expression level of PRC1 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a tissue microarray (TMA). Furthermore, colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480 were treated with short hairpin RNAs against PRC1. The biological function of PRC1 was determined by MTT proliferation, colony formation assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. Then, an in vivo tumor formation assay was conducted to explore the effects of PRC1 on tumor growth. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PRC1 were highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. PRC1 expression was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival of patients with colon cancer. Knockdown of PRC1 could decrease proliferation and colony forming ability of colon cancer cells, as well as arrested more cells at G2/M phase and promoted cell apoptosis. In cancer cells, the expression pattern of protein regulators included in cell cycle and apoptosis progress were reverted by PRC1 down-regulation. Additionally, PRC1 down-regulation could suppress colon tumor growth and differentiation. We confirmed that PRC1 was overexpressed in colon cancer and was associated with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients. PRC1 down-regulation could arrest cell cycle at G2/M stage, inhibit proliferation, and elicit apoptosis. These findings showed the potential of PRC1 to be used for therapeutic approaches in colon cancer.","overexpression of protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 facilitates tumor growth and indicates unfavorable prognosis of patients with colon cancer. protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (prc1) has been reported to play important role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. however, its role in colon cancer has not been studied. here, we aimed to investigate the biological functions and potential mechanism of prc1 in colon cancer. the expression level of prc1 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr), western blotting, and immunohistochemical (ihc) staining of a tissue microarray (tma). furthermore, colon cancer cell lines hct116 and sw480 were treated with short hairpin rnas against prc1. the biological function of prc1 was determined by mtt proliferation, colony formation assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. then, an in vivo tumor formation assay was conducted to explore the effects of prc1 on tumor growth. the mrna",overexpression protein regulator cytokinesis facilitates growth indicate unfavorable prognosis colon protein regulator cytokinesis prc report play important role pathogenesis various however role colon investigate biological function potential mechanism prc colon expression level prc colon tissue cell line detect quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr western blotting immunohistochemical ihc staining tissue microarray tma furthermore colon cell line hct sw treat short hairpin rna prc biological function prc determine mtt proliferation colony formation assay cell cycle apoptosis assay vivo formation assay conduct explore effect prc growth mrna,a,Colon Cancer

MTT assay, wound assay, Transwell and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of Bcl2 on miR-141-3p on colon cancer proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Compared with adjacent tissues, the expression of miR-141-3p in colon cancer tissues was significantly down-regulated. Colon cancer patients with low expression of miR-141-3p had poorer prognosis. Compared with normal colonic epithelial cells, miR-141-3p expression was significantly down-regulated in colon cancer cell lines, and overexpression of miR-141-3p significantly attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. Knockdown of miR-141-3p significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. miR-141-3p targets the negative regulation of Bcl2. Knockdown of Bcl2 significantly attenuated the promotion of miR-141-3p inhibitor on proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells and inhibition of apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl2 significantly enhanced the inhibition effect of miR-141-3p inhibitor on proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. In conclusion, miR-141-3p can inhibit the cancer by regulating Bcl2, and miR-141-3p has the potential to become a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.","study on effects of mir-141-3p in proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting bcl2 this study aimed to investigate the relationship between mir-141-3p and b lymphocyte-2 gene (bcl2) gene and its biological behavior on colon cancer cell line sw480. qrt-pcr was used to detect the expression level of mir-141-3p in colon cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, as well as in colon cancer cell line and normal human colonic epithelial cell line fhc. mtt assay, wound assay, and transwell demonstrated the effects of mir-141-3p on colon cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. targetscan7.1 predictive software and dual luciferase reporter assays were used to detect the targeted regulation of mir-141-3p on the apoptosis-related gene bcl2. mtt assay, wound assay, transwell and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of bcl2 on mir-141-3p on colon cancer proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. compared with adjacent tissues, the expression of mir-141-3p",effect mir p proliferation migration invasion apoptosis colon cell inhibit bcl investigate relationship mir p b lymphocyte gene bcl gene biological behavior colon cell line sw qrt pcr use detect expression level mir p colon tissue adjacent tissue well colon cell line normal human colonic epithelial cell line fhc mtt assay wound assay transwell demonstrate effect mir p colon proliferation migration invasion targetscan predictive software dual luciferase reporter assay use detect targeted regulation mir p apoptosis relate gene bcl mtt assay wound assay transwell flow cytometry use detect effect bcl mir p colon proliferation migration invasion apoptosis compare adjacent tissue expression mir p,a,Colon Cancer
"Curcumin inhibits human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of epidermal growth factor receptor through reducing the activity of the transcription factor Egr-1. High expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is found in a variety of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. EGFR has been identified as a rational target for anticancer therapy. Curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. We recently reported that curcumin inhibited the growth of human colon cancer-derived Moser cells by suppressing gene expression of cyclinD1 and EGFR. The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin inhibition of gene expression of EGFR in colon cancer cells. The generality of the inhibitory effect of curcumin on gene expression of EGFR was verified in other human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Promoter deletion assays and site-directed mutageneses identified a binding site for the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in egfr promoter as a putative curcumin response element in regulating the promoter activity of the gene in Moser cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that curcumin significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor Egr-1 to the curcumin response element. In addition, curcumin reduced the trans-activation activity of Egr-1 by suppressing egr-1 gene expression, which required interruption of the ERK signal pathway and reduction of the level of phosphorylation of Elk-1 and its activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that curcumin inhibited human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of EGFR through reducing the trans-activation activity of Egr-1. These results provided novel insights into the mechanisms of curcumin inhibition of colon cancer cell growth and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of colon cancer.","curcumin inhibits human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of epidermal growth factor receptor through reducing the activity of the transcription factor egr-1. high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) is found in a variety of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. egfr has been identified as a rational target for anticancer therapy. curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. we recently reported that curcumin inhibited the growth of human colon cancer-derived moser cells by suppressing gene expression of cyclind1 and egfr. the aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin inhibition of gene expression of egfr in colon cancer cells. the generality of the inhibitory effect of curcumin on gene expression of egfr was verified in other human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including caco-2 and ht-29 cells. promoter",curcumin inhibits human colon cell growth suppress gene expression epidermal growth factor receptor reduce activity transcription factor egr high expression epidermal growth factor receptor egfr find variety solid include colorectal egfr identify rational target anticancer therapy curcumin yellow pigment turmeric curry receive attention promising dietary supplement prevention recently report curcumin inhibit growth human colon derive moser cell suppress gene expression cyclind egfr present explore molecular mechanism underlie curcumin inhibition gene expression egfr colon cell generality inhibitory effect curcumin gene expression egfr verify human colon derive cell line include caco ht cell promoter,a,Colon Cancer
"Prognostic impact of primary tumor location in Stage III colorectal cancer-right-sided colon versus left-sided colon versus rectum: a nationwide multicenter retrospective study Previous studies investigating the impact of tumor location on colorectal cancer prognosis only compared two groups by location, e.g., ‘right-sided colon vs. left-sided colon,’ ‘colon vs. rectum,’ and ‘right-sided (right-sided colon) vs. left-sided (left-sided colon and rectum).’ This nationwide multicenter retrospective study aimed to clarify the prognostic impact of tumor location in patients with stage III colorectal cancer by classifying tumors into three groups: right-sided colon, left-sided colon, and rectum. Subjects were 9194 patients with stage III colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgery from 1997 to 2012. Relapse-free survival (RFS) after primary surgery and overall survival (OS) after recurrence were examined.;  Rectal cancer (n = 2922) was associated with worse RFS compared to right-sided colon cancer (n = 2362) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.65; 95% CI 0.59–0.72; p < 0.001) and left-sided colon cancer (n = 3910) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.66–0.78; p < 0.001) after adjusting for key clinical factors (i.e., sex, age, histological type, CEA, adjuvant therapy, T category, and N category). Among patients with recurrence (n = 2823), rectal cancer was associated with better OS compared to right-sided colon cancer (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.08–1.40; p = 0.002) and worse OS compared to left-sided colon cancer (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79–0.99; p = 0.029). Twenty percent of right-sided colon cancer recurrences exhibited peritoneal dissemination, 42% of left-sided colon cancer recurrences were liver metastases, and 33% of rectal cancer recurrences were local recurrences. The three tumor locations (right-sided colon, left-sided colon, rectum) had different prognostic implications for recurrence after curative resection and overall mortality, suggesting that tumor location serves as a prognostic biomarker in stage III colorectal cancer.","prognostic impact of primary tumor location in stage iii colorectal cancer-right-sided colon versus left-sided colon versus rectum: a nationwide multicenter retrospective study previous studies investigating the impact of tumor location on colorectal cancer prognosis only compared two groups by location, e.g., ‘right-sided colon vs. left-sided colon,’ ‘colon vs. rectum,’ and ‘right-sided (right-sided colon) vs. left-sided (left-sided colon and rectum).’ this nationwide multicenter retrospective study aimed to clarify the prognostic impact of tumor location in patients with stage iii colorectal cancer by classifying tumors into three groups: right-sided colon, left-sided colon, and rectum. subjects were 9194 patients with stage iii colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgery from 1997 to 2012. relapse-free survival (rfs) after primary surgery and overall survival (os) after recurrence were examined.; rectal cancer (n = 2922) was associated with worse rfs compared to right-sided colon cancer (n = 2362) (hazard ratio (hr) 0.65; 95% ci 0.59–0.72; p <",prognostic impact primary location stage iii colorectal right side colon versus leave sided colon versus rectum nationwide multicenter retrospective previous investigate impact location colorectal prognosis compare two group location e g right side colon v leave sided colon colon v rectum right side right side colon v leave sided left side colon rectum nationwide multicenter retrospective clarify prognostic impact location stage iii colorectal classify three group right side colon left side colon rectum subject stage iii colorectal undergo curative surgery relapse free survival rf primary surgery overall survival recurrence examine rectal n associate bad rf compare right sided colon n hazard ratio hr ci p,a,Colon Cancer
"Oncological outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic versus open lateral lymph node dissection for locally advanced low rectal cancer The long-term outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection (RALLD) have not been fully investigated. This study aimed to assess the oncological and long-term outcomes of RALLD for rectal cancer through comparison with those of open lateral lymph node dissection (OLLD) in a retrospective study. Between September 2002 and October 2014, the medical data of 426 patients who underwent total mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection for primary rectal cancer were collected. Of these, 115 patients were excluded after data collection (stage IV, n = 61; total pelvic exenteration, n = 31; multiple cancer, n = 20; conventional laparoscopic surgery, n = 3). Before matching, 311 patients with clinical stage II/III were analyzed. Using exact matching, patients were stratified into RALLD (n = 78) and OLLD (n = 78) groups. Pathological findings and long-term outcomes were compared between the groups. The pathological stage and number of harvested lymph nodes showed no significant differences between the groups. The rate of positive resection margin in the RALLD group tended to be lower compared with that of the OLLD group (p = 0.059). The median follow-up duration was 54.0 months in 156 patients. The 5-year overall survival rate was 95.4 and 87.8% in the RALLD and OLLD groups, respectively (p = 0.106). The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 79.1 and 69.9% in the RALLD and OLLD groups, respectively (p = 0.157). The 5-year local relapse-free survival rate was 98.6 and 90.9% in the RALLD and OLLD groups, respectively (p = 0.029).

"Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 regulates PTEN expression and is associated with the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells via PI3k/Akt signaling Stromal-derived CXCL12 play an important role which influence the proliferation and invasiveness of colon cancer in microenvironment. The present study aimed to analyze the underlying mechanism by which CXCL12 and tumour suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) influences the metastatic potential of colon cancer and internal relation of colon cancer and stromal cells. RT-PCR and western blot were detected the expression of CXCL12, CXCR4 and PTEN in colon cancer cells and stromal cells. The co-operative effects of CXCL12 and PTEN on proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells were evaluated by real-time PCR, proliferation and invasion assays using an in vitro system consisting of co-cultured cancer cells and stromal cells. We eventually investigated activation of PI3K/Akt signaling by CXCL12 regulate PTEN and involved in the metastatic process of colon cancer. In addition, we also examine how the knockdown of PTEN influences proliferation and invasion and correlate with CXCL12/CXCR4/PI3K/Akt, determination of PTEN up-down-stream targets that preferentially contribute to tumorigenesis. Blockage of PTEN phosphorylation led to a stronger enhancement of cell proliferation and invasion upon stimulation with CXCL12 via its activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN by siRNA transfection was also found to enhance the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby promoting cell invasion and proliferation. CXCL12 induced transcriptional down-regulation of activated PTEN and this signaling pathway promotes cell survival. CXCL12/CXCR4/PI3K/Akt cascade may be critical for colon cancer cells to metastasize. Based on our results, we suggest that the modification of CXCR4, PTEN, or PI3K function might be promising new therapeutic approaches to inhibit the aggressive spread of colon cancer.","fibroblast-derived cxcl12 regulates pten expression and is associated with the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells via pi3k/akt signaling stromal-derived cxcl12 play an important role which influence the proliferation and invasiveness of colon cancer in microenvironment. the present study aimed to analyze the underlying mechanism by which cxcl12 and tumour suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (pten) influences the metastatic potential of colon cancer and internal relation of colon cancer and stromal cells. rt-pcr and western blot were detected the expression of cxcl12, cxcr4 and pten in colon cancer cells and stromal cells. the co-operative effects of cxcl12 and pten on proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells were evaluated by real-time pcr, proliferation and invasion assays using an in vitro system consisting of co-cultured cancer cells and stromal cells. we eventually investigated activation of pi3k/akt signaling by cxcl12 regulate pten and involved in the",fibroblast derive cxcl regulates pten expression associate proliferation invasion colon cell via pi k akt signal stromal derive cxcl play important role influence proliferation invasiveness colon microenvironment present analyze underlie mechanism cxcl suppressor protein phosphatase tensin homologue delete chromosome pten influence metastatic potential colon internal relation colon stromal cell rt pcr western blot detect expression cxcl cxcr pten colon cell stromal cell co operative effect cxcl pten proliferation invasion colon cell evaluate real time pcr proliferation invasion assay use vitro system consist co culture cell stromal cell eventually investigate activation pi k akt signal cxcl regulate pten involve,a,Colon Cancer
"Exploring mechanisms of diet-colon cancer associations through candidate molecular interaction networks Background: Epidemiological studies in the recent years have investigated the relationship between dietary habits and disease risk demonstrating that diet has a direct effect on public health. Especially plant-based diets -fruits, vegetables and herbs- are known as a source of molecules with pharmacological properties for treatment of several malignancies. Unquestionably, for developing specific intervention strategies to reduce cancer risk there is a need for a more extensive and holistic examination of the dietary components for exploring the mechanisms of action and understanding the nutrient-nutrient interactions. Here, we used colon cancer as a proof-of-concept for understanding key regulatory sites of diet on the disease pathway. Results: We started from a unique vantage point by having a database of 158 plants positively associated to colon cancer reduction and their molecular composition (~3,500 unique compounds). We generated a comprehensive picture of the interaction profile of these edible and non-edible plants with a predefined candidate colon cancer target space consisting of ~1,900 proteins. This knowledge allowed us to study systematically the key components in colon cancer that are targeted synergistically by phytochemicals and identify statistically significant and highly correlated protein networks that could be perturbed by dietary habits. Conclusion: We propose here a framework for interrogating the critical targets in colon cancer processes and identifying plant-based dietary interventions as important modifiers using a systems chemical biology approach. Our methodology for better delineating prevention of colon cancer by nutritional interventions relies heavily on the availability of information about the small molecule constituents of our diet and it can be expanded to any other disease class that previous evidence has linked to lifestyle.","exploring mechanisms of diet-colon cancer associations through candidate molecular interaction networks background: epidemiological studies in the recent years have investigated the relationship between dietary habits and disease risk demonstrating that diet has a direct effect on public health. especially plant-based diets -fruits, vegetables and herbs- are known as a source of molecules with pharmacological properties for treatment of several malignancies. unquestionably, for developing specific intervention strategies to reduce cancer risk there is a need for a more extensive and holistic examination of the dietary components for exploring the mechanisms of action and understanding the nutrient-nutrient interactions. here, we used colon cancer as a proof-of-concept for understanding key regulatory sites of diet on the disease pathway. results: we started from a unique vantage point by having a database of 158 plants positively associated to colon cancer reduction and their molecular composition (~3,500 unique compounds). we generated a comprehensive picture of the",explore mechanism diet colon association candidate molecular interaction network epidemiological recent year investigate relationship dietary habit risk demonstrate diet direct effect public health especially plant base diet fruit vegetable herb know source molecule pharmacological property several malignancy unquestionably develop specific intervention strategy reduce risk need extensive holistic examination dietary component explore mechanism action understand nutrient nutrient interaction use colon proof concept understand key regulatory site diet pathway result start unique vantage point database plant positively associate colon reduction molecular composition unique compound generate comprehensive picture,a,Colon Cancer

"Extra-luminal detection of assumed colonic tumor site by near-infrared laparoscopy. Localization of colorectal tumors during laparoscopic surgery is generally performed by tattooing into the submucosal layer of the colon. However, faint and diffuse tattoos may lead to difficulties in recognizing cancer sites, resulting in inappropriate resection of the colon. We previously demonstrated that yttrium oxide nanoparticles doped with the rare earth ions (ytterbium and erbium) (YNP) showed strong near-infrared (NIR) emission under NIR excitation (1550 nm emission with 980 nm excitation). NIR light can penetrate deep tissues. In this study, we developed an NIR laparoscopy imaging system and demonstrated its use for accurate resection of the colon in swine. The NIR laparoscopy system consisted of an NIR laparoscope, NIR excitation laser diode, and an NIR camera. Endo-clips coated with YNP (NIR clip), silicon rubber including YNP (NIR silicon mass), and YNP solution (NIR ink) were prepared as test NIR markers. We used a swine model to detect an assumed colon cancer site using NIR laparoscopy, followed by laparoscopic resection. The NIR markers were fixed at an assumed cancer site within the colon by endoscopy. An NIR laparoscope was then introduced into the abdominal cavity through a laparoscopy port. NIR emission from the markers in the swine colon was successfully recognized using the NIR laparoscopy imaging system. The position of the markers in the colon could be identified. Accurate resection of the colon was performed successfully by laparoscopic surgery under NIR fluorescence guidance. The presence of the NIR markers within the extirpated colon was confirmed, indicating resection of the appropriate site. NIR laparoscopic surgery is useful for colorectal cancer site recognition and accurate resection using laparoscopic surgery.","extra-luminal detection of assumed colonic tumor site by near-infrared laparoscopy. localization of colorectal tumors during laparoscopic surgery is generally performed by tattooing into the submucosal layer of the colon. however, faint and diffuse tattoos may lead to difficulties in recognizing cancer sites, resulting in inappropriate resection of the colon. we previously demonstrated that yttrium oxide nanoparticles doped with the rare earth ions (ytterbium and erbium) (ynp) showed strong near-infrared (nir) emission under nir excitation (1550 nm emission with 980 nm excitation). nir light can penetrate deep tissues. in this study, we developed an nir laparoscopy imaging system and demonstrated its use for accurate resection of the colon in swine. the nir laparoscopy system consisted of an nir laparoscope, nir excitation laser diode, and an nir camera. endo-clips coated with ynp (nir clip), silicon rubber including ynp (nir silicon mass), and ynp solution (nir ink) were prepared as test nir markers.",extra luminal detection assumed colonic site near infrared laparoscopy localization colorectal laparoscopic surgery generally perform tattoo submucosal layer colon however faint diffuse tattoo may lead difficulty recognize site result inappropriate resection colon previously demonstrate yttrium oxide nanoparticles dope rare earth ion ytterbium erbium ynp show strong near infrared nir emission nir excitation nm emission nm excitation nir light penetrate deep tissue develop nir laparoscopy image system demonstrate use accurate resection colon swine nir laparoscopy system consist nir laparoscope nir excitation laser diode nir camera endo clip coat ynp nir clip silicon rubber include ynp nir silicon mass ynp solution nir ink prepare test nir marker,a,Colon Cancer
"Proportion of colon cancer attributable to lifestyle in a cohort of US women Many modifiable lifestyle factors have been associated with colon cancer risk, but less is known about their effect on disease when considered together. Estimating the proportion of colon cancer cases that could be prevented by the adoption of combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors will provide important insights into disease prevention. In the Nurses’ Health Study, we defined a low-risk group according to a combination of six factors: body mass index <25 kg/m2, physical activity of ≥21 metabolic equivalent of task per week, alcohol consumption ≤30 g/day, cigarette smoking <10 pack-years before the age of 30, current use of multivitamins for ≥15 years, and total calcium intake ≥700 mg/day. A composite risk score index was created and the population attributable risk (PAR%) was calculated after accounting for other known risk or protective factors. We documented 1,127 colon cancer cases among 81,092 over 24 years of follow-up. Compared with women in the lowest risk category, the women at all other exposure levels had a hazard ratio of colon cancer of 1.81 (95 % confidence interval 1.15–2.85). The score index was significantly and linearly related to an increasing risk of colon cancer (p value for trend <0.0001). The PAR% of the six risk factors considered together in relation to colon cancer was 0.37 (95 % CI 0.09–0.60). When regular aspirin use (two tablets/week for six or more years) was included with the other low-risk behaviors, the PAR% increased to 0.43 (95 % CI 0.14–0.65). Beyond the known benefit from colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, key behavior modifications and adherence to a healthy lifestyle could avoid approximately 37 % of colon cancer cases among women.","proportion of colon cancer attributable to lifestyle in a cohort of us women many modifiable lifestyle factors have been associated with colon cancer risk, but less is known about their effect on disease when considered together. estimating the proportion of colon cancer cases that could be prevented by the adoption of combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors will provide important insights into disease prevention. in the nurses’ health study, we defined a low-risk group according to a combination of six factors: body mass index <25 kg/m2, physical activity of ≥21 metabolic equivalent of task per week, alcohol consumption ≤30 g/day, cigarette smoking <10 pack-years before the age of 30, current use of multivitamins for ≥15 years, and total calcium intake ≥700 mg/day. a composite risk score index was created and the population attributable risk (par%) was calculated after accounting for other known risk or protective factors. we documented 1,127 colon cancer cases",proportion colon attributable lifestyle cohort u woman many modifiable lifestyle factor associate colon risk less know effect consider together estimate proportion colon could prevent adoption combine modifiable lifestyle behavior provide important insight prevention nurse health define low risk group accord combination six factor body mass index kg physical activity metabolic equivalent task per week alcohol consumption g day cigarette smoke pack year age current use multivitamin year total calcium intake mg day composite risk score index create population attributable risk par calculate account know risk protective factor document colon,a,Colon Cancer
"Comparison of Characteristics and Inpatient Outcomes of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colon Cancer: A Propensity-Based Nationwide Inpatient Sample Study. Introduction Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) frequently develop colon cancer. Previous studies have identified the association between IBD and colon cancer. In this study, we explored the characteristics and outcomes of IBD patients with colon cancer admitted to the hospitals of the United States. Methods Patients who were hospitalized patients with diagnoses of IBD and colon cancer were compared with patients with IBD without colon cancer. The data were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from January 2016 to December 2017. Comparisons were made with regards to mortality, complications, in-hospital stay, and cost of treatment between the two groups. Results We identified 1,82,025 hospitalizations from January 2016 to December 2017 admitted with a diagnosis of IBD. Of these, 181,560 patients had IBD without colon cancer, and 465 patients had IBD with colon cancer. No statistically significant difference was observed with regards to the in-hospital mortality between the two groups. There were higher odds of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 1.54, 95% CI 6.6-9.8; p=0.00), colectomy (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.3-2.5; p=0.0) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.7; p=0.04) in patients with IBD and colon cancer. A longer length of stay (7.1±6.9 vs.5.0±5.6, p=0.00) and higher mean total charge ($20,283 vs. $12,166, p=0.00) were observed in patients with IBD with colon cancer. Conclusions Patients with IBD-associated colon cancer appear to have higher complication rates, higher costs, and more extended hospital stays. Therefore, early identification and management of complications related to IBD among patients with colon cancer are particularly crucial to reduce morbidity as well as the cost of hospitalization and treatment.","comparison of characteristics and inpatient outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer: a propensity-based nationwide inpatient sample study. introduction patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) frequently develop colon cancer. previous studies have identified the association between ibd and colon cancer. in this study, we explored the characteristics and outcomes of ibd patients with colon cancer admitted to the hospitals of the united states. methods patients who were hospitalized patients with diagnoses of ibd and colon cancer were compared with patients with ibd without colon cancer. the data were extracted from the nationwide inpatient sample (nis) from january 2016 to december 2017. comparisons were made with regards to mortality, complications, in-hospital stay, and cost of treatment between the two groups. results we identified 1,82,025 hospitalizations from january 2016 to december 2017 admitted with a diagnosis of ibd. of these, 181,560 patients had ibd without colon cancer, and 465",comparison characteristic inpatient outcome inflammatory bowel colon propensity base nationwide inpatient sample inflammatory bowel ibds frequently develop colon previous identify association ibd colon explore characteristic outcome ibd colon admit hospital united state method hospitalize diagnosis ibd colon compare ibd without colon data extract nationwide inpatient sample ni january december comparison make regard mortality complication hospital stay cost two group result identify hospitalization january december admit diagnosis ibd ibd without colon,a,Colon Cancer
"Aspirin inhibited the metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of toll-like receptor 4 The metastasis of colorectal cancer frequently tends to liver, which is one of the three leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Growing evidence showed that aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. However, the potential mechanism has not been fully understood. Mouse splenic vein metastasis assay was used to examine the metastatic ability of colon cancer cells in vivo. And wound healing and transwell assay were applied to detect the metastasis potential of C26 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines in vitro. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to explore Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in colon cancer cell lines. The functions of TLR4 in the migration of the colon cancer cell line were analyzed by infecting cells with lentivirus containing TLR4 siRNA. We demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) could enhance the metastasis potential of C26 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines. However, aspirin effectively decreased the metastasis capacity of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that the enhancement of LPS on the migration of colon cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype demonstrated a TLR4-dependent manner. Aspirin treatment lead to the downregulation of TLR4 on C26 cells which resulted in the decrease of C26 cells migration and EMT phenotype that induced by LPS. Additionally, the inhibitory effect from aspirin on the expression of TLR4 on C26 cells leads to the downregulation of NF-κB. The results of our study indicate that LPS origin from intestinal flora may promote the metastasis of colon cancer to liver and aspirin may inhibit the metastasis of colon cancer by inhibiting the expression of TLR4.","aspirin inhibited the metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of toll-like receptor 4 the metastasis of colorectal cancer frequently tends to liver, which is one of the three leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. growing evidence showed that aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. however, the potential mechanism has not been fully understood. mouse splenic vein metastasis assay was used to examine the metastatic ability of colon cancer cells in vivo. and wound healing and transwell assay were applied to detect the metastasis potential of c26 and hct116 colon cancer cell lines in vitro. rt-pcr and western blotting were used to explore toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) expression in colon cancer cell lines. the functions of tlr4 in the migration of the colon cancer cell line were analyzed by infecting cells with lentivirus containing tlr4 sirna. we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides (lps) could enhance the metastasis",aspirin inhibit metastasis colon cell inhibit expression toll like receptor metastasis colorectal frequently tend liver one three lead cause relate death worldwide grow evidence show aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis colorectal however potential mechanism fully understood mouse splenic vein metastasis assay use examine metastatic ability colon cell vivo wound healing transwell assay apply detect metastasis potential c hct colon cell line vitro rt pcr western blotting use explore toll like receptor tlr expression colon cell line function tlr migration colon cell line analyze infect cell lentivirus contain tlr sirna demonstrate lipopolysaccharides lp could enhance metastasis,a,Colon Cancer

"MicroRNA miR-29a Inhibits Colon Cancer Progression by Downregulating B7-H3 Expression: Potential Molecular Targets for Colon Cancer Therapy. MiR-29a belongs to one of the subtypes of miRNAs known as non-coding single-stranded RNAs and is preferentially expressed in normal tissues. B7-H3, a member of the B7/CD28 immunoglobulin superfamily, was shown to be overexpressed in several solid malignant tumors, including colon cancer. In addition, it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. We used immunohistochemical and Western blotting to assess B7-H3 protein expression levels in colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues and then compared their relationships with clinicopathological factors. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used to assess B7-H3 and miRNA-29a mRNA expression levels, and then their relationship and clinical significance were evaluated. In addition, colon cancer Caco-2 cells, which constitutively overexpress B7-H3, were transfected with lentivirus particles for miR-29a upregulation. Invasion and migration assays were carried out in vitro along with the establishment of a subcutaneous xenograft model in vivo to determine the role of miRNA-29a in colon cancer progression. The B7-H3 protein showed elevated expression in colon carcinoma and was relevant to TNM staging, lymph node metastasis, and reduced survival. Meanwhile, miR-29a was preferentially expressed in normal colon tissues, while B7-H3 transcript levels had no marked differences between tumor and normal tissue specimens. In vitro, miR-29a upregulation resulted in reduced B7-H3 expression. Furthermore, miR-29a upregulation reduced the invasive and migratory abilities of colon carcinoma cells. In animal models, upregulation of miR-29a slowed down the growth of subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumors and resulted in prolonged survival time. MiR-29a downregulates B7-H3 expression and accordingly inhibits colon cancer progression, invasion, and migration, indicating miR-29a and B7-H3 might represent novel molecular targets for advanced immunotherapy in colon cancer.","microrna mir-29a inhibits colon cancer progression by downregulating b7-h3 expression: potential molecular targets for colon cancer therapy. mir-29a belongs to one of the subtypes of mirnas known as non-coding single-stranded rnas and is preferentially expressed in normal tissues. b7-h3, a member of the b7/cd28 immunoglobulin superfamily, was shown to be overexpressed in several solid malignant tumors, including colon cancer. in addition, it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. we used immunohistochemical and western blotting to assess b7-h3 protein expression levels in colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues and then compared their relationships with clinicopathological factors. quantitative real-time reverse-transcription pcr was used to assess b7-h3 and mirna-29a mrna expression levels, and then their relationship and clinical significance were evaluated. in addition, colon cancer caco-2 cells, which constitutively overexpress b7-h3, were transfected with lentivirus particles for mir-29a upregulation. invasion and migration assays were carried out in vitro along with the",microrna mir inhibits colon progression downregulating b h expression potential molecular target colon therapy mir belongs one subtypes mirnas know non cod single strand rna preferentially express normal tissue b h member b cd immunoglobulin superfamily show overexpressed several solid malignant include colon addition associate progression poor prognosis use immunohistochemical western blotting assess b h protein expression level colon adjacent normal tissue compare relationship clinicopathological factor quantitative real time reverse transcription pcr use assess b h mirna mrna expression level relationship significance evaluate addition colon caco cell constitutively overexpress b h transfected lentivirus particle mir upregulation invasion migration assay carry vitro along,a,Colon Cancer
"Carcinoma obstruction of the proximal colon cancer and long-term prognosis—obstruction is a predictor of worse outcome in TNM stage II tumor Colon obstruction is suggested to be a predictor of poor outcome in colon cancer. However, the effect of obstruction on outcome in patients with different tumor–nodes–metastases (TNM) stage cancer has not been fully addressed. The aim of this study is to determine whether colon obstruction predicts surgical and long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with proximal colon cancer. A total of 1,492 consecutive patients underwent open resection of primary adenocarcinoma of right colon in a single institution between January 1995 and December 2005. Clinical and follow-up data were extracted from a prospective colorectal cancer database. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify colon obstruction and other predictors of surgical and oncologic outcomes. Among 1,492 patients, 306 (20.5%) patients presented with colon obstruction. The rates of surgical morbidity and mortality were greater in patients with an obstruction as compared to patients without an obstruction (22.2% and 3.9% vs. 14.1% and 1.9%; p = 0.0005 and 0.041, respectively). Obstruction predicted a worse long-term disease-free survival (DFS) among patients with stage II–III disease (log-rank test, p = 0.0003). The data were stratified by TNM stage. Obstruction predicted a worse DFS among patients with TNM stage II cancer (598 patients; log-rank test, p = 0.001; Cox regression, p = 0.012), but it was not a predictor in TNM stage III cancer patients (424 patients; p = 0.116; p = 0.108). Colon obstruction was an independent predictor of long-term outcome only in TNM stage II but not in stage III proximal colon cancer.

"Postoperative intra-abdominal infection is an independent prognostic factor of disease-free survival and disease-specific survival in patients with stage II colon cancer Recurrence occurs in up to 20% of patients with stage II colon cancer operated on for cure. Although postoperative intra-abdominal infection has been linked with an increased risk of recurrence, the association is controversial. The aim was to investigate the impact of postoperative intra-abdominal infection on disease-free survival and disease-specific survival in patients with stage II colon cancer. Patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer stage II, between 2003 and 2014, were included. Patients with anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess were included in the infection group. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to represent the distribution of survival and the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the contribution of relevant clinicopathological factors with prognosis. Postoperative intra-abdominal infection was diagnosed in 37 of 363 (10.2%) patients. Perioperative blood transfusion was more frequent in patients with infection (p = 0.008). Overall 5-year disease-free survival rate was 85.1%.

"High expression of TCN1 is a negative prognostic biomarker and can predict neoadjuvant chemosensitivity of colon cancer. Transcobalamin (TCN1) is a vitamin B12 (cobalamin)-binding protein that regulates cobalamin homeostasis. Recent studies and bioinformatic analyses have found that TCN1 is highly expressed in cancer tissues and is associated with tumour aggressiveness and poor prognosis. The present study aimed to detect TCN1 as a novel biomarker for prognosis and chemosensitivity of colon cancer. Next-generation sequencing showed that TCN1 was one of several upregulated mRNAs in colon cancer, which was verified by further bioinformatics analyses. Western blotting (n = 9) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR, n = 30) revealed that TCN1 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues at both the protein and mRNA level. A total of 194 cases of colon cancer were examined by immunohistochemistry and revealed that TCN1 expression level was related to advanced stages (P < 0.005). Kaplan–Meier analysis verified that patients with lower TCN1 expression usually had longer overall survival (P = 0.008). In addition, TCN1 was highly expressed in pulmonary metastatic tumour tissues (n = 37, P = 0.025) and exhibited higher levels in right-sided colon cancer than in left-sided colon cancer (P = 0.029). TCN1 expression in specimens that had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased compared with that in colonoscopy biopsy tissues (n = 42, P = 0.009). Further bioinformatics analyses verified that apoptosis pathways might have a role in high TCN1 expression. All the studies revealed that TCN1 expression in colon cancer was significantly associated with malignant biological behaviour. Therefore, TCN1 could be used as a novel biomarker for colon cancer aggressiveness and prognosis and might also be a potential biomarker for predicting neoadjuvant chemosensitivity.","high expression of tcn1 is a negative prognostic biomarker and can predict neoadjuvant chemosensitivity of colon cancer. transcobalamin (tcn1) is a vitamin b12 (cobalamin)-binding protein that regulates cobalamin homeostasis. recent studies and bioinformatic analyses have found that tcn1 is highly expressed in cancer tissues and is associated with tumour aggressiveness and poor prognosis. the present study aimed to detect tcn1 as a novel biomarker for prognosis and chemosensitivity of colon cancer. next-generation sequencing showed that tcn1 was one of several upregulated mrnas in colon cancer, which was verified by further bioinformatics analyses. western blotting (n = 9) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr, n = 30) revealed that tcn1 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues at both the protein and mrna level. a total of 194 cases of colon cancer were examined by immunohistochemistry and revealed that tcn1 expression level was related to advanced stages (p <",high expression tcn negative prognostic biomarker predict neoadjuvant chemosensitivity colon transcobalamin tcn vitamin b cobalamin bind protein regulate cobalamin homeostasis recent bioinformatic find tcn highly express tissue associate aggressiveness poor prognosis present detect tcn novel biomarker prognosis chemosensitivity colon next generation sequence show tcn one several upregulated mrna colon verify bioinformatics analyse western blot n quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr n reveal tcn highly express colon tissue protein mrna level total colon examine immunohistochemistry reveal tcn expression level relate advanced stage p,a,Colon Cancer
"Inhibition of haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer in mice by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, JTE-522. It is proposed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce colorectal tumorigenesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and two isoforms of COX have been characterized, COX-1 and COX-2. Multiple studies have shown that COX-2 is expressed at high levels in colorectal tumours and play a role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Recently it has been reported that selective inhibition of COX-2 inhibits colon cancer cell growth. In this study we investigated the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (JTE-522) on haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer. For this purpose, we selected a murine colon cancer cell line, colon-26, that constitutively expresses the COX-2 protein. The subclone P expressed a high level of COX-2 and the subclone 5 expressed a low level. The colon-26 subclones were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c mice. JTE-522 was given intraperitoneally every day from the day prior to cancer cell injection, and the mice were sacrificed 16 days after cell injection. Lung metastases were compared between groups with and without JTE-522. In the mice injected with subclone P, the number of lung metastatic nodules was significantly reduced in the treated group. However, in the mice injected with subclone 5, there was little difference between the control and the treated groups. These results indicate that there may be a direct link between inhibition of haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer and selective inhibition of COX-2, and that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be a novel class of therapeutic agents not only for colorectal tumorigenesis but also for haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer.","inhibition of haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer in mice by a selective cox-2 inhibitor, jte-522. it is proposed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) reduce colorectal tumorigenesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox). cox is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and two isoforms of cox have been characterized, cox-1 and cox-2. multiple studies have shown that cox-2 is expressed at high levels in colorectal tumours and play a role in colorectal tumorigenesis. recently it has been reported that selective inhibition of cox-2 inhibits colon cancer cell growth. in this study we investigated the effect of a selective cox-2 inhibitor (jte-522) on haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer. for this purpose, we selected a murine colon cancer cell line, colon-26, that constitutively expresses the cox-2 protein. the subclone p expressed a high level of cox-2 and the subclone 5 expressed a low level. the colon-26 subclones were injected",inhibition haematogenous metastasis colon mouse selective cox inhibitor jte propose non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid reduce colorectal tumorigenesis inhibition cyclooxygenase cox cox key enzyme conversion arachidonic acid prostaglandin two isoforms cox characterize cox cox multiple show cox express high level colorectal play role colorectal tumorigenesis recently report selective inhibition cox inhibits colon cell growth investigate effect selective cox inhibitor jte haematogenous metastasis colon select murine colon cell line colon constitutively express cox protein subclone p express high level cox subclone express low level colon subclones inject,a,Colon Cancer

"Carcinoma of the splenic flexure: multivariate analysis of predictive factors for clinicopathological characteristics and outcome after surgery. The clinicopathological characteristics and outcome of splenic flexure cancer after surgery have yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to establish predictive factors related to splenic flexure cancer and outcome after surgery. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and outcome of 34 patients with splenic flexure cancers (which represents 3.7% of the total number of colon cancers in our series) with those of 418 patients with right colon and 475 patients with left colon cancers by univariate and multivariate analyses, using logistic regression analysis and Cox's proportional hazards model. Splenic flexure cancers had a high risk of obstruction (26.5% of patients), and had a more advanced stage and lower cure rate than left colon cancers. Logistic regression analysis revealed that two independent factors, colonic obstruction and the presence of distant metastases, were related to the splenic flexure tumor site. Splenic flexure cancer patients had a poorer outcome than those with left colon cancer (P = 0.0361). However, there was no difference in survival between patients with splenic flexure, those with right colon cancer and those with left colon cancer who underwent curative surgery. Cox's regression analysis revealed that neither the site of splenic flexure nor colonic obstruction was an independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, splenic flexure cancer is characterized by a high risk of obstruction and the presence of distant metastases. However, after curative resection, splenic flexure cancer has a similar outcome to colon cancer at other sites. In addition, neither the splenic flexure site nor colonic obstruction had an independent influence on patient survival after surgery.","carcinoma of the splenic flexure: multivariate analysis of predictive factors for clinicopathological characteristics and outcome after surgery. the clinicopathological characteristics and outcome of splenic flexure cancer after surgery have yet to be fully elucidated. the aim of the current study was, therefore, to establish predictive factors related to splenic flexure cancer and outcome after surgery. we compared the clinicopathological characteristics and outcome of 34 patients with splenic flexure cancers (which represents 3.7% of the total number of colon cancers in our series) with those of 418 patients with right colon and 475 patients with left colon cancers by univariate and multivariate analyses, using logistic regression analysis and cox's proportional hazards model. splenic flexure cancers had a high risk of obstruction (26.5% of patients), and had a more advanced stage and lower cure rate than left colon cancers. logistic regression analysis revealed that two independent factors, colonic obstruction and the presence",carcinoma splenic flexure multivariate predictive factor clinicopathological characteristic outcome surgery clinicopathological characteristic outcome splenic flexure surgery yet fully elucidate current therefore establish predictive factor relate splenic flexure outcome surgery compare clinicopathological characteristic outcome splenic flexure represent total number colon series right colon left colon univariate multivariate use logistic regression cox proportional hazard model splenic flexure high risk obstruction advanced stage low cure rate leave colon logistic regression reveal two independent factor colonic obstruction presence,a,Colon Cancer
"CDX2 expression and perioperative patient serum affects the adhesion properties of cultured colon cancer cells Colon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer with surgical resection of the tumor being the primary choice of treatment. However, the surgical stress response induced during treatment may be related to a higher risk of recurrence. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of surgery on adhesion of cultured colon cancer cells with or without expression of the tumour suppressor CDX2. We enrolled 30 patients undergoing elective, curatively intended laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer in this study. Blood samples were drawn 1 day prior to surgery and 24 h after surgery. The samples of pre- and postoperative serum was applied to wild type colon cancer LS174T cells and CDX2 inducible LS174T cells and adhesion was measured with Real-Time Cell-Analysis iCELLigence using electrical impedance as a readout to monitor changes in the cellular adhesion. Adhesion abilities of wild type LS174T cells seeded in postoperative serum was significantly increased compared to cells seeded in preoperative serum. When seeding the CDX2 inducible LS174T cells without CDX2 expression in pre- and postoperative serum, no significant difference in adhesion was found. However, when inducing CDX2 expression in these cells, the adhesion abilities in pre- and postoperative serum resembled those of the LS174T wild type cell line. We found that the adhesion of colon cancer cells was significantly increased in postoperative versus preoperative serum, and that CDX2 expression affected the adhesive ability of cancer cells. The results of this study may help to elucidate the pro-metastatic mechanisms in the perioperative phase and the role of CDX2 in colon cancer metastasis.","cdx2 expression and perioperative patient serum affects the adhesion properties of cultured colon cancer cells colon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer with surgical resection of the tumor being the primary choice of treatment. however, the surgical stress response induced during treatment may be related to a higher risk of recurrence. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of surgery on adhesion of cultured colon cancer cells with or without expression of the tumour suppressor cdx2. we enrolled 30 patients undergoing elective, curatively intended laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer in this study. blood samples were drawn 1 day prior to surgery and 24 h after surgery. the samples of pre- and postoperative serum was applied to wild type colon cancer ls174t cells and cdx2 inducible ls174t cells and adhesion was measured with real-time cell-analysis icelligence using electrical impedance as a readout to",cdx expression perioperative serum affect adhesion property cultured colon cell colon one commonly diagnosed type surgical resection primary choice however surgical stress response induce may relate high risk recurrence examine effect surgery adhesion cultured colon cell without expression suppressor cdx enrol undergo elective curatively intend laparoscopic surgery colon blood sample draw day prior surgery h surgery sample pre postoperative serum apply wild type colon l cell cdx inducible l cell adhesion measure real time cell icelligence use electrical impedance readout,a,Colon Cancer
"Colon Cancer Staging: When Does High Resolution MRI Have a Role? Contrarily to what happens with rectal cancer, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of colon cancer has been limited. However, we may witness a ‘paradigm shift’ in the future. Classically, colon cancer has been assessed by computed tomography (CT) which is considered the workhorse for evaluating this neoplasm as it provides insights not only about local and regional disease as well as about distant metastases. However, as the accuracy of CT is somewhat limited, recent reports about the use of MRI in colon cancers have been published. In this review we will assess the potential role of MRI in the setting of colon cancer, with particular emphasis on primary staging. Overall, MRI seems to offer the potential to distinguish between locally advanced and not locally advanced colon cancers. High resolution MRI may have an advantage in comparison to other techniques – namely CT – related to its high soft tissue discrimination. MRI can, in most studies, identify prognostic factors such as T-stage and extramural venous invasion. However, nodal characterization by MRI has some drawbacks that have a negative impact on the accuracy of the technique. Current evidence about the role of MRI in colon cancer staging is still limited. Although the works published so far offer promising results, the role of this imaging modality is largely dependent on the possible implementation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancers. In this setting, MRI may be very helpful in selecting patients who can benefit from that therapy. Further research on the field, including large multi-institutional studies, is warranted.","colon cancer staging: when does high resolution mri have a role? contrarily to what happens with rectal cancer, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (mri) in the assessment of colon cancer has been limited. however, we may witness a ‘paradigm shift’ in the future. classically, colon cancer has been assessed by computed tomography (ct) which is considered the workhorse for evaluating this neoplasm as it provides insights not only about local and regional disease as well as about distant metastases. however, as the accuracy of ct is somewhat limited, recent reports about the use of mri in colon cancers have been published. in this review we will assess the potential role of mri in the setting of colon cancer, with particular emphasis on primary staging. overall, mri seems to offer the potential to distinguish between locally advanced and not locally advanced colon cancers. high resolution mri may have an advantage",colon stag high resolution mri role contrarily happen rectal role magnetic resonance image mri assessment colon limit however may witness paradigm shift future classically colon assess computed tomography ct consider workhorse evaluate neoplasm provide insight local regional well distant metastasis however accuracy ct somewhat limited recent report use mri colon publish review assess potential role mri setting colon particular emphasis primary stag overall mri seem offer potential distinguish locally advance locally advanced colon high resolution mri may advantage,a,Colon Cancer
"Knockdown of Parkinson's disease-related gene ATP13A2 reduces tumorigenesis via blocking autophagic flux in colon cancer. Accumulating evidence shows that Parkinson’s disease is negatively associated with colon cancer risk, indicating that Parkinson’s disease family proteins may be involved in the initiation of colon cancer. Here, we aimed to identify a Parkinson’s disease-related gene involved in colon cancer, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and test whether it can be used as a target for cancer therapy. We first screened colon cancer and normal tissues for differential expression of Parkinson’s disease-associated genes and identified ATP13A2, which encodes cation-transporting ATPase 13A2, as a putative marker for colon cancer. We next correlated ATP13A2 expression with colon cancer prognosis. We performed a series of ATP13A2 knockdown and overexpression studies in vitro to identify the contribution of ATP13A2 in the stemness and invasive capacity of colon cancer cells. Additionally, autophagy flux assay were determined to explore the mechanism of ATP13A2 induced stemness. Finally, we knocked down ATP13A2 in mice using siRNA to determine whether it can be used as target for colon cancer treatment. Colon cancer patients with high ATP13A2 expression exhibit shorter overall survival than those with low ATP13A2. Functionally, ATP13A2 acts as a novel stimulator of stem-like traits. Furthermore, knockdown of ATP13A2 in HCT116 resulted in decreased levels of cellular autophagy. Additionally, bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the ATP13A2-induced stemness of colon cancer cells. Lastly treatment with ATP13A2 siRNA reduced the volume of colon cancer xenografts in mice. The PD-associated gene ATP13A2 is involved in colon cancer stemness through regulation of autophagy. Furthermore, ATP13A2 is a novel prognostic biomarker for colon cancer and is a potential target for colon cancer therapy.","knockdown of parkinson's disease-related gene atp13a2 reduces tumorigenesis via blocking autophagic flux in colon cancer. accumulating evidence shows that parkinson’s disease is negatively associated with colon cancer risk, indicating that parkinson’s disease family proteins may be involved in the initiation of colon cancer. here, we aimed to identify a parkinson’s disease-related gene involved in colon cancer, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and test whether it can be used as a target for cancer therapy. we first screened colon cancer and normal tissues for differential expression of parkinson’s disease-associated genes and identified atp13a2, which encodes cation-transporting atpase 13a2, as a putative marker for colon cancer. we next correlated atp13a2 expression with colon cancer prognosis. we performed a series of atp13a2 knockdown and overexpression studies in vitro to identify the contribution of atp13a2 in the stemness and invasive capacity of colon cancer cells. additionally, autophagy flux assay were determined to explore the mechanism",knockdown parkinson relate gene atp reduces tumorigenesis via block autophagic flux colon accumulate evidence show parkinson negatively associate colon risk indicate parkinson family protein may involve initiation colon identify parkinson relate gene involve colon elucidate underlying mechanism test whether use target therapy first screen colon normal tissue differential expression parkinson associate gene identify atp encode cation transport atpase putative marker colon next correlate atp expression colon prognosis perform series atp knockdown overexpression vitro identify contribution atp stemness invasive capacity colon cell additionally autophagy flux assay determine explore mechanism,a,Colon Cancer

"Anti-CHI3L1 antibody suppresses colon cancer growth through downregulation of VEGFA and NAMPT expression. Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer. In our previous study, we found that anti-CHIL1 antibody inhibited lung tumorigenesis. It has been reported that CHI3L1 is highly overexpressed in colon cancer tissue compared with normal tissue, and high levels of serum CHI3L1 have been associated with worse colon cancer prognosis. We investigated the anticancer effect of an anti-CHI3L1 antibody on colon cancer cells. The anti-CHI3L1 antibody inhibited the cell growth of colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-CHI3L1 antibody also reduced the migration but increased apoptotic cell death in colon cancer cells. Using STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins), we identified an association between VEGFA and CHI3L1 in colon cancer. We confirmed interaction between VEGFA and CHI3L1 through immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the combination treatment of the anti-CHI3L1 antibody and VEGFA siRNA inhibited cell growth but increased apoptotic cell death. Additionally, using the Human Base database, we found that CHI3L1 and VEGFA are associated with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Furthermore, combining the anti-CHI3L1 antibody and NAMPT siRNA more effectively reduced cell growth and the expression of CHI3L1, VEGFA, and cell growth-related proteins, but significantly increased apoptosis-related proteins. The combination of VEGFA siRNA and NAMPT siRNA more effectively inhibited cell growth. Anti-CHI3L1 antibody inhibited the production of ATP and NADH in colon cancer and had a higher inhibitory effect on these levels when combined with NAMPT siRNA These data demonstrated that anti-CHI3L1 antibody is useful as a potential therapy for colon cancer by inhibiting NAMPT-dependent VEGFA expression and ATP and NADH levels.","anti-chi3l1 antibody suppresses colon cancer growth through downregulation of vegfa and nampt expression. chitinase 3-like 1 (chi3l1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer. in our previous study, we found that anti-chil1 antibody inhibited lung tumorigenesis. it has been reported that chi3l1 is highly overexpressed in colon cancer tissue compared with normal tissue, and high levels of serum chi3l1 have been associated with worse colon cancer prognosis. we investigated the anticancer effect of an anti-chi3l1 antibody on colon cancer cells. the anti-chi3l1 antibody inhibited the cell growth of colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. the anti-chi3l1 antibody also reduced the migration but increased apoptotic cell death in colon cancer cells. using string (search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins), we identified an association between vegfa and chi3l1 in colon cancer. we confirmed interaction between vegfa and chi3l1 through immunoprecipitation. furthermore, the combination treatment of",anti chi l antibody suppress colon growth downregulation vegfa nampt expression chitinase like chi l implicate pathogenesis various include previous find anti chil antibody inhibit lung tumorigenesis report chi l highly overexpressed colon tissue compare normal tissue high level serum chi l associate bad colon prognosis investigate anticancer effect anti chi l antibody colon cell anti chi l antibody inhibit cell growth colon cell concentration dependent manner anti chi l antibody also reduce migration increase apoptotic cell death colon cell use string search tool retrieval interact gene proteins identify association vegfa chi l colon confirm interaction vegfa chi l immunoprecipitation furthermore combination,a,Colon Cancer
"Transduction of murine colon carcinoma cells with interleukin-15 gene induces antitumor effects in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. We examined the antitumor effects caused by murine colon carcinoma cells (Colon 26) transduced with interleukin-15 (IL-15) gene. Although the in vitro proliferation rate of IL-15-secreting Colon 26 (Colon 26/IL-15) cells was not different from that of wild-type (wt) cells, small subcutaneous tumors of Colon 26/IL-15 cells that developed in syngeneic immunocompetent mice regressed spontaneously in contrast to tumors of wt cells. The mice that had eliminated tumors of Colon 26/IL-15 cells rejected wt cells when subsequently challenged. The survival of the mice that had been inoculated intraperitoneally with Colon 26/IL-15 cells was significantly prolonged compared with that of the mice injected with wt cells. However, in an experimental lung metastasis model, the survival of the mice inoculated with Colon 26/IL-15 cells remained the same as that of the mice inoculated with wt cells. The inoculation of Colon 26/IL-15 cells into immunocompromised nude or severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors, but the survival of the immunocompromised mice was significantly longer than that of the mice inoculated with wt cells. The nude mice inoculated with Colon 26/IL-15 cells also survived longer than the severe combined immunodeficient mice with Colon 26/IL-15 cells. Depletion of natural killer cells in nude mice with anti-asialo GM1 antibody did not influence the survival of the mice injected with Colon 26/IL-15 cells. Immunohistological examination revealed that CD31+ cells migrated into tumors of Colon 26/IL-15 cells that developed in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Taken together, our results indicate that an inoculation of IL-15-producing tumor cells can produce antitumor effects that are mediated by a variety of immunocompetent cells.","transduction of murine colon carcinoma cells with interleukin-15 gene induces antitumor effects in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. we examined the antitumor effects caused by murine colon carcinoma cells (colon 26) transduced with interleukin-15 (il-15) gene. although the in vitro proliferation rate of il-15-secreting colon 26 (colon 26/il-15) cells was not different from that of wild-type (wt) cells, small subcutaneous tumors of colon 26/il-15 cells that developed in syngeneic immunocompetent mice regressed spontaneously in contrast to tumors of wt cells. the mice that had eliminated tumors of colon 26/il-15 cells rejected wt cells when subsequently challenged. the survival of the mice that had been inoculated intraperitoneally with colon 26/il-15 cells was significantly prolonged compared with that of the mice injected with wt cells. however, in an experimental lung metastasis model, the survival of the mice inoculated with colon 26/il-15 cells remained the same as that of the mice inoculated with wt",transduction murine colon carcinoma cell interleukin gene induces antitumor effect immunocompetent immunocompromised host examine antitumor effect cause murine colon carcinoma cell colon transduce interleukin il gene although vitro proliferation rate il secrete colon colon il cell different wild type wt cell small subcutaneous colon il cell develop syngeneic immunocompetent mouse regress spontaneously contrast wt cell mouse eliminate colon il cell reject wt cell subsequently challenge survival mouse inoculate intraperitoneally colon il cell significantly prolong compare mouse inject wt cell however experimental lung metastasis model survival mouse inoculate colon il cell remain mouse inoculate wt,a,Colon Cancer
"Paracrine factors from adipose-mesenchymal stem cells enhance metastatic capacity through Wnt signaling pathway in a colon cancer cell co-culture model Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tumors have emerged as progenitors involved in stroma formation and metastasis of cancers, partially owing to their abilities to differentially express paracrine factors related to the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. In this regard, increasing evidence has shown that MSCs have impacts on the malignancy of colon cancer, however, the underpinning mechanisms by which MSCs promote cancer metastasis remain elusive. To investigate the crosstalk between adipose-derived MSCs (AMSCs) isolated from adipose tissues and colon cancer cells, a co-culture transwell model of AMSCs and colon cancer cells was employed, and the activation of Wnt signaling and paracrine factors in colon cancer cells and AMSCs were measured. The results showed that AMSCs could enhance the metastatic capacity of colon cancer cells with an elevated expression of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (EMT)-associated genes in a contact-dependent manner. Reciprocally, colon cancer cells were able to induce AMSCs to produce metastasis-related factors and cytokines, such as FGF10, VEGFC and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in part through a mechanism of an activation of Wnt signaling, by which these factors in turn activate Wnt signaling of colon cancer cells. Intriguingly, an inhibition of Wnt signaling leads a reduced capacity of invasion and colony formation of colon cancer cells in vitro, and the tumorigenicity of cancer cells in a murine model. These findings thus suggest that the crosstalk between the Wnt signaling of cancer cells and paracrine factors of AMSCs has an implication in colon cancer malignancy. This study thus uncovers a novel Wnt-paracrine factors mediated-crosstalk between colon cancer cells and AMSCs in cancer malignancy.","paracrine factors from adipose-mesenchymal stem cells enhance metastatic capacity through wnt signaling pathway in a colon cancer cell co-culture model mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) in tumors have emerged as progenitors involved in stroma formation and metastasis of cancers, partially owing to their abilities to differentially express paracrine factors related to the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. in this regard, increasing evidence has shown that mscs have impacts on the malignancy of colon cancer, however, the underpinning mechanisms by which mscs promote cancer metastasis remain elusive. to investigate the crosstalk between adipose-derived mscs (amscs) isolated from adipose tissues and colon cancer cells, a co-culture transwell model of amscs and colon cancer cells was employed, and the activation of wnt signaling and paracrine factors in colon cancer cells and amscs were measured. the results showed that amscs could enhance the metastatic capacity of colon cancer cells with an elevated expression of",paracrine factor adipose mesenchymal stem cell enhance metastatic capacity wnt signal pathway colon cell co culture model mesenchymal stem cell mscs emerge progenitor involve stroma formation metastasis partially owe ability differentially express paracrine factor relate proliferation invasion cell regard increase evidence show msc impact malignancy colon however underpinning mechanism mscs promote metastasis remain elusive investigate crosstalk adipose derive mscs amscs isolate adipose tissue colon cell co culture transwell model amscs colon cell employ activation wnt signaling paracrine factor colon cell amscs measure result show amscs could enhance metastatic capacity colon cell elevated expression,a,Colon Cancer
"Secretion of interleukin-10 from murine colon carcinoma cells suppresses systemic antitumor immunity and impairs protective immunity induced against the tumors Interleukin -10 ( IL -10 ) is a T helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cytokine that suppresses Th1 -mediated, cell -mediated immune responses and reciprocally enhances antibody -mediated responses. Previous studies, however, demonstrated that forced expression of the IL -10 gene in tumor cells could unexpectedly produce antitumor effects. We then examined whether tumor -derived IL -10 could modulate systemic immune responses. Murine colon carcinoma ( Colon 26 ) cells that were retrovirally transduced with the murine IL -10 gene ( Colon 26 / IL -10 ) were inoculated in syngeneic immunocompetent or T cell -defective nude mice. Growth of Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors was augmented in immunocompetent and, to less extent, in nude mice compared with that of wild -type tumors developed in respective mice. Growth of wild -type tumors was accelerated to the same level as that of Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors when wild type and Colon 26 / IL -10 cells were respectively inoculated in different flanks of the same immunocompetent mice. This enhanced growth of wild -type tumors was not observed in nude mice. Immunocompetent mice that had rejected IL -2 -or IL -12 -secreting Colon 26 cells developed protective immunity and became completely resistant to wild -type Colon 26 cells subsequently challenged. However, some of the mice that had rejected IL -2 or IL -12 producers developed Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors inoculated thereafter.

"Developmental pluripotency-associated 4: a novel predictor for prognosis and a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer. Developmental pluripotency-associated 4 (Dppa4) gene plays an important role in self-renewal and pluripotency sustainability in embryonic stem cells. It is re-expressed in several malignant tumors and is identified as a new pluripotency-related oncogene. The present study investigates the expression and clinical significance of Dppa4 in colon cancer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to evaluate Dppa4 mRNA and protein expression in 39 pairs of fresh-frozzen colon cancer samples, which were compared with adjacent normal mucosa. The Dppa4 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemical techniques using colon tissue microarrays (TMA). The sample included 185 cancer specimens and corresponding normal colorectal mucosa. The effect of Dppa4 knockdown on colorectal cancer cell proliferation was investigated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays and colony-formation assays. Both the mRNA and protein level expression of Dppa4 gene was found to be upregulated in colon cancer tissues. Furthermore, the upregulated expression of Dppa4 was significantly correlated with the results of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (P = 0.01), invasion depth (P = 0.028), nodal involvement (P = 0.012), distant metastasis (P = 0.003), and differentiation (P = 0.002).

"Surgical resection of locally advanced primary transverse colon cancer--not a worse outcome in stage II tumor. In locally advanced primary transverse colon cancer, a tumor may cause perforation or invade adjacent organs. Extensive resection is the best choice of treatment, but such procedures must be weighed against the potential survival benefits. This study was performed to identify the clinicopathological features and treatment outcomes of such tumors. We retrospectively reviewed the database of the Colorectal Cancer Registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between February 1995 and December 2005. Patients with colon cancer sited between the hepatic and splenic flexure that involved an adjacent organ without distant metastasis were defined as having locally advanced transverse colon cancer. A total of 827 patients who underwent surgery for transverse primary colon cancer were enrolled in the study. Stage II and stage III colon cancer were diagnosed in 548 patients. Thirty-two (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with locally advanced tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that stage III, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen ≥5 ng/mL, a tumor with perforation or obstruction, and the presence of a locally advanced tumor were significant prognostic factors for both overall and cancer-specific survival. Postoperative morbidity rates differed significantly between the locally advanced and non-locally advanced tumor groups (22.7% vs. 12.3%, P < 0.01). No significant overall survival difference was observed among the stage II transverse colon tumors (P = 0.21). Surgical resection of locally advanced transverse colon tumors resulted in a higher morbidity and mortality than that of non-locally advanced tumors, but the benefit of extensive surgery in the case of locally advanced tumors cannot be underestimated. Furthermore, this benefit is more pronounced in the case of stage II tumors.","surgical resection of locally advanced primary transverse colon cancer--not a worse outcome in stage ii tumor. in locally advanced primary transverse colon cancer, a tumor may cause perforation or invade adjacent organs. extensive resection is the best choice of treatment, but such procedures must be weighed against the potential survival benefits. this study was performed to identify the clinicopathological features and treatment outcomes of such tumors. we retrospectively reviewed the database of the colorectal cancer registry of chang gung memorial hospital between february 1995 and december 2005. patients with colon cancer sited between the hepatic and splenic flexure that involved an adjacent organ without distant metastasis were defined as having locally advanced transverse colon cancer. a total of 827 patients who underwent surgery for transverse primary colon cancer were enrolled in the study. stage ii and stage iii colon cancer were diagnosed in 548 patients. thirty-two (5.8%) patients were diagnosed",surgical resection locally advanced primary transverse colon bad outcome stage ii locally advanced primary transverse colon may cause perforation invade adjacent organ extensive resection best choice procedure must weigh potential survival benefit perform identify clinicopathological feature outcome retrospectively review database colorectal registry chang gung memorial hospital february december colon sit hepatic splenic flexure involve adjacent organ without distant metastasis define locally advanced transverse colon total undergo surgery transverse primary colon enrol stage ii stage iii colon diagnose thirty two diagnose,a,Colon Cancer
"Oroxylin A suppresses the development and growth of colorectal cancer through reprogram of HIF1α-modulated fatty acid metabolism The occurrence and progress of colon cancer are closely associated with obesity. Therefore, the lipid metabolism, especially fatty acid metabolism, is a significant section of energy homeostasis in colon cancer cells, and it affects many important cellular processes. Oroxylin A is one of the main bioactive flavonoids of Scutellariae radix, which has a strong anticancer effect but low toxicity to normal tissue. In previous studies, we have proved that oroxylin A reprogrammes metabolism of cancer cells by inhibiting glycolysis. Here, we further investigated the metabolism-modulating effects of oroxylin A on the fatty acid metabolism in colon cancer cells under hypoxia. We found that HIF1α upregulated adipophilin, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and downregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), resulting in the promoted lipid uptake and transport, increased de novo fatty acid synthesis and suppressed fatty acid oxidation. Oroxylin A inactivated HIF1α and reprogrammed fatty acid metabolism of HCT116 cells, decreasing intracellular fatty acid level and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, the rapid decrease of fatty acid level caused by oroxylin A inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-cantenin and inactivated the Wnt pathway, arousing cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. In vivo studies demonstrated that high-fat diet increased the incidence of colon cancer and accelerated tumor development. Importantly, besides the growth inhibitory effects on colon cancer xenograft, oroxylin A prevented carcinogenesis and delayed progress of primary colon cancer as well. Our studies enriched the metabolic regulatory mechanism of oroxylin A, and suggested that oroxylin A was a potent candidate for the treatment and prevention of colorectal cancer.","oroxylin a suppresses the development and growth of colorectal cancer through reprogram of hif1α-modulated fatty acid metabolism the occurrence and progress of colon cancer are closely associated with obesity. therefore, the lipid metabolism, especially fatty acid metabolism, is a significant section of energy homeostasis in colon cancer cells, and it affects many important cellular processes. oroxylin a is one of the main bioactive flavonoids of scutellariae radix, which has a strong anticancer effect but low toxicity to normal tissue. in previous studies, we have proved that oroxylin a reprogrammes metabolism of cancer cells by inhibiting glycolysis. here, we further investigated the metabolism-modulating effects of oroxylin a on the fatty acid metabolism in colon cancer cells under hypoxia. we found that hif1α upregulated adipophilin, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and downregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt1), resulting in the promoted lipid uptake and transport, increased de novo fatty",oroxylin suppress development growth colorectal reprogram hif modulate fatty acid metabolism occurrence progress colon closely associate obesity therefore lipid metabolism especially fatty acid metabolism significant section energy homeostasis colon cell affect many important cellular process oroxylin one main bioactive flavonoid scutellariae radix strong anticancer effect low toxicity normal tissue previous prove oroxylin reprogrammes metabolism cell inhibit glycolysis far investigate metabolism modulate effect oroxylin fatty acid metabolism colon cell hypoxia find hif upregulated adipophilin fatty acid synthase sterol regulatory element bind protein downregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase cpt result promoted lipid uptake transport increase de novo fatty,a,Colon Cancer
"The miR-487b-3p/GRM3/TGFβ signaling axis is an important regulator of colon cancer tumorigenesis Molecular targeting is an import strategy to treat advanced colon cancer. The current study demonstrates that expression of GRM3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly expressed in mammalian central nervous system, is significantly upregulated in majority of human colonic adenocarcinomas tested and colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GRM3 expression or inhibition of GRM3 activation in colon cancer cells reduces cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, GRM3 antagonizes TGFβ-mediated activation of protein kinase A and inhibition of Protein kinase B (AKT). In addition, TGFβ signaling increases GRM3 protein stability and knockdown of GRM3 enhances TGFβ-mediated tumor suppressor function. Further studies indicate that miR-487b-3p directly targets GRM3. Overexpression of miR-487b-3p mimics the effects of GRM3 knockdown and suppresses the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo. Expression of miR-487b-3p is decreased in colon adenocarcinomas and inversely correlates with GRM3 expression. Taken together, these studies indicate that upregulation of GRM3 expression is a functionally important molecular event in colon cancer, and that GRM3 is a promising molecular target for colon cancer treatment. This is particularly interesting and important from a therapeutic standpoint because numerous metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists are available, many of which have been found unsuitable for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders for reasons such as inability to readily penetrate blood brain barriers. As GRM3 is upregulated in colon cancer, but rarely expressed in normal peripheral tissues, targeting GRM3 with such agents would not likely cause adverse neurological or peripheral side effects, making GRM3 an attractive and specific molecular target for colon cancer treatment.","the mir-487b-3p/grm3/tgfβ signaling axis is an important regulator of colon cancer tumorigenesis molecular targeting is an import strategy to treat advanced colon cancer. the current study demonstrates that expression of grm3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly expressed in mammalian central nervous system, is significantly upregulated in majority of human colonic adenocarcinomas tested and colon cancer cell lines. knockdown of grm3 expression or inhibition of grm3 activation in colon cancer cells reduces cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. mechanistically, grm3 antagonizes tgfβ-mediated activation of protein kinase a and inhibition of protein kinase b (akt). in addition, tgfβ signaling increases grm3 protein stability and knockdown of grm3 enhances tgfβ-mediated tumor suppressor function. further studies indicate that mir-487b-3p directly targets grm3. overexpression of mir-487b-3p mimics the effects of grm3 knockdown and suppresses the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo. expression of mir-487b-3p is decreased in",mir b p grm tgf signal axis important regulator colon tumorigenesis molecular targeting import strategy treat advanced colon current demonstrate expression grm metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly express mammalian central nervous system significantly upregulated majority human colonic adenocarcinoma test colon cell line knockdown grm expression inhibition grm activation colon cell reduce cell survival anchorage independent growth vitro inhibits growth vivo mechanistically grm antagonizes tgf mediate activation protein kinase inhibition protein kinase b akt addition tgf signal increase grm protein stability knockdown grm enhances tgf mediate suppressor function indicate mir b p directly target grm overexpression mir b p mimic effect grm knockdown suppress tumorigenicity colon cell vivo expression mir b p decrease,a,Colon Cancer
"Karyopherin alpha 2 is a novel prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer Karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2), a member of the karyopherin family, plays a vital role in carcinogenesis. Yet its role in colon cancer is poorly characterized. We sought to clarify the clinical significance of its dysregulated expression in human colon tumor specimens. We evaluated KPNA2 mRNA and protein expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in 40 primary colon cancer tissues and paired adjacent normal colon mucosa specimens. KPNA2 protein expression in colon tissue microarray of tumor and normal tissue specimens and lymph node metastasis specimens obtained from 195 colon cancer patients were analyzed immunohistochemically. The effect of KPNA2 knockdown on carcinogenesis potential of human colon cancer cells was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), colony formation, cell migration, and tumorigenesis in nude mice. KPNA2 was expressed at higher levels in colon tumors and lymph node metastasis specimens than in normal tissues. Patients with KPNA2-positive tumors were significantly correlated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (p = 0.01), T-classification (p = 0.018), regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.025), distant metastasis (p = 0.014), and differentiated degree (p = 0.001).

"PKN2 in colon cancer cells inhibits M2 phenotype polarization of tumor-associated macrophages via regulating DUSP6-Erk1/2 pathway. Protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is a PKC-related serine/threonine-protein kinase. PKN2 is required for tumor cell migration, invasion and apoptosis. However, the functional role of PKN2 in regulating tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization in colon cancer has never been reported. PKN2 expression in human colon cancer tissues was examined with immunohistochemistry (IHC). M1/M2 macrophage signatures were evaluated by RT-PCR, IHC and flow cytometry. The effects of PKN2 on tumor growth and TAM polarization were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. PKN2 targeted cytokines/pathway were analyzed by gene expression analysis and further confirmed by PCR, luciferase assay or western blot. Correlations between PKN2 and transcriptional factors for IL4 and IL10 were confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. The catalytic activities of PKN2 and DUSP6 were determined by kinase activity assay. Interactions between PKN2 and DUSP6 were confirmed by Co-IP. The expression of PKN2 in colon cancer cells predicted a favorable prognosis and was associated with low M2 macrophage content in human colon cancer tissues. PKN2 inhibited tumor growth in mice xenograft model and inhibited M2 phenotype polarization both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PKN2 suppresses the expression of IL4 and IL10 from colon cancer cells by inhibiting Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which is required for phosphorylation and binding of CREB and Elk-1 to the promoters of IL4 and IL10. DUSP6, which is phosphorylated and activated through direct association with PKN2, suppresses Erk1/2 activation.

"ACTL6A expression promotes invasion, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of colon cancer Metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with advanced stage colon cancer. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in invasion and metastasis. Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A) is vital for embryogenesis and differentiation and is also critical for metastasis and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma, as observed in our previous study. In the present study, we further explored the role of ACTL6A in colon cancer metastasis. ACTL6A expression levels were analyzed in normal colon, colon adenoma and colon cancer specimens using public databases and tissue samples. ACTL6A expression and its association with clinicopathologic features of colon cancer patients were also analyzed. ACTL6A-overexpression and ACTL6A-knockdown colon cancer cells were used to perform cytological experiments to explore the potential biological function of ACTL6A in metastasis and EMT in colon cancer. The data from both the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Oncomine databases showed that ACTL6A expression levels in colon adenoma and cancer were higher than those in normal colon samples. The ACTL6A expression level in fresh colon cancer specimens was also higher than that in the corresponding adjacent normal colon specimens. Patients with high ACTL6A expression directly correlated with advanced pT status, distant metastasis, poor differentiation and microvascular/perineural invasion. ACTL6A overexpression promoted migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, whereas ACTL6A knockdown exhibited the opposite effect in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated that ACTL6A promoted EMT in colon cancer cells in vitro. Our findings indicate that ACTL6A exhibits pro-tumor function and acts as an EMT activator in colon cancer.

"Stat3 up-regulates expression of nicotinamide N -methyltransferase in human cancer cells To discover new molecular targets for cancer therapy and diagnosis, we surveyed signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3)-regulated genes, because constitutive activation of Stat3 is associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. We investigated the Stat3-regulated genes in 293 cells with cDNA microarray analysis and found that Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was induced on stimulation of the cells with leukemia inhibitory factor. We examined the expression of NNMT in several types of cancer cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. To examine the role of Stat3, Hep-G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were transfected with NNMT promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with conditionally active Stat3 (Stat3ER) or dominant-negative Stat3 expression vector and NNMT promoter activity was determined. The expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 in 88 colon cancer tissues and 17 normal colon tissues was examined with immunohistochemical analysis. In Hep-G2 cells and SW480 colon cancer cells, NNMT expression increased on stimulation of the cells with interleukin 6. NNMT promoter activity in Hep-G2 cells was dependent on the activation of Stat3. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and HT29 colon cancer cells expressed constitutively a high level of NNMT. Treatment of these cells with Stat3 siRNA or curcumin, which inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, resulted in reduction of the NNMT level. We found a correlation between the expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 (P < 0.001) in the colon cancer tissues. NNMT is a novel Stat3-regulated gene. Its expression is enhanced with the activation of Stat3 in colon cancer tissues. NNMT may be a potential candidate for a tumor marker of various kinds of cancers.","stat3 up-regulates expression of nicotinamide n -methyltransferase in human cancer cells to discover new molecular targets for cancer therapy and diagnosis, we surveyed signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (stat3)-regulated genes, because constitutive activation of stat3 is associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. we investigated the stat3-regulated genes in 293 cells with cdna microarray analysis and found that nicotinamide n-methyltransferase (nnmt) was induced on stimulation of the cells with leukemia inhibitory factor. we examined the expression of nnmt in several types of cancer cells by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. to examine the role of stat3, hep-g2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were transfected with nnmt promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with conditionally active stat3 (stat3er) or dominant-negative stat3 expression vector and nnmt promoter activity was determined. the expression of nnmt and activated stat3 in 88 colon cancer tissues and 17 normal colon tissues was examined with immunohistochemical analysis. in hep-g2 cells",stat regulates expression nicotinamide n methyltransferase human cell discover new molecular target therapy diagnosis survey signal transducer activator transcription stat regulate gene constitutive activation stat associate wide variety human malignancy investigate stat regulate gene cell cdna microarray find nicotinamide n methyltransferase nnmt induce stimulation cell leukemia inhibitory factor examine expression nnmt several type cell real time quantitative rt pcr examine role stat hep g hepatocellular carcinoma cell transfected nnmt promoter luciferase reporter construct together conditionally active stat stat er dominant negative stat expression vector nnmt promoter activity determine expression nnmt activate stat colon tissue normal colon tissue examine immunohistochemical hep g cell,a,Colon Cancer

In this study, we evaluated knowledge of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy screening. This cross-sectional study was carried out among 461 people who were under the patronage of a local relief foundation and referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy to the Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease Research Center (GLDRC), Rasht, north of Iran, from March 2016 to March 2017. A well-defined two-sectioned questionnaire was carried out for each group. Overall, 300 and 161 individuals were in the gastric and colon cancer knowledge group, respectively. The level of knowledge in various areas of gastric and colon cancer was desirable. In general, the average of different domains in gastric and colon cancer knowledge questions were 20.2 ± 6.6 and 19.2 ± 4.9, with the knowledge level higher than the mean in gastric cancer (58%) and colon cancer (67.1%). The mean score of knowledge of GI cancers in terms of risk factor indicated a significant relationship between BMI and alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, a meaningful relationship between symptoms and BMI with knowledge was declared. About domains of colon cancer, there was a significant relationship between younger age and knowledge in the risk factor. The results of this study can provide an opportunity to formulate strategies to achieve goals, especially in the field of education, prevention, and control of the disease by raising knowledge for the general public and educating people who are responsible for providing and delivering health services to this community.","knowledge about gastrointestinal cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy during a screening program: a cross-sectional study in guilan, north of iran the most northern and northwestern regions of iran are at a high risk for gastrointestinal cancers. in this study, we evaluated knowledge of gastrointestinal (gi) cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy screening. this cross-sectional study was carried out among 461 people who were under the patronage of a local relief foundation and referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy to the gastrointestinal and liver disease research center (gldrc), rasht, north of iran, from march 2016 to march 2017. a well-defined two-sectioned questionnaire was carried out for each group. overall, 300 and 161 individuals were in the gastric and colon cancer knowledge group, respectively. the level of knowledge in various areas of gastric and colon cancer was desirable. in general, the average of different domains in gastric and",knowledge gastrointestinal people refer endoscopy colonoscopy screening program cross sectional guilan north iran northern northwestern region iran high risk gastrointestinal evaluate knowledge gastrointestinal gi people refer endoscopy colonoscopy screening cross sectional carry among people patronage local relief foundation refer endoscopy colonoscopy gastrointestinal liver research center gldrc rasht north iran march march well define two sectioned questionnaire carry group overall individual gastric colon knowledge group respectively level knowledge various area gastric colon desirable general average different domain gastric,a,Colon Cancer
"Endoscopic resection of T1 colorectal cancer prior to surgery does not affect surgical adverse events and recurrence Although a “no-touch isolation” technique is used in colorectal cancer surgery to reduce the risk of metastatic induction, endoscopic resection (ER) prior to surgery may work against this aim. This study evaluated the effects of initial ER on short- and long-term outcomes in T1 colorectal cancer. This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with pathological T1 colorectal cancer who underwent colorectal surgical resection at a Japanese tertiary cancer center between 2002 and 2012. A total of 548 eligible patients were divided into two groups: patients initially treated using surgical resection with lymph node dissection (LND) (primary group, n = 304) and patients treated using initial ER and additional surgical resection with LND (secondary group, n = 244). The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method based on propensity score was used to compare postoperative complications and long-term recurrence. The incidence of postoperative complications with Clavien–Dindo classification grade ≥ II was 10.9% and 7.4% in the primary and secondary groups, respectively (p = 0.16). Multivariate analysis with a logistic proportional hazard regression model using IPTW revealed no significant differences in postoperative complications between the two groups (p = 0.79). During a median follow-up after surgery of 61.4 months, recurrence was observed in 3 (1.0%) and 8 (3.3%) patients, respectively (p = 0.06).

"ACLY facilitates colon cancer cell metastasis by CTNNB1 Colon cancer is the second leading cancer worldwide. Recurrent disease and chemotherapeutic drug resistance are very common in the advanced stage of colon cancer. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), the first-step rate-controlling enzyme in lipid synthesis, is elevated in colon cancer. However, it remains unclear about the exact role of ACLY in the development of colon cancer metastasis. To evaluate the role of ACLY in colon cancer metastasis, we performed cell migration and invasion assays in two ACLY-deficient colon cancer cell lines. Colon cancer mouse model is used to examine ACLY’s effects on colon metastasis potentials in vivo. We analyzed the correlation between ACLY and CTNNB1 protein in 78 colon cancer patients by Pearson correlation. To finally explore the relationship of ACLY and CTNNB1, we used western blots, migration and invasion assays to confirm that ACLY may regulate metastasis by CTNNB1. Our data showed that the abilities of cell migration and invasion were attenuated in ACLY-deficient HCT116 and RKO cell lines. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of ACLY in promoting colon cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. ACLY could stabilize CTNNB1 (beta-catenin 1) protein by interacting, and the complex might promote CTNNB1 translocation through cytoplasm to nucleus, subsequently promote the CTNNB1 transcriptional activity and migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 78 colon cancer patients showed that the high expression levels of ACLY and CTNNB1 protein was positively correlated with metastasis of colon cancer. These results shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying colon cancer metastasis, which might help in improving therapeutic efficacy.","acly facilitates colon cancer cell metastasis by ctnnb1 colon cancer is the second leading cancer worldwide. recurrent disease and chemotherapeutic drug resistance are very common in the advanced stage of colon cancer. atp-citrate lyase (acly), the first-step rate-controlling enzyme in lipid synthesis, is elevated in colon cancer. however, it remains unclear about the exact role of acly in the development of colon cancer metastasis. to evaluate the role of acly in colon cancer metastasis, we performed cell migration and invasion assays in two acly-deficient colon cancer cell lines. colon cancer mouse model is used to examine acly’s effects on colon metastasis potentials in vivo. we analyzed the correlation between acly and ctnnb1 protein in 78 colon cancer patients by pearson correlation. to finally explore the relationship of acly and ctnnb1, we used western blots, migration and invasion assays to confirm that acly may regulate metastasis by ctnnb1. our data showed",acly facilitate colon cell metastasis ctnnb colon second leading worldwide recurrent chemotherapeutic drug resistance common advanced stage colon atp citrate lyase acly first step rate control enzyme lipid synthesis elevate colon however remain unclear exact role acly development colon metastasis evaluate role acly colon metastasis perform cell migration invasion assay two acly deficient colon cell line colon mouse model use examine acly effect colon metastasis potential vivo analyze correlation acly ctnnb protein colon pearson correlation finally explore relationship acly ctnnb use western blot migration invasion assay confirm acly may regulate metastasis ctnnb data show,a,Colon Cancer

"Laparoscopic ileo-transverse bypass may contribute to achieving curative resection for locally advanced right colon cancer: a case report. The strategy for treating obstructive colon cancers with metastatic lesions remains unclear. Herein, we report a case of laparoscopic ileo-transverse colon bypass (LITB) before preoperative chemotherapy for an obstructive right colon cancer. A 59-year-old woman was referred to our institution (Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Chiba Cancer Center) for liver tumors detected on ultrasound. The clinical diagnosis was ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases. Based on the criteria of the International Union against Cancer Committee, 8th edition, the staging was confirmed as cT4aN1M1a(H), cStage IV. Although the primary tumor in the ascending colon extended beyond the colonic wall, curative resection was possible for both primary and metastatic tumors. We planned to administer chemotherapy before the radical surgery to obtain tumor-free resection margins; however, as the obstruction was fatal, LITB was prioritized and performed using five ports. An intracorporeal side-to-side anastomosis was performed between the ileum, 25 cm from the terminal ileum, and the transverse colon. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 18 without any complications. After LITB, for preoperative chemotherapy, five courses of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CapeOX) + bevacizumab were administered. Six weeks after the preoperative chemotherapy, right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection and right hepatectomy were performed. Pathological findings of the resected specimen confirmed curative resection of both lesions, and a favorable effect of chemotherapy was obtained. The patient has been alive for over 8 months after the surgery, with no evidence of cancer recurrence. This case report demonstrates the effectiveness of LITB for obstructive right colon cancer in patients who need preoperative chemotherapy.","laparoscopic ileo-transverse bypass may contribute to achieving curative resection for locally advanced right colon cancer: a case report. the strategy for treating obstructive colon cancers with metastatic lesions remains unclear. herein, we report a case of laparoscopic ileo-transverse colon bypass (litb) before preoperative chemotherapy for an obstructive right colon cancer. a 59-year-old woman was referred to our institution (department of gastroenterological surgery, chiba cancer center) for liver tumors detected on ultrasound. the clinical diagnosis was ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases. based on the criteria of the international union against cancer committee, 8th edition, the staging was confirmed as ct4an1m1a(h), cstage iv. although the primary tumor in the ascending colon extended beyond the colonic wall, curative resection was possible for both primary and metastatic tumors. we planned to administer chemotherapy before the radical surgery to obtain tumor-free resection margins; however, as the obstruction was fatal, litb was prioritized and",laparoscopic ileo transverse bypass may contribute achieve curative resection locally advanced right colon report strategy treat obstructive colon metastatic lesion remain unclear herein report laparoscopic ileo transverse colon bypass litb preoperative chemotherapy obstructive right colon year old woman refer institution department gastroenterological surgery chiba center liver detect ultrasound diagnosis ascend colon multiple liver metastasis base criterion international union committee th edition staging confirm ct h cstage iv although primary ascending colon extend beyond colonic wall curative resection possible primary metastatic plan administer chemotherapy radical surgery obtain free resection margin however obstruction fatal litb prioritize,a,Colon Cancer

To investigate the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the distribution of cancer nest, cancer stroma and normal mucosa and FOXP3-positive cancer cells in colon cancer patients after resection. Paraffin blocks of operation resection of primary adenocarcinoma of colon were obtained from ninety patients. The distribution of tumor-infiltrating Tregs was detected by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry staining technique to evaluate the prognostic effects by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis using median values as cutoff. The intratumoral Tregs counts were significantly higher than that in corresponding normal mucosa tissues (P < 0.001); the Tregs counts in cancer nest were significantly lower than that in corresponding cancer stroma tissues (P < 0.001); the increased intratumoral Tregs counts were associated with favorable prognosis (P < 0.05); the presence of Tregs in cancer nest was associated with unfavorable prognosis and was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P < 0.05).

"Epidural analgesia associated with better survival in colon cancer. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for potentially curable colon cancer. Otherwise, the surgical stress response might increase the likelihood of cancer dissemination during and after cancer surgery. There is growing evidence that the type of anaesthesia during cancer surgery plays a role in the metastatic process. Therefore, we assessed if the method of anaesthesia is associated with long-term survival after colon cancer surgery. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted including 588 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery, TNM stage I–IV, in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital between 1995 and 2003. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for statistical analysis. Adjustments were made for age, sex, comorbidity, TNM stage, chemotherapy, emergency surgery status and year of incidence. Of the 588 primary colon cancer patients with a median age of 70 years, 399 (68 %) patients underwent colon surgery with epidural anaesthesia, whilst 189 (32 %) patients were operated without epidural anaesthesia. Five-year survival for patients not receiving epidural analgesia was 42 % versus 51 % for patients receiving epidural analgesia (p = 0.03). This effect remained after adjustment for relevant patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics (hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.59), p = 0.01). Subgroup analysis in patients of 80 years and older (n = 100) showed also a better overall survival after receiving epidural analgesia (HR 1.74 (95 % CI 1.11–2.72), p = 0.01). Epidural analgesia during colon cancer surgery was associated with a better overall survival. Prospective trials evaluating the effects of locoregional analgesia on colon cancer recurrence are warranted.","epidural analgesia associated with better survival in colon cancer. surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for potentially curable colon cancer. otherwise, the surgical stress response might increase the likelihood of cancer dissemination during and after cancer surgery. there is growing evidence that the type of anaesthesia during cancer surgery plays a role in the metastatic process. therefore, we assessed if the method of anaesthesia is associated with long-term survival after colon cancer surgery. a retrospective single-centre study was conducted including 588 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery, tnm stage i–iv, in the jeroen bosch hospital between 1995 and 2003. the cox proportional hazard model was used for statistical analysis. adjustments were made for age, sex, comorbidity, tnm stage, chemotherapy, emergency surgery status and year of incidence. of the 588 primary colon cancer patients with a median age of 70 years, 399 (68 %) patients underwent colon surgery with epidural anaesthesia,",epidural analgesia associate good survival colon surgery remain mainstay potentially curable colon otherwise surgical stress response might increase likelihood dissemination surgery grow evidence type anaesthesia surgery play role metastatic process therefore assess method anaesthesia associate long term survival colon surgery retrospective single centre conduct include underwent colorectal surgery tnm stage iv jeroen bosch hospital cox proportional hazard model use statistical adjustment make age sex comorbidity tnm stage chemotherapy emergency surgery status year incidence primary colon median age year underwent colon surgery epidural anaesthesia,a,Colon Cancer
"Primary liver cancer As several of the contributors point out in their introductory paragraphs, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer, and the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The majority of patients have co-existent liver disease and, in some patients, advanced cirrhosis may be the life-limiting disease rather than cancer. Expert assessment of both the malignant and benign disease is therefore required in order to establish the optimal management, and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach is essential. Such an approach is reflected in the authorship of this book with contributions from surgeons, hepatologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, although all are from North American institutions. The initial chapters deal with the aetiology of HCC and recommendations for surveillance. Unlike most cancers there are clear risk factors for the development of cirrhosis, which, once established, carries a 1–8% risk per year of developing HCC. Furthermore, as early disease is potentially curable, HCC meets some of the key criteria for screening; namely, a defined at-risk population and effective therapy for early disease. The problem is that both the currently used modalities, ultrasound and α-feto protein, have limited sensitivity and specificity for early disease. Chowdhury and Satoskar present an excellent overview of the evidence base for the current screening recommendations, and the chapters by Thomas and Oto on radiological diagnosis and by Pillai and Fimmel on emerging biomarkers inform the discussion. The HALT-C study, in which 1000 patients with Hepatitis C were followed prospectively for 4.3 years, demonstrated that the specificity and sensitivity of AFP at the time of diagnosis of HCC was 81 and 61% at 20 ng ml−1, while at 200 ng ml−1 the specificity increased to 100% at the expense of sensitivity, which decreased to 22%. AFP is also affected by patient demographic and underlying liver disease. Alternative markers including the lens culinaris agglutinin glycoform (AFP-L3), des-γ-carboxy prothrombin, α-ℒ-fucosidase, glypican 3 and others remain unproven, and no blood-based biomarker is currently recommended by the AASLD, EASL or EORTC guidelines. Proteomic approaches and measurements of microRNAs have so far failed to yield reproducible and reliable alternatives. In terms of imaging, ultrasound has an overall specificity of 40–80% and sensitivity of 80–100%, but only 25% sensitivity for early disease. Remarkably, only one randomised trial of screening has been performed and this was in China among an at-risk population of 18 000 with hepatitis B. Despite less than 60% adhering to the protocol, there was a 37% reduction in HCC-related mortality. Taking the results of this trial, along with numerous non-randomised prospective studies, the current recommendations are for 6 monthly ultrasound, but there is clearly more to be done to improve both the accuracy of the screening test and the application to the at-risk population. Additionally, at $112 993 per life-year saved, the cost is prohibitive in developing countries with a high incidence. Another promising method to reduce the burden of disease is prevention of known risk factors, which is discussed in the chapter by Dharel and Lau. Worldwide, 52% of patients with HCC have a background of hepatitis B and only 40% have established cirrhosis. With the development of a vaccination to hepatitis B, primary prevention has proved valuable in endemic regions, resulting in a reduction of childhood HCC from 0.52 to 0.13/100 000 since its implementation in 1984. Unfortunately 350 million people remain infected, and secondary prevention using interferon-α has been shown in a randomised trial to reduce the risk of developing HCC from 13 to 2.7%, although the benefit seems greater for those with suppressed HBV DNA. In the western countries and Japan, hepatitis C is present in 50% of those with HCC, but there is no established vaccine, and efforts have focussed on reducing transmission through the screening of blood products introduced in 1992. The risk from transfusion is now less than 0.03%. In patients infected with hepatitis C, interferon-α that causes a sustained virological response, reduces the risk of HCC by ∼75%. Other important risk factors, including cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are preventable with lifestyle modification. Despite the known and preventable risks, HCC-associated mortality has increased by 40% between 1990 and 2004, while overall cancer deaths have declined by 18%.; ; Pathological and radiological diagnosis is discussed, along with a useful chapter devoted to the differential diagnosis of a ‘focal hepatic lesion'. The multitude of staging systems developed are also reviewed with the relative strengths and weaknesses discussed. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification has proved to be one of the most widely used clinical staging system. It has been externally validated and is endorsed by both AASLD and EASL. In addition to prognostic information, the BCLC system provides a therapeutic algorithm that serves as a template for an overview of current therapies discussed by Susnow and colleagues. The accompanying chapter by Dhanasekaran and Cabrera examines emerging therapies that may demand modification of the BCLC system in the future. For early disease, the role of resection as a bridge to transplantation, expansion of the Milan criteria and the role of adjuvant therapy are considered. Novel ablative techniques are reviewed, although High Intensity Focussed Ultrasound (HIFU) is not mentioned. For intermediate disease, conventional transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) using lipiodol/chemotherapy emulsion is increasingly being replaced with the use of drug-eluting beads, and the benefit of combining systemic therapy with TACE is being explored. Transarterial radioembolisation (TARE) seems to be comparable to TACE in non-randomised cohort comparisons, but is struggling to find a place in the BCLC algorithm in the absence of randomised trials. Perhaps the most active area of clinical investigation is in the management of advanced disease. The success of sorafenib has dispelled the prevailing therapeutic nihilism, and a number of pretenders have challenged sorafenib to the throne in recent years. Since this book was published, several of the mentioned trials have been presented and we now know that suntinib, brivanib and the combination of sorafenib and erlotinib have failed in the first-line randomised trials. Second-line treatment following failure or intolerance to sorafenib is an area of intense investigation with multiple new agents under investigation, although discussion of these agents and the rational for their use was somewhat brief.; ; The book also includes excellent reviews of paraneoplastic syndromes, liver cancer in children, liver anatomy and the management of recurrent disease. Molecular pathology was not included and, given the increasing emphasis on personalised medicine, it would have been interesting to review some of the recent data regarding molecular categorisation of HCC.; ; Overall, this book provides an excellent reference for students, trainees and members of a multidisciplinary team wishing to gain additional insights into the domain of their colleagues.","primary liver cancer as several of the contributors point out in their introductory paragraphs, hepatocellular cancer (hcc) is the sixth most common cancer, and the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. the majority of patients have co-existent liver disease and, in some patients, advanced cirrhosis may be the life-limiting disease rather than cancer. expert assessment of both the malignant and benign disease is therefore required in order to establish the optimal management, and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach is essential. such an approach is reflected in the authorship of this book with contributions from surgeons, hepatologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, although all are from north american institutions. the initial chapters deal with the aetiology of hcc and recommendations for surveillance. unlike most cancers there are clear risk factors for the development of cirrhosis, which, once established, carries a 1–8% risk per year of developing hcc. furthermore, as early disease",primary liver several contributor point introductory paragraph hepatocellular hcc sixth common third common cause death worldwide majority co existent liver advance cirrhosis may life limit rather expert assessment malignant benign therefore require order establish optimal management coordinated multidisciplinary approach essential approach reflect authorship book contribution surgeon hepatologists oncologist radiologist pathologist although north american institution initial chapter deal aetiology hcc recommendation surveillance unlike clear risk factor development cirrhosis establish carry risk per year develop hcc furthermore early,b,Liver Cancer
"The Inhibitory Effects of Anti-GPC3 Antibody on Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway as a Biological Therapy in Liver Cancer. To investigate the effects of anti-GPC3 antibody on the Wnt/catenin pathway in liver cancer biology, thus providing a new target for the biological treatment of the disease. A total of 12 BALB/C experimental nude mice were selected as experimental objects. The mice were all male, weighed 15-20 g and aged 4-5 weeks. First, mouse liver cancer models were constructed. Then, the HepG2 liver cancer cells in logarithmic growth period were inoculated into the caudal veins of mouse models. On the 3rd day after inoculation, the tumor formations of nude mice were observed. Second, the anti-GPC3 antibody was designed and constructed, and the activity of anti-GPC3 antibody was detected. The mouse models were divided into the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG), with 6 mice in each group. In the EG, mice were injected with 3 mg/kg of anti-GPC3 antibody in the caudal veins once a day for three consecutive days, while in the CG mice were injected with the same amount of saline as the control. Mice in both groups received 3 injections in total. After the last administration, all mice were euthanized using the decapitation method following anesthesia with ethyl ether. The liver cancer cells of nude mice were extracted and cultured in DMEM medium. The effects of anti-GPC3 antibody on Wnt/β-catenin in liver cancer nude mice and the effects of anti-GPC3 antibody on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mouse liver cancer cells were observed. The bodyweight, liver weight and index of mice in the EG increased significantly (P < 0.05). The serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels of mice in the EG were reduced than those in the CG (P < 0.05). Compared with the CG, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration increased, while the malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration decreased in the liver tissues of mice in the EG (P < 0.05). There was binding activity between GPC3 recombinant protein and the antibody; the affinity constant was K<sub>D</sub> = 1.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M, compared with the commercial anti-GPC3 antibody, the affinity constant was lower. The interference effects of siRNA on anti-GPC3 antibody were detected by Western Blot. After the injection of anti-GPC3 antibody, the expression of β-catenin siRNA in liver cancer cells decreased significantly. The optical microscope images of mouse liver cancer cells in groups were compared. Through down-regulating the Wnt/β-catenin by anti-GPC3 antibody, the morphology of epithelial cells was maintained, the cells were arranged orderly, the cubic structure was kept stable, and the occurrence of EMT was reduced. However, in the CG, the structure of mouse liver cancer cells was disordered, the obvious EMT occurred (P < 0.05). Through down-regulating the expression of Wnt/β-catenin by anti-GPC3 antibody, the invasiveness, and metastasis of liver cancer cells could be effectively inhibited. Compared with the CG, the number of cells passing through the chamber was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The anti-GPC3 antibody had inhibitory effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The occurrence of EMT and the invasiveness of liver cancer cells were inhibited effectively. Therefore, the anti-GPC3 antibody could be used as a reference for clinical molecular targeted therapy of liver cancer.","the inhibitory effects of anti-gpc3 antibody on wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a biological therapy in liver cancer. to investigate the effects of anti-gpc3 antibody on the wnt/catenin pathway in liver cancer biology, thus providing a new target for the biological treatment of the disease. a total of 12 balb/c experimental nude mice were selected as experimental objects. the mice were all male, weighed 15-20 g and aged 4-5 weeks. first, mouse liver cancer models were constructed. then, the hepg2 liver cancer cells in logarithmic growth period were inoculated into the caudal veins of mouse models. on the 3rd day after inoculation, the tumor formations of nude mice were observed. second, the anti-gpc3 antibody was designed and constructed, and the activity of anti-gpc3 antibody was detected. the mouse models were divided into the experimental group (eg) and the control group (cg), with 6 mice in each group. in the eg, mice",inhibitory effect anti gpc antibody wnt catenin signal pathway biological therapy liver investigate effect anti gpc antibody wnt catenin pathway liver biology thus provide new target biological total balb c experimental nude mouse select experimental object mouse male weigh g age week first mouse liver model construct hepg liver cell logarithmic growth period inoculate caudal vein mouse model rd day inoculation formation nude mouse observe second anti gpc antibody design construct activity anti gpc antibody detect mouse model divide experimental group eg control group cg mouse group eg mouse,b,Liver Cancer

"The immunotherapy mechanism of Hedyotis Diffusae Herba in treating liver cancer: a study based on network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation. Liver cancer is a malignant tumor that develops on or inside the liver. Hedyotis diffusa Willd (HDW) plays a significant role in anti-tumor activities; however, its mechanism against liver cancer remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the immunotherapeutic mechanism of HDW in treating liver cancer through network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental validation. Network pharmacology was utilized to identify the active components and potential targets of HDW from the TCMSP database. A potential target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database, followed by function and pathway enrichment analysis of the targets using GO and KEGG methods. In addition, the key targets for HDW against liver cancer were identified using five different algorithms in Cytoscape. The TCGA and HPA databases were used to assess the mRNA and protein expression of core target genes in normal liver and liver cancer tissues and their relationship with overall survival in liver cancer, as well as their role in immune infiltration. Molecular docking between the core components of HDW and the core targets was performed using PyMOL software. The effects of HDW on the proliferation and apoptosis of liver cancer cells were examined using MTT and flow cytometry. The regulatory effects of the core component quercetin on core targets were validated using RT-qPCR and Western blot. A total of 163 potential targets were identified by searching for intersections among 7 types of active components and all potential and liver cancer targets. PPI network analysis revealed the core targets IL6 and TNF. GO enrichment analysis involved 2089 biological processes, 76 cellular components, and 196 molecular functions. KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the anti-cancer effects of HDW might be mediated by the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. Database validation of key targets showed that mRNA and protein expression results for the IL6 gene were contradictory, while those for the TNF gene were consistent, both being underexpressed in liver cancer. Importantly, the expression of IL6 and TNF was related to the infiltration of 24 types of immune cells, with the highest correlation with macrophages. Molecular docking showed that IL6 and TNF had high binding stability with quercetin, with binding energies of - 7.4 and - 6.0 kJ∙mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Experimental validation showed that quercetin inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with protein results indicating that quercetin downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of IL6 and TNF, and upregulated key proteins in the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, AGEs, and RAGE. This study comprehensively elucidates the activity, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of HDW against liver cancer, providing a promising strategy for the scientific basis and treatment mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine in treating liver cancer.","the immunotherapy mechanism of hedyotis diffusae herba in treating liver cancer: a study based on network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation. liver cancer is a malignant tumor that develops on or inside the liver. hedyotis diffusa willd (hdw) plays a significant role in anti-tumor activities; however, its mechanism against liver cancer remains unclear. this study aims to evaluate the immunotherapeutic mechanism of hdw in treating liver cancer through network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental validation. network pharmacology was utilized to identify the active components and potential targets of hdw from the tcmsp database. a potential target protein-protein interaction (ppi) network was constructed using the string database, followed by function and pathway enrichment analysis of the targets using go and kegg methods. in addition, the key targets for hdw against liver cancer were identified using five different algorithms in cytoscape. the tcga and hpa databases were used to assess the mrna",immunotherapy mechanism hedyotis diffusae herba treat liver base network pharmacology bioinformatics experimental validation liver malignant develop inside liver hedyotis diffusa willd hdw play significant role anti activity however mechanism liver remain unclear evaluate immunotherapeutic mechanism hdw treat liver network pharmacology bioinformatics experimental validation network pharmacology utilize identify active component potential target hdw tcmsp database potential target protein protein interaction ppi network construct use string database follow function pathway enrichment target use go kegg method addition key target hdw liver identify use five different algorithm cytoscape tcga hpa database use assess mrna,b,Liver Cancer
"Insulin-like growth factors and liver cancer risk in male smokers Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide (Bosch et al, 2004), occurs more commonly in men, and has a high fatality among affected patients. Although populations of developing countries have the highest risk with the primary cause being hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a trend of increasing incidence has been observed in developed countries (McGlynn et al, 2001). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for over 85% of cases, but underlying mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are not completely understood and may vary across risk factors (Scharf and Braulke, 2003).; ; The liver is the primary source of circulating insulin-like growth factor(IGF)-I, a peptide hormone of which levels peak at puberty and decrease thereafter (Juul, 2003; Pavelic et al, 2007). IGF-I has been implicated in the regulation of cancer cells through effects on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Dunn et al, 1997; Pollak, 2000; Moschos and Mantzoros, 2002; Sachdev and Yee, 2007). Pituitary secretion of growth hormone stimulates hepatic IGF-I production, and more than 75% of circulating IGF-I is bound and regulated by IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 (Ferry et al, 1999). Although previous studies showed an association between high serum concentrations of IGF-I and risk of prostate, colorectal, and breast cancers (Rowlands et al, 2009; Chan et al, 1998, 2002; Ma et al, 1999; Yu et al, 2002; Renehan et al, 2004), subsequent studies have found low IGF-I levels to be associated with an increased risk for brain and kidney cancer (Lonn et al, 2007; Major et al, 2010). Clinical studies suggest a possible inverse IGF-liver function association, although reverse causality, with low IGF-I levels being a consequence of liver damage, remains a possibility (Wu et al, 1988; Buzzelli et al, 1993). Several studies reported the reduced IGF levels to be independent of liver function and progression of disease, providing support for a potential causal connection (Stuver et al, 2000; Mazziotti et al, 2002; Mattera et al, 2003; Elsammak et al, 2006). However, these studies involved patients who already had cirrhosis or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease.; ; Unlike above investigations, the α-Tocopherol, β-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study has a prospective design and involved a large population of men who, although being smokers, did not have liver cirrhosis, chronic alcohol abuse, or cancer at enrolment. In addition, the ATBC Study was conducted in Finland, a developed country with an extremely low prevalence of viral infections of the liver (e.g., HBV, HCV). We conducted a case–cohort study to assess the independent roles of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in liver cancer aetiology in a population without preexisting diseases that are known risk factors.","insulin-like growth factors and liver cancer risk in male smokers liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide (bosch et al, 2004), occurs more commonly in men, and has a high fatality among affected patients. although populations of developing countries have the highest risk with the primary cause being hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, a trend of increasing incidence has been observed in developed countries (mcglynn et al, 2001). hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) accounts for over 85% of cases, but underlying mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are not completely understood and may vary across risk factors (scharf and braulke, 2003).; ; the liver is the primary source of circulating insulin-like growth factor(igf)-i, a peptide hormone of which levels peak at puberty and decrease thereafter (juul, 2003; pavelic et al, 2007). igf-i has been implicated in the regulation of cancer cells through effects on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (dunn et al, 1997; pollak,",insulin like growth factor liver risk male smoker liver fifth common worldwide bosch et al occur commonly men high fatality among affected although population develop country high risk primary cause hepatitis b virus hbv infection trend increase incidence observe developed country mcglynn et al hepatocellular carcinoma hcc account underlie mechanism hepatocarcinogenesis completely understood may vary across risk factor scharf braulke liver primary source circulate insulin like growth factor igf peptide hormone level peak puberty decrease thereafter juul pavelic et al igf implicate regulation cell effect proliferation differentiation apoptosis dunn et al pollak,b,Liver Cancer
"Projected epidemiological trends and burden of liver cancer by 2040 based on GBD, CI5plus, and WHO data. Incidence of liver cancer as one of the most common cancers worldwide and become the significant contributor for the mortality among cancer patients. The disease burden, risk factors, and trends in incidence and mortality of liver cancer globally was described subsequently estimated the projections of liver cancer incidence or mortality by 2040. Data regarding age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for liver cancer was obtained from multiple databases, including GLOBOCAN 2020, CI5 volumes I-XI, WHO mortality database, and Global Burden of Disease (GBD)-2019. Concentrating on worldwide variations, this thorough analysis offers insights into patterns of incidence and mortality based on gender and age. Our findings encompass significant indicators, including age-standardized rates (ASRs), average annual percentage change (AAPC), and future projections extending up to the year 2040. Liver cancer holds the sixth position in terms of most frequently diagnosed cancers and stands as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2020, accounting for 905,677 new cases and 782,000 fatalities. Additionally, liver cancer contributed to 12,528,421 age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), with an age-standardized DALYs rate of 161.92 in 2019 worldwide. The age-specific incidence rates exhibited significant variations across different regions, showing a fivefold difference in males and females. A significant increase in incidence was observed in North Europe and Asia, while North African countries reported a higher mortality burden (ASR, 10 per 100,000) compared to developed countries. Since last few years, the incidence and mortality rates have increased and attained Annual Average Percentage Change (AAPC) incidence rate of 7.7 (95% CI 3.9-11.6) for men and the highest AAPC mortality rate of 12.2 (95% CI 9.5-15.0) for women. In 2019, Western Europe emerged as the high-risk region for DALYs related to smoking and alcohol consumption, while high-income North America carried a high risk for DALYs associated with a high body-mass index. The projected trend indicates a surge in new liver cancer incident cases, expected to rise from around 905,347 to an estimated 1,392,474 by 2040. This study described the evidence pertinent to higher incidence trends in liver cancer, particularly among both young and older adults, encompassing males and females, as well as those who are HIV-infected and HBsAg positive. A significant rise in the young population poses a significant public health concern that warrants attention from healthcare professionals to prioritize the promotion of health awareness and the development of effective cancer prevention strategies, particularly in many developing countries.","projected epidemiological trends and burden of liver cancer by 2040 based on gbd, ci5plus, and who data. incidence of liver cancer as one of the most common cancers worldwide and become the significant contributor for the mortality among cancer patients. the disease burden, risk factors, and trends in incidence and mortality of liver cancer globally was described subsequently estimated the projections of liver cancer incidence or mortality by 2040. data regarding age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for liver cancer was obtained from multiple databases, including globocan 2020, ci5 volumes i-xi, who mortality database, and global burden of disease (gbd)-2019. concentrating on worldwide variations, this thorough analysis offers insights into patterns of incidence and mortality based on gender and age. our findings encompass significant indicators, including age-standardized rates (asrs), average annual percentage change (aapc), and future projections extending up to the year 2040. liver cancer holds the sixth position in terms",project epidemiological trend burden liver base gbd ci plus data incidence liver one common worldwide become significant contributor mortality among burden risk factor trend incidence mortality liver globally describe subsequently estimate projection liver incidence mortality data regard age standardize incidence mortality rate liver obtain multiple database include globocan ci volume xi mortality database global burden gbd concentrate worldwide variation thorough offer insight pattern incidence mortality base gender age finding encompass significant indicator include age standardize rate asrs average annual percentage change aapc future projection extend year liver hold sixth position term,b,Liver Cancer
"Invasion and metastasis of liver cancer: expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1. To study the relationship between intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and liver cancer metastasis and to find predicting factors that could indicate the growth and metastasis of liver cancer. Methods: ICAM-1 expression in fresh tissue of normal liver and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was examined by immunoperoxidase staining. Serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) from patients with a benign HCC tumor, and the expression of ICAM-1 in the orthotopically transplanted LCI-D20 tumor of a nude mouse liver cancer metastasis model, and in human hepatoma, the tumor surrounding tissue and normal liver, was analyzed semiquantitatively by the immuno-dot blot method. Tissue ICAM-1 expression (mRNA level) was detected by Northern blotting. Results: ICAM-1 expression in LD1-20 D metastatic liver cancer had a positive correlation with tumor size and the time after implantation. It increased suddenly as metastasis occurred being 3.03 ± 0.51 before metastasis and 8.24 ± 0.95 after metastasis, P < 0.01, then remained high, appending on the number of sites involved (monosite metastasis 5.48 ± 0.49, multisite metastasis 10.05 ± 1.17, P < 0.05). All six cases of normal liver samples were negative in anti-ICAM-1 immunohistochemical staining, 80.0% (36/45) of the HCC showed some ICAM-1 expression. The rate of positive cells was a little higher in large tumors, tumors with an intact capsule and tumors with metastasis, but there was no significant difference. It was noticed that two cancer emboli also had high ICAM-1 expression. The ICAM-1 concentration in HCC (13.43 ± 0.09) was higher than that in tumor surrounding the liver (5.89 ± 0.17, P < 0.01) and that in normal liver (4.27 ± 0.21, P < 0.01). sICAM-1, like tissue ICAM-1, was higher in HCC patients than in patients (with benign liver tumor and normal controls. Both tissue ICAM-1 and sICAM-1 were higher in the metastasis group than in the group without metastasis (tissue ICAM-1 20.24 ± 0.30 vs 10.23 ± 0.12 P < 0.05; sICAM-1 12.18 ± 0.25 vs 9.77 ± 0.54 P < 0.05). Northern blot analysis revealed that ICAM-1 expression, as indicated by mRNA level, was also higher in HCC and in cancer emboli than in tumor surrounding liver and normal liver. Conclusions: Tissue ICAM-1 and serum sICAM-1 could indicate the stage of HCC, and the potential of hepatoma cells for invasion and metastasis. They may play an important role in the metastasis cascade.","invasion and metastasis of liver cancer: expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1. to study the relationship between intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) and liver cancer metastasis and to find predicting factors that could indicate the growth and metastasis of liver cancer. methods: icam-1 expression in fresh tissue of normal liver and hepatocellular cancer (hcc) was examined by immunoperoxidase staining. serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sicam-1) from patients with a benign hcc tumor, and the expression of icam-1 in the orthotopically transplanted lci-d20 tumor of a nude mouse liver cancer metastasis model, and in human hepatoma, the tumor surrounding tissue and normal liver, was analyzed semiquantitatively by the immuno-dot blot method. tissue icam-1 expression (mrna level) was detected by northern blotting. results: icam-1 expression in ld1-20 d metastatic liver cancer had a positive correlation with tumor size and the time after implantation. it increased suddenly as metastasis occurred being 3.03",invasion metastasis liver expression intercellular adhesion molecule relationship intercellular adhesion molecule icam liver metastasis find predicting factor could indicate growth metastasis liver method icam expression fresh tissue normal liver hepatocellular hcc examine immunoperoxidase stain serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule sicam benign hcc expression icam orthotopically transplant lci nude mouse liver metastasis model human hepatoma surround tissue normal liver analyze semiquantitatively immuno dot blot method tissue icam expression mrna level detect northern blot result icam expression ld metastatic liver positive correlation size time implantation increase suddenly metastasis occur,b,Liver Cancer
"The Demographic and Clinicopathological Characteristics of Hepatopancreatobiliary Cancers From a Specialized Center in India. Introduction Hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers are a distinct group requiring specialized multidisciplinary care. The present study was an analysis of HPB cancers. Methods The institutional data for two years from 2017 to 2018 was retrieved from the hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR) database in Excel format (Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Corp., Redmond, WA). The demographic details, method of diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and disease extent of the patients with HPB primary sites were retrospectively analyzed. Results Out of the 1417 patients with HPB malignancies, 1193 were analyzed. Most of the patients at our center hailed from North India. The distribution of HPB cancers was as follows: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n=717, 60.1%), gallbladder (GB) (n=230, 19.3%), periampullary carcinoma (n=76, 6.37%), head of the pancreas (HOP) (n=55, 4.61%), extrahepatic bile duct (EBD) (n=53, 4.44%), intrahepatic bile duct (IBD) (n=32, 2.68%), and body of the pancreas (BOP) (n=30, 2.52%). The most common disease presentation of HPB cancers was in the seventh and sixth decades of life. Male predominance was seen in all HPB cancers except in GB with a higher incidence in females. The predominant cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) with HCC was viral-related (53.7%) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (34.3%) higher than hepatitis C virus (HCV) (19.2%) followed by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (24.8%) and then alcohol. Adenocarcinoma was the most common morphology in pancreatobiliary malignancies. The disease presentation was locoregional in 63.4% of HCC, 69.7% of periampullary carcinoma, and 50.9% of HOP cases. The patients with EBD and IBD cancers presented commonly with locoregional disease extent in 60.4% and 62.5%, respectively. Perihilar subsite was more commonly detected (71.7%) as compared to the distal one in the patients with EBD cancers. The patients with GB cancers (GBC) presented with distant metastases in 53.5% and locoregional disease in 33%. Distant metastases were present in 76.7% of the patients with BOP cancers. The liver was a common site of distant metastases in GB, periampullary, and pancreatic cancers. Conclusions The present study highlights the characteristics and the variations in disease presentation in different primary tumor sites of HPB cancers. In view of the common locoregionally advanced disease presentation of HCC, the patients with CLD need surveillance for the early detection of lesions. As the patients with HPB cancers show advanced disease presentation, effective locoregional and systemic therapies are needed.","the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of hepatopancreatobiliary cancers from a specialized center in india. introduction hepatopancreatobiliary (hpb) cancers are a distinct group requiring specialized multidisciplinary care. the present study was an analysis of hpb cancers. methods the institutional data for two years from 2017 to 2018 was retrieved from the hospital-based cancer registry (hbcr) database in excel format (microsoft ® corp., redmond, wa). the demographic details, method of diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and disease extent of the patients with hpb primary sites were retrospectively analyzed. results out of the 1417 patients with hpb malignancies, 1193 were analyzed. most of the patients at our center hailed from north india. the distribution of hpb cancers was as follows: hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) (n=717, 60.1%), gallbladder (gb) (n=230, 19.3%), periampullary carcinoma (n=76, 6.37%), head of the pancreas (hop) (n=55, 4.61%), extrahepatic bile duct (ebd) (n=53, 4.44%), intrahepatic bile duct (ibd) (n=32, 2.68%), and body of",demographic clinicopathological characteristic hepatopancreatobiliary specialized center india hepatopancreatobiliary hpb distinct group require specialize multidisciplinary care present hpb institutional data two year retrieve hospital base registry hbcr database excel format microsoft corp redmond wa demographic detail method diagnosis characteristic extent hpb primary site retrospectively analyze result hpb malignancy analyze center hail north india distribution hpb follow hepatocellular carcinoma hcc n gallbladder gb n periampullary carcinoma n head pancreas hop n extrahepatic bile duct ebd n intrahepatic bile duct ibd n body,b,Liver Cancer
"Dietary alterations modulate the microRNA 29/30 and IGF-1/AKT signaling axis in breast Cancer liver metastasis. Metastatic cancer is incurable and understanding the molecular underpinnings is crucial to improving survival for our patients. The IGF-1/Akt signaling pathway is often impaired in cancer leading to its progression and metastases. Diet modification is known to alter the IGF-1/Akt pathway and affect the expression of microRNA involved in tumor initiation, growth and metastases. Liver metastases are one of the most common type of metastases in breast and colon cancer. In the present study, we looked at the effect of diet modification on the expression of microRNA in normal liver and liver with breast cancer metastases using in vivo model. 6-month-old C57BL/6 J mice were put on either an ad libitum (AL) diet, or 40% calorie restricted (CR) diet or were fasted for 24 h (FA) before sacrifice. MicroRNA array analysis, western blot and qRT-PCR were performed using liver tissue to compare the treatment groups. A breast cancer model was also used to study the changes in microRNA expression in liver of a group of BALB/c mice orthotopically injected with 4 T1 cells in the mammary fat pad, put on either an AL or 30% CR diet. Liver and primary tumor tissues were used to perform qRT-PCR to compare the treatment groups. MicroRNA array analysis showed significant changes in miRNA expression in both CR and FA conditions in normal liver. Expression of miR-29 and miR-30 family members was increased in both CR and FA. Western blot analysis of the normal liver tissue showed that CR and FA downregulated the IGF-1/Akt pathway and qRT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b, miR-29c, miR-30a and miR-30b were increased with CR and FA. Liver tissue collected from mice in the breast cancer model showed an increase in expression of miR-29b, miR-29c and miR-30b while tumor tissue showed increased expression of miR-29c, miR-30a and miR-30b. Members of the miR-29 family are known to target and suppress IGF-1, while members of the miR-30 family are known to target and suppress both IGF-1 and IGF-1R. In the present study, we observe that calorie restriction increased the expression of miR-29 and miR-30 in both the normal liver as well as the liver with breast cancer metastases. These findings suggest that dietary alterations may play a role in the treatment of liver metastasis, which should be evaluated further.","dietary alterations modulate the microrna 29/30 and igf-1/akt signaling axis in breast cancer liver metastasis. metastatic cancer is incurable and understanding the molecular underpinnings is crucial to improving survival for our patients. the igf-1/akt signaling pathway is often impaired in cancer leading to its progression and metastases. diet modification is known to alter the igf-1/akt pathway and affect the expression of microrna involved in tumor initiation, growth and metastases. liver metastases are one of the most common type of metastases in breast and colon cancer. in the present study, we looked at the effect of diet modification on the expression of microrna in normal liver and liver with breast cancer metastases using in vivo model. 6-month-old c57bl/6 j mice were put on either an ad libitum (al) diet, or 40% calorie restricted (cr) diet or were fasted for 24 h (fa) before sacrifice. microrna array analysis, western blot and qrt-pcr",dietary alteration modulate microrna igf akt signal axis breast liver metastasis metastatic incurable understand molecular underpinnings crucial improve survival igf akt signal pathway often impair lead progression metastasis diet modification know alter igf akt pathway affect expression microrna involve initiation growth metastases liver metastasis one common type metastasis breast colon present look effect diet modification expression microrna normal liver liver breast metastases use vivo model month old c bl j mouse put either ad libitum al diet calorie restrict cr diet fast h fa sacrifice microrna array western blot qrt pcr,b,Liver Cancer

"Clinical significance of serum IL-18 and IL-18BP in patients with benign or malignant primary liver tumors OBJECTIVE To study the relationship between the serum levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP in the development and growth of primary liver cancer, benign liver tumors and liver cirrhosis and to determine the value of serum IL-18 and IL-18BP in the diagnosis of primary liver cancer. METHODS The serum levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP in 36 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) were detected. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with various benign liver tumors and 21 patients with cirrhosis of liver (LC), determined by using an ELISA assay. The serum levels of AFP in 36 patients with primary liver cancer were examined. The relationship among levels of serum IL-18, IL-18BP and AFP in the primary liver cancer was explored. RESULTS The sIL-18 levels in PHC were signi fi cantly lower than in control group, the benign liver tumor group and the LC group. The sIL-18BP in PHC was signi fi cantly higher than that in control group, benign liver tumor group and LC group ( P < 0.001). There was a close correlation between the levels of IL-18, IL-18BP and clinical stage in PHC: the later clinical stages had lower levels of IL-18 and higher levels of IL-18BP while the earlier clinical stages had higher levels of IL-18 and lower levels of IL-18BP. There was a negative correlation between serum levels of IL-18 and AFP in the PHC group ( r  = -0.7152,  n = 36,  P < 0.01), and there was a positive correlation between serum levels of IL-18 BP and AFP in the patients with PHC (r  = 0.6315,  n = 36,  P < 0.01). The IL-18and IL-18BP in the patients with various benign liver tumors or LC were significantly higher than those in control group. The differences were statistically signifi cant ( P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Serum levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP can reflect the immune function of patients with primary liver cancer, with various benign liver tumors or with LC and can also be indicative of the clinic stage of primary liver cancer. It can be used to assist in making a diagnosis and in determining the clinical stage of PHC. Detecting AFP concurrently can help make the diagnosis of primary liver cancer more precise.","clinical significance of serum il-18 and il-18bp in patients with benign or malignant primary liver tumors objective to study the relationship between the serum levels of il-18 and il-18bp in the development and growth of primary liver cancer, benign liver tumors and liver cirrhosis and to determine the value of serum il-18 and il-18bp in the diagnosis of primary liver cancer. methods the serum levels of il-18 and il-18bp in 36 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma (phc) were detected. eighteen patients were diagnosed with various benign liver tumors and 21 patients with cirrhosis of liver (lc), determined by using an elisa assay. the serum levels of afp in 36 patients with primary liver cancer were examined. the relationship among levels of serum il-18, il-18bp and afp in the primary liver cancer was explored. results the sil-18 levels in phc were signi fi cantly lower than in control group, the benign",significance serum il il bp benign malignant primary liver relationship serum level il il bp development growth primary liver benign liver liver cirrhosis determine value serum il il bp diagnosis primary liver serum level il il bp primary hepatic carcinoma phc detect eighteen diagnose various benign liver cirrhosis liver lc determine use elisa assay serum level afp primary liver examine relationship among level serum il il bp afp primary liver explore result sil level phc signi fi cantly low control group benign,b,Liver Cancer

"Multiple liver metastases with synchronous gastric and transverse colon cancer diagnosed by gastric perforation successfully treated by SOX plus bevacizumab and completely resected by surgery: a case report. Synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach accompanied by liver metastasis is rare. It is often difficult to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for multiple liver metastases of synchronous gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Multidisciplinary treatment is required based on the progression and location of each tumor and chemotherapy for complete resection. A 57-year-old male who complained of acute abdominal pain and fever visited his local hospital. He underwent emergent surgery for peritonitis caused by a gastric perforation. The cytodiagnosis of ascites did not show any tumor cells. There was a liver metastasis in the lateral segment of the liver. We performed a primary closure of the defect and then applied an omentum flap. After surgery, the patient was diagnosed as having synchronous cStage IV transverse colon cancer with multiple liver metastases and cStage IIB gastric cancer. The [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed 18F-FDG uptake by the colon tumor and multiple liver metastases, but there was no uptake in the gastric tumor or lymph nodes. We retrospectively reevaluated the CT findings from a local hospital and detected a liver nodule in segment 2/3 (from 35 to 60 mm) and segment 6 (from 26 to 57 mm), and the tumors had dramatically grown in size in only 2 months. Because complete tumor resection would be difficult, S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) plus bevacizumab therapy was started to control tumor progression. After 20 courses of chemotherapy, the clinical diagnosis was ycStage IV transverse colon cancer and ycStage IIa gastric cancer. We planned a two-step procedure to completely resect the primary tumors and multiple liver metastases. We first performed a laparoscopic right-colon resection+D3 lymphadenectomy and open distal gastrectomy+D2 lymphadenectomy. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 18. After 1 month, we performed open liver resection. The pathological findings showed that the transverse colon was ypT2 (MP) with grade 2 therapeutic effects and that there were no atypical cells in the gastric tumor and multiple liver nodules (pathological complete response). The SOX plus bevacizumab regimen could be an option for controlling tumor progression in synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach with liver metastasis and led to the complete resection of such tumors.","multiple liver metastases with synchronous gastric and transverse colon cancer diagnosed by gastric perforation successfully treated by sox plus bevacizumab and completely resected by surgery: a case report. synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach accompanied by liver metastasis is rare. it is often difficult to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for multiple liver metastases of synchronous gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. multidisciplinary treatment is required based on the progression and location of each tumor and chemotherapy for complete resection. a 57-year-old male who complained of acute abdominal pain and fever visited his local hospital. he underwent emergent surgery for peritonitis caused by a gastric perforation. the cytodiagnosis of ascites did not show any tumor cells. there was a liver metastasis in the lateral segment of the liver. we performed a primary closure of the defect and then applied an omentum flap. after surgery, the patient was diagnosed as",multiple liver metastasis synchronous gastric transverse colon diagnose gastric perforation successfully treat sox plus bevacizumab completely resect surgery report synchronous double colon stomach accompany liver metastasis rare often difficult determine appropriate strategy multiple liver metastasis synchronous gastric colorectal multidisciplinary require base progression location chemotherapy complete resection year old male complain acute abdominal pain fever visit local hospital underwent emergent surgery peritonitis cause gastric perforation cytodiagnosis ascites show cell liver metastasis lateral segment liver perform primary closure defect apply omentum flap surgery diagnose,b,Liver Cancer

"Safety and efficacy of Y-90 microsphere treatment in patients with primary and metastatic liver cancer: the tumor selectivity of the treatment as a function of tumor to liver flow ratio. Treatment records and follow-up data on 40 patients with primary and metastatic liver malignancies who underwent a single whole-liver treatment with Y-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres® Sirtex Medical, Lake Forest, IL) were retrospectively reviewed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the anatomic and physiologic determinants of radiation dose distribution, and the dose response of tumor and liver toxicity in patients with liver malignancies who underwent hepatic arterial Y-90 resin microsphere treatment. Liver and tumor volume calculations were performed on pre-treatment CT scans. Fractional tumor and liver flow characteristics and lung shunt fractions were determined using hepatic arterial Tc-99m MAA imaging. Absorbed dose calculations were performed using the MIRD equations. Liver toxicity was assessed clinically and by liver function tests. Tumor response to therapy was assessed by CT and/or tumor markers. Of the 40 patients, 5 had hepatocellular cancer (HCC), and 35 had metastatic liver tumors (15 colorectal cancer, 10 neuroendocrine tumors, 4 breast cancer, 2 lung cancer, 1 ovarian cancer, 1 endometrial cancer, and 2 unknown primary adenocarcinoma). All patients were treated in a salvage setting with a 3 to 80 week follow-up (mean: 19 weeks). Tumor volumes ranged from 15.0 to 984.2 cc (mean: 294.9 cc) and tumor to normal liver uptake ratios ranged from 2.8 to 15.4 (mean: 5.4). Average administered activity was 1.2 GBq (0.4 to 2.4 GBq).

"Association of the presence of allergic disease with subsequent risk of liver cancer in a nationwide retrospective cohort among Koreans. A number of studies have proposed an inverse association between allergic diseases and risk of cancer, but only a few studies have specifically investigated the risk of primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of allergic diseases with risk of primary liver cancer. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the Korean National Health Insurance Service database consisted of 405,512 Korean adults ages 40 and above who underwent health screening before January 1st, 2005. All participants were followed up until the date of liver cancer, death, or December 31st, 2013, whichever happened earliest. Those who died before the index date or had pre-diagnosed cancer were excluded from the analyses. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of primary liver cancer according to the presence of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. The aHR (95% CI) for overall liver cancer among allergic patients was 0.77 (0.68-0.87) compared to those without allergic disease. Allergic patients had significantly reduced risk of HCC (aHR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.62-0.85) but not ICC (aHR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.73-1.22). The presence of allergies was associated with significantly lower risk of liver cancer among patients whose systolic blood pressure is lower than 140 mmHg (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.78 for overall liver cancer; aHR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.52-0.78 for HCC) but this effect was not observed among patients whose systolic blood pressure is higher than 140 mmHg (aHR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.71-1.18 for overall liver cancer; aHR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.71-1.18 for HCC) The aHR (95% CI) for overall liver cancer of allergic patients with and without chronic hepatitis virus infection were 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.93), respectively. In addition, allergic patients without cirrhosis showed significantly lower risk of overall liver cancer (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.63-0.83). Patients with allergic diseases have significantly lower risk of primary liver cancer compared to those without allergic diseases, which supports the rationale for immunotherapy as an effective treatment for liver cancer.","association of the presence of allergic disease with subsequent risk of liver cancer in a nationwide retrospective cohort among koreans. a number of studies have proposed an inverse association between allergic diseases and risk of cancer, but only a few studies have specifically investigated the risk of primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (icc). the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of allergic diseases with risk of primary liver cancer. we conducted a retrospective cohort study of the korean national health insurance service database consisted of 405,512 korean adults ages 40 and above who underwent health screening before january 1st, 2005. all participants were followed up until the date of liver cancer, death, or december 31st, 2013, whichever happened earliest. those who died before the index date or had pre-diagnosed cancer were excluded from the analyses. cox proportional hazards regression was used to",association presence allergic subsequent risk liver nationwide retrospective cohort among koreans number propose inverse association allergic risk specifically investigate risk primary liver include hepatocellular carcinoma hcc intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma icc evaluate association allergic risk primary liver conduct retrospective cohort korean national health insurance service database consist korean adult age underwent health screening january st participant follow date liver death december st whichever happen early die index date pre diagnose exclude cox proportional hazard regression use,b,Liver Cancer

"Colorectal cancer liver metastases – a population-based study on incidence, management and survival Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths with liver metastases developing in 25–30% of those affected. Previous data suggest a survival difference between right- and left-sided liver metastatic CRC, even though left-sided cancer has a higher incidence of liver metastases. The aim of the study was to describe the liver metastatic patterns and survival as a function of the characteristics of the primary tumour and different combinations of metastatic disease. A retrospective population-based study was performed on a cohort of patients diagnosed with CRC in the region of Stockholm, Sweden during 2008. Patients were identified through the Swedish National Quality Registry for Colorectal Cancer Treatment (SCRCR) and additional information on intra- and extra-hepatic metastatic pattern and treatment were retrieved from electronic patient records. Patients were followed for 5 years or until death. Factors influencing overall survival (OS) were investigated by means of Cox regression. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier estimations and the log-rank test. Liver metastases were diagnosed in 272/1026 (26.5%) patients within five years of diagnosis of the primary. Liver and lung metastases were more often diagnosed in left-sided colon cancer compared to right-sided cancer (28.4% versus 22.1%, p = 0.029 and 19.7% versus 13.2%, p = 0.010, respectively) but the extent of liver metastases were more extensive for right-sided cancer as compared to left-sided (p = 0.001). Liver metastatic left-sided cancer, including rectal cancer, was associated with a 44% decreased mortality risk compared to right-sided cancer (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39–0.79) with a 5-year OS of 16.6% versus 4.3% (p < 0.001). In liver metastatic CRC, the presence of lung metastases did not significantly influence OS as assessed by multivariate analysis (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.80–1.53). The worse survival in liver metastatic right-sided colon cancer could possibly be explained by the higher number of metastases, as well as more extensive segmental involvement compared with left-sided colon and rectal cancer, even though the latter had a higher incidence of liver metastases. Detailed population-based data on the metastatic pattern of CRC and survival could assist in more structured and individualized guidelines for follow-up of patients with CRC.","colorectal cancer liver metastases – a population-based study on incidence, management and survival colorectal cancer (crc) is a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths with liver metastases developing in 25–30% of those affected. previous data suggest a survival difference between right- and left-sided liver metastatic crc, even though left-sided cancer has a higher incidence of liver metastases. the aim of the study was to describe the liver metastatic patterns and survival as a function of the characteristics of the primary tumour and different combinations of metastatic disease. a retrospective population-based study was performed on a cohort of patients diagnosed with crc in the region of stockholm, sweden during 2008. patients were identified through the swedish national quality registry for colorectal cancer treatment (scrcr) and additional information on intra- and extra-hepatic metastatic pattern and treatment were retrieved from electronic patient records. patients were followed for 5 years or until death. factors influencing",colorectal liver metastases population base incidence management survival colorectal crc lead cause associate death liver metastasis develop affected previous data suggest survival difference right leave side liver metastatic crc even though leave sided high incidence liver metastases describe liver metastatic pattern survival function characteristic primary different combination metastatic retrospective population base perform cohort diagnose crc region stockholm sweden identify swedish national quality registry colorectal scrcr additional information intra extra hepatic metastatic pattern retrieve electronic record follow year death factor influence,b,Liver Cancer

"Eribulin-induced liver dysfunction as a prognostic indicator of survival of metastatic breast cancer patients: a retrospective study Eribulin is a non-taxane, microtubule dynamics inhibitor that increases survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Although eribulin is well tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated disease, eribulin-induced liver dysfunction (EILD) can occur, resulting in treatment modification and subsequent poor disease control. We aimed to clarify the effect of EILD on patient survival. The medical records of 157 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with eribulin between July 2011 and November 2013 at Cancer Institute Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. EILD was defined as 1) an increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or 2) initiation of a liver-supporting oral drug therapy such as ursodeoxycholic acid or glycyron. Fatty liver was defined as a decrease in the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio to <0.9 on a computed tomography scan. EILD occurred in 42 patients, including one patient for whom eribulin treatment was discontinued due to severe EILD. The patients who developed EILD had significantly higher body mass indices (BMIs) than those who did not develop EILD (24.5 vs. 21.5, respectively; P < 0.0001), with no difference in the dose intensity of eribulin between the two groups (P = 0.76). Interestingly, the patients with EILD exhibited significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than those without EILD (P = 0.010 and P = 0.032, respectively). Similarly, among 80 patients without liver metastasis, 19 with EILD exhibited significantly longer PFS and OS than the others (P = 0.0012 and P = 0.044, respectively), and EILD was an independent prognostic factor of PFS (P = 0.0079) in multivariate analysis. During eribulin treatment, 18 patients developed fatty liver, 11 of whom developed EILD, with a median BMI of 26.7. Although EILD and fatty liver occurred at a relatively high frequency in our study, most of the patients did not experience severe adverse effects. Surprisingly, the development of EILD was positively associated with patient survival, especially in patients without liver metastases. EILD may be a clinically useful predictive biomarker of survival, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings in another cohort of patients.","eribulin-induced liver dysfunction as a prognostic indicator of survival of metastatic breast cancer patients: a retrospective study eribulin is a non-taxane, microtubule dynamics inhibitor that increases survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. although eribulin is well tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated disease, eribulin-induced liver dysfunction (eild) can occur, resulting in treatment modification and subsequent poor disease control. we aimed to clarify the effect of eild on patient survival. the medical records of 157 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with eribulin between july 2011 and november 2013 at cancer institute hospital were retrospectively analyzed. eild was defined as 1) an increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or 2) initiation of a liver-supporting oral drug therapy such as ursodeoxycholic acid or glycyron. fatty liver was defined as a decrease in the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio to <0.9 on a computed tomography scan.",eribulin induce liver dysfunction prognostic indicator survival metastatic breast retrospective eribulin non taxane microtubule dynamic inhibitor increase survival metastatic breast although eribulin well tolerate heavily pretreated eribulin induce liver dysfunction eild occur result modification subsequent poor control clarify effect eild survival medical record metastatic breast treat eribulin july november institute hospital retrospectively analyzed eild define increase alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase level time upper limit normal initiation liver support oral drug therapy ursodeoxycholic acid glycyron fatty liver define decrease liver spleen attenuation ratio computed tomography scan,b,Liver Cancer
"PKM2 inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance to transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma Therapeutic options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an interventional procedure used to deliver chemotherapy and embolizing agents directly to the tumor and is the procedure of choice for patients with intermediate stage HCC. While effective, more than 40% of patients do not respond to therapy, highlighting the need to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance. We sought to evaluate mechanisms of TACE resistance and evaluate a potential therapeutic target to overcome this resistance. Using a prognostic gene signature which predicts TACE response (TACE Navigator) in a cohort of HCC patients who received TACE, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Transcriptomic and gene pathway analysis were used to identify potential drivers of TACE resistance. Knockdown of the gene encoding rate limiting enzyme PKM2 using shRNA in HCC cell lines, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of PKM2 with shikonin using an in vitro TACE model measured response to chemotherapy under hypoxia. Finally, we replicated the TACE model with shikonin using patient derived cell line organoids (PDC). Functional studies were performed in vitro using immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, glycolysis and hypoxia assays. In patient non-responders, we identified enrichment of the glycolysis pathway, specifically of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. We identified four HCC cell lines which recapitulated a TACE responder-like and non-responder-like phenotype. PKM2 knockdown in HCC cell lines demonstrated a less proliferative and aggressive phenotype as well as improved drug sensitivity to both doxorubicin and cisplatin. In vitro TACE model demonstrated that TACE non-responder-like cells overcame therapeutic resistance and rendered them susceptible to therapy through PKM2 knockdown. Lastly, we obtained similar results using a pharmacologic PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin in both cell lines, and PDC organoids. Elevated PKM2 is associated with treatment resistance and abbreviated survival in patients receiving TACE. Elevated PKM2 in vitro is associated with increased utilization of the glycolysis pathway, resulting in oxygen independent cell metabolism. Through PKM2 knockdown as well as with pharmacologic inhibition with shikonin, non-responder cells can be reprogrammed to act as responders and could improve TACE efficacy in patients.","pkm2 inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance to transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) are limited. transarterial chemoembolization (tace) is an interventional procedure used to deliver chemotherapy and embolizing agents directly to the tumor and is the procedure of choice for patients with intermediate stage hcc. while effective, more than 40% of patients do not respond to therapy, highlighting the need to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance. we sought to evaluate mechanisms of tace resistance and evaluate a potential therapeutic target to overcome this resistance. using a prognostic gene signature which predicts tace response (tace navigator) in a cohort of hcc patients who received tace, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. transcriptomic and gene pathway analysis were used to identify potential drivers of tace resistance. knockdown of the gene encoding rate limiting enzyme pkm2 using shrna in hcc cell lines, as well as",pkm inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance transarterial chemoembolization hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic option hepatocellular carcinoma hcc limit transarterial chemoembolization tace interventional procedure use deliver chemotherapy embolizing agent directly procedure choice intermediate stage hcc effective respond therapy highlight need investigate possible mechanism resistance seek evaluate mechanism tace resistance evaluate potential therapeutic target overcome resistance use prognostic gene signature predict tace response tace navigator cohort hcc receive tace classify responder non responder transcriptomic gene pathway use identify potential driver tace resistance knockdown gene encode rate limit enzyme pkm use shrna hcc cell line well,b,Liver Cancer

"Breast adenocarcinoma liver metastases, in contrast to colorectal cancer liver metastases, display a non-angiogenic growth pattern that preserves the stroma and lacks hypoxia. Although angiogenesis is a prerequisite for the growth of most human solid tumours, alternative mechanisms of vascularisation can be adopted. We have previously described a non-angiogenic growth pattern in liver metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) in which tumour cells replace hepatocytes at the tumour-liver interface, preserving the liver architecture and co-opting the sinusoidal blood vessels. The aim of this study was to determine whether this replacement pattern occurs during liver metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas (BC) and whether the lack of an angiogenic switch in such metastases is due to the absence of hypoxia and subsequent vascular fibrinogen leakage. The growth pattern of 45 BC liver metastases and 28 CRC liver metastases (73 consecutive patients) was assessed on haematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissue sections. The majority of the BC liver metastases had a replacement growth pattern (96%), in contrast to only 32% of the CRC metastases (P<0.0001). The median carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) expression (M75 antibody), as a marker of hypoxia, (intensity x % of stained tumour cells) was 0 in the BC metastases and 53 in the CRC metastases (P<0.0001). There was CA9 expression at the tumour-liver interface in only 16% of the BC liver metastases vs 54% of the CRC metastases (P=0.002). There was fibrin (T2G1 antibody) at the tumour-liver interface in only 21% of the BC metastases vs 56% of the CRC metastases (P=0.04). The median macrophage count (Chalkley morphometry; KP-1 anti-CD68 antibody) at the interface was 4.3 and 7.5, respectively (P<0.0001). Carbonic anhydrase 9 score and macrophage count were positively correlated (r=0.42; P=0.002) in all metastases. Glandular differentiation was less in the BC liver metastases: 80% had less than 10% gland formation vs only 7% of the CRC metastases (P<0.0001). The liver is a densely vascularised organ and can host metastases that exploit this environment by replacing the hepatocytes and co-opting the vasculature. Our findings confirm that a non-angiogenic pattern of liver metastasis indeed occurs in BC, that this pattern of replacement growth is even more prevalent than in CRC, and that the process induces neither hypoxia nor vascular leakage.","breast adenocarcinoma liver metastases, in contrast to colorectal cancer liver metastases, display a non-angiogenic growth pattern that preserves the stroma and lacks hypoxia. although angiogenesis is a prerequisite for the growth of most human solid tumours, alternative mechanisms of vascularisation can be adopted. we have previously described a non-angiogenic growth pattern in liver metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas (crc) in which tumour cells replace hepatocytes at the tumour-liver interface, preserving the liver architecture and co-opting the sinusoidal blood vessels. the aim of this study was to determine whether this replacement pattern occurs during liver metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas (bc) and whether the lack of an angiogenic switch in such metastases is due to the absence of hypoxia and subsequent vascular fibrinogen leakage. the growth pattern of 45 bc liver metastases and 28 crc liver metastases (73 consecutive patients) was assessed on haematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissue sections. the majority of the bc",breast adenocarcinoma liver metastasis contrast colorectal liver metastases display non angiogenic growth pattern preserve stroma lack hypoxia although angiogenesis prerequisite growth human solid alternative mechanism vascularisation adopt previously describe non angiogenic growth pattern liver metastasis colorectal adenocarcinoma crc cell replace hepatocytes liver interface preserve liver architecture co opt sinusoidal blood vessel determine whether replacement pattern occur liver metastasis breast adenocarcinoma bc whether lack angiogenic switch metastasis due absence hypoxia subsequent vascular fibrinogen leakage growth pattern bc liver metastasis crc liver metastasis consecutive assess haematoxylin eosin stain tissue section majority bc,b,Liver Cancer
"Association of hepatitis status with surgical outcomes in patients with dual hepatitis B and C related hepatocellular carcinoma. The conception that serological hepatitis markers determined surgical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) has been well defined. However, little is known about the relationship between surgical outcomes and serological hepatitis markers in patients with dual HBV and HCV related HCC. A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 39 HCC patients with HBV-HCV coinfection who underwent curative hepatectomy between 2001 and 2011 was performed. HBV DNA quantification, expression of HBV antigens, anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) and some clinicopathological characteristics were investigated to show the potential relationship among them and the surgical prognosis. The Cox proportional hazards model identified that HBV DNA quantification of 1,000 IU/mL or higher, HBeAg seropositivity, tumor size of greater than 5 cm, multiple tumors, and vascular invasion were risk factors for HCC prognosis. Thus, HBV DNA quantification, HBsAg level, HBeAg status and HCV-Ab level which may reveal the hepatitis status were further analyzed. The overall survival time in the group with high (≥1,000 IU/mL) HBV DNA quantification was significantly lower than the group with low (<1,000 IU/mL) HBV DNA quantification. Similarly, the high HBsAg level (≥1,000 IU/mL) was associated with poor survival compared with the low HBsAg level. Moreover, HBeAg seropositivity determined a higher cumulative risk for death. However, no significant difference was observed in overall survival time between the groups with low (<10.9 S/CO) and high (≥10.9 S/CO) HCV-Ab level. Compared to HCV-Ab high-level group, the serological HBsAg level was observed significantly higher in HCV-Ab low-level group. Furthermore, the data we analyzed showed these 4 serological hepatitis markers were not correlated with cumulative recurrence rate. On multivariate analysis, none of serological hepatitis markers was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients with dual hepatitis B and C. Among HCC patients with HBV-HCV coinfection, those who with preoperatively high HBV DNA quantification or HBeAg seropositivity had a short survival time and served as poor survival indicators. Serological expression of HBV status rather than HCV status might potentially dominate the surgical outcomes of the Chinese HCC patients with HBV-HCV coinfection.","association of hepatitis status with surgical outcomes in patients with dual hepatitis b and c related hepatocellular carcinoma. the conception that serological hepatitis markers determined surgical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) associated with hepatitis b (hbv) or hepatitis c (hcv) has been well defined. however, little is known about the relationship between surgical outcomes and serological hepatitis markers in patients with dual hbv and hcv related hcc. a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 39 hcc patients with hbv-hcv coinfection who underwent curative hepatectomy between 2001 and 2011 was performed. hbv dna quantification, expression of hbv antigens, anti-hcv signal-to-cutoff ratio (s/co) and some clinicopathological characteristics were investigated to show the potential relationship among them and the surgical prognosis. the cox proportional hazards model identified that hbv dna quantification of 1,000 iu/ml or higher, hbeag seropositivity, tumor size of greater than 5 cm, multiple tumors, and vascular invasion were risk",association hepatitis status surgical outcome dual hepatitis b c relate hepatocellular carcinoma conception serological hepatitis marker determine surgical prognosis hepatocellular carcinoma hcc associate hepatitis b hbv hepatitis c hcv well define however little know relationship surgical outcome serological hepatitis marker dual hbv hcv relate hcc retrospective data hcc hbv hcv coinfection undergo curative hepatectomy perform hbv dna quantification expression hbv antigen anti hcv signal cutoff ratio co clinicopathological characteristic investigate show potential relationship among surgical prognosis cox proportional hazard model identify hbv dna quantification iu ml high hbeag seropositivity size great cm multiple vascular invasion risk,b,Liver Cancer
"Calotropis gigantea stem bark extracts inhibit liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine. Several fractions of Calotropis gigantea extracts have been proposed to have potential anticancer activity in many cancer models. The present study evaluated the anticancer activity of C. gigantea stem bark extracts in liver cancer HepG2 cells and diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced primary liver cancer in rats. The carcinogenesis model induced by DEN administration has been widely used to study pathophysiological features and responses in rats that are comparable to those seen in cancer patients. The dichloromethane (CGDCM), ethyl acetate, and water fractions obtained from partitioning crude ethanolic extract were quantitatively analyzed for several groups of secondary metabolites and calactin contents. A combination of C. gigantea stem bark extracts with doxorubicin (DOX) was assessed in this study to demonstrate the enhanced cytotoxic effect to cancer compared to the single administration. The combination of DOX and CGDCM, which had the most potential cytotoxic effect in HepG2 cells when compared to the other three fractions, significantly increased cytotoxicity through the apoptotic effect with increased caspase-3 expression. This combination treatment also reduced ATP levels, implying a correlation between ATP and apoptosis induction. In a rat model of DEN-induced liver cancer, treatment with DOX, C. gigantea at low (CGDCM-L) and high (CGDCM-H) doses, and DOX + CGDCM-H for 4 weeks decreased the progression of liver cancer by lowering the liver weight/body weight ratio and the occurrence of liver hyperplastic nodules, fibrosis, and proliferative cells. The therapeutic applications lowered TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β, and α-SMA inflammatory cytokines in a similar way, implying that CGDCM had a curative effect against the inflammation-induced liver carcinogenesis produced by DEN exposure. Furthermore, CGDCM and DOX therapy decreased ATP and fatty acid synthesis in rat liver cancer, which was correlated with apoptosis inhibition. CGDCM reduced cleaved caspase-3 expression in liver cancer rats when used alone or in combination with DOX, implying that apoptosis-inducing hepatic carcinogenesis was suppressed. Our results also verified the low toxicity of CGDCM injection on the internal organs of rats. Thus, this research clearly demonstrated a promising, novel anticancer approach that could be applied in future clinical studies of CGDCM and combination therapy.","calotropis gigantea stem bark extracts inhibit liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine. several fractions of calotropis gigantea extracts have been proposed to have potential anticancer activity in many cancer models. the present study evaluated the anticancer activity of c. gigantea stem bark extracts in liver cancer hepg2 cells and diethylnitrosamine (den)-induced primary liver cancer in rats. the carcinogenesis model induced by den administration has been widely used to study pathophysiological features and responses in rats that are comparable to those seen in cancer patients. the dichloromethane (cgdcm), ethyl acetate, and water fractions obtained from partitioning crude ethanolic extract were quantitatively analyzed for several groups of secondary metabolites and calactin contents. a combination of c. gigantea stem bark extracts with doxorubicin (dox) was assessed in this study to demonstrate the enhanced cytotoxic effect to cancer compared to the single administration. the combination of dox and cgdcm, which had the most potential cytotoxic",calotropis gigantea stem bark extract inhibit liver induce diethylnitrosamine several fraction calotropis gigantea extract propose potential anticancer activity many model present evaluate anticancer activity c gigantea stem bark extract liver hepg cell diethylnitrosamine den induced primary liver rat carcinogenesis model induce den administration widely use pathophysiological feature response rat comparable see dichloromethane cgdcm ethyl acetate water fraction obtain partition crude ethanolic extract quantitatively analyze several group secondary metabolite calactin content combination c gigantea stem bark extract doxorubicin dox assess demonstrate enhanced cytotoxic effect compare single administration combination dox cgdcm potential cytotoxic,b,Liver Cancer

"Attitude of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials: empirical qualitative research. To explore the attitude of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials and promote the development of clinical drug trials in patients with liver cancer. Qualitative study. In this study conducted in a tertiary hospital, we conducted in-depth interviews in 19 patients with liver cancer, including those who were: (1) diagnosed with primary liver cancer according to the ""Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Liver Cancer (2022 Edition)""; (2) without cognitive or language impairment and were able to express their thoughts; and (3) willing to participate in the study and provided written informed consent. We excluded those with serious physical diseases or other malignant tumors and mental disorders. The attitudes of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials were evaluated along with the awareness of clinical drug trials and factors affecting their participation in order to promote the development of clinical drug trials for this population. We summarized the attitude of patients to clinical drug trials into two themes. The first involved differences in patients' awareness of clinical drug trials, which comprised lack of awareness, doubts and worries, blind trust in authoritative sources, and rational participation. The second highlighted factors influencing participation in clinical drug trials, which included: (1) positive factors such as a doctor's recommendation, expectations, peer effect, economic burden, desire to contribute to medical research, and family support, and (2) negative factors consisting of the side effects of drugs, drug safety, and problems guaranteeing patients' rights and interests. There are significant differences in liver cancer patients' awareness and attitudes towards clinical drug trials. Enhancing patient education and addressing their concerns can improve participation rates. Effective use of physician recommendations, financial incentives, and family support are crucial in encouraging patient involvement in clinical trials. Researchers should improve the awareness of liver cancer patients with regard to clinical drug trials and understand the factors that affect their participation. : The patients had no contributions in the design or conduct of the study, analysis or interpretation of the data, or in the preparation of the manuscript.","attitude of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials: empirical qualitative research. to explore the attitude of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials and promote the development of clinical drug trials in patients with liver cancer. qualitative study. in this study conducted in a tertiary hospital, we conducted in-depth interviews in 19 patients with liver cancer, including those who were: (1) diagnosed with primary liver cancer according to the ""guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of primary liver cancer (2022 edition)""; (2) without cognitive or language impairment and were able to express their thoughts; and (3) willing to participate in the study and provided written informed consent. we excluded those with serious physical diseases or other malignant tumors and mental disorders. the attitudes of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials were evaluated along with the awareness of clinical drug trials and factors affecting their participation",attitude liver toward drug trial empirical qualitative research explore attitude liver toward drug trial promote development drug trial liver qualitative conduct tertiary hospital conduct depth interview liver include diagnose primary liver accord guideline diagnosis primary liver edition without cognitive language impairment able express thought willing participate provide write informed consent exclude serious physical malignant mental disorder attitude liver toward drug trial evaluate along awareness drug trial factor affect participation,b,Liver Cancer
"Impact of CDX2 expression status on the survival of patients after curative resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis The prognostic biomarker for patients undergoing curative liver metastasectomy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is lacking. The purpose was to investigate the prognostic role of a lack of CDX2 expression, which has been proposed as a potential biomarker for high-risk relapse in early-stage CRC, in patients undergoing curative liver metastasectomy. A total of 396 consecutive patients with CRC liver metastasis who underwent potentially curative liver metastasectomy at a single center in Japan between 2005 and 2015 were included. For the immunohistochemical analysis of nuclear CDX2 expression, we adopted the tissue microarray approach using the resected metastatic liver CRCs. Patient subgroups were compared with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by applying the Kaplan-Meier curve, log-rank tests, and multivariate analyses based on the Cox proportional hazards method. OS is defined as the period from the date of curative liver resection for metastatic CRC until death. DFS is defined as the length of time from curative liver resection to either the first recurrence or death. In patients without recurrence, the latest imaging inspection date was used as the censored date. Thirty-six of the 396 CRCs (9.1%) reduced CDX2 expression. The reduced expression of CDX2 was associated with poor differentiation (P = 0.02). DFS in days was lower in the patients with CDX2-low CRC than in the patients with CDX2-high CRC (median DFS: 245 days versus 420 days; hazard ratio for disease recurrence: 1.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.08–2.38; P = 0.02). OS in days was lower in the patients with CDX2-low CRC than in the patients with CDX2-high CRC (median OS: 1024 days versus 3145 days; hazard ratio: 2.41; 95% confidence interval: 1.52–3.85; P <  0.001). In patients with CDX2-low CRC, both DFS and OS were similar between the with and without pre- or post-operative chemotherapy groups (median DFS: 243 versus 247 days; P = 0.73, median OS: 1016 versus 1363 days; P = 0.69).

"CDCA8 as an independent predictor for a poor prognosis in liver cancer Human cell division cycle associated 8 (CDCA8) a key regulator of mitosis, has been described as a potential prognostic biomarker for a variety of cancers, such as breast, colon and lung cancers. We aimed to evaluate the potential role of CDCA8 expression in the prognosis of liver cancer by analysing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the difference in CDCA8 expression between liver cancer tissues and matched normal tissues. Then, we applied logistic regression and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify the association between CDCA8 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics. Cox regression and the Kaplan–Meier method were used to examine the clinicopathologic features correlated with overall survival (OS) in patients from the TCGA. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore possible mechanisms of CDCA8 according to the TCGA dataset. CDCA8 expression was higher in liver cancer tissues than in matched normal tissues. Logistic regression and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed that the increased level of CDCA8 expression in liver cancer tissues was notably related to T stage (OR = 1.64 for T1/2 vs. T3/4), clinical stage (OR = 1.66 for I/II vs. III/IV), histologic grade (OR = 6.71 for G1 vs. G4) and histological type (OR = 0.24 for cholangiocarcinoma [CHOL] vs. hepatocellular carcinoma [LIHC]) (all P-values < 0.05). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that high CDCA8 expression was related to a poor prognosis in liver cancer (P = 2.456 × 10−6). Univariate analysis showed that high CDCA8 expression was associated with poor OS in liver cancer patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47–2.32; P = 1.16 × 10–7). Multivariate analysis showed that CDCA8 expression was independently correlated with OS (HR = 1.74; CI: 1.25–12.64; P = 1.27 × 10–5). GSEA revealed that the apoptosis, cell cycle, ErbB, MAPK, mTOR, Notch, p53 and TGF-β signaling pathways were differentially enriched in the CDCA8 high expression phenotype. High CDCA8 expression is a potential molecular predictor of a poor prognosis in liver cancer.","cdca8 as an independent predictor for a poor prognosis in liver cancer human cell division cycle associated 8 (cdca8) a key regulator of mitosis, has been described as a potential prognostic biomarker for a variety of cancers, such as breast, colon and lung cancers. we aimed to evaluate the potential role of cdca8 expression in the prognosis of liver cancer by analysing data from the cancer genome atlas (tcga). the wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the difference in cdca8 expression between liver cancer tissues and matched normal tissues. then, we applied logistic regression and the wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify the association between cdca8 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics. cox regression and the kaplan–meier method were used to examine the clinicopathologic features correlated with overall survival (os) in patients from the tcga. gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) was performed to explore possible mechanisms of cdca8 according to the tcga",cdca independent predictor poor prognosis liver human cell division cycle associate cdca key regulator mitosis describe potential prognostic biomarker variety breast colon lung evaluate potential role cdca expression prognosis liver analyse data genome atlas tcga wilcoxon rank sum test use compare difference cdca expression liver tissue match normal tissue apply logistic regression wilcoxon rank sum test identify association cdca expression clinicopathologic characteristic cox regression kaplan meier method use examine clinicopathologic feature correlate overall survival tcga gene set enrichment gsea perform explore possible mechanism cdca accord tcga,b,Liver Cancer
"Computational analysis for identification of early diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic biomarkers of liver cancer based on GEO and TCGA databases and studies on pathways and biological functions affecting the survival time of liver cancer Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer death. The purpose of this work is to find new diagnostic biomarkers or prognostic biomarkers and explore the biological functions related to the prognosis of liver cancer. GSE25097 datasets were firstly obtained and compared with TCGA LICA datasets and an analysis of the overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted. Cytoscape was used to screen out the Hub Genes among the DEGs. ROC curve analysis was used to screen the Hub Genes to determine the genes that could be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model screened genes associated with prognosis biomarkers, and further Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed on the prognosis genes to explore the mechanism affecting the survival and prognosis of liver cancer patients. 790 DEGs and 2162 DEGs were obtained respectively from the GSE25097 and TCGA LIHC data sets, and 102 Common DEGs were identified by overlapping the two DEGs. Further screening identified 22 Hub Genes from 102 Common DEGs. ROC and survival curves were used to analyze these 22 Hub Genes and it was found that there were 16 genes with a value of AUC > 90%. Among these, the expression levels of ESR1,SPP1 and FOSB genes were closely related to the survival time of liver cancer patients. Three common pathways of ESR1, FOBS and SPP1 genes were identified along with seven common pathways of ESR1 and SPP1 genes and four common pathways of ESR1 and FOSB genes.

"Granulocytic immune infiltrates are essential for the efficient formation of breast cancer liver metastases Breast cancer cells display preferences for specific metastatic sites including the bone, lung and liver. Metastasis is a complex process that relies, in part, on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and resident/infiltrating stromal cells that constitute the metastatic microenvironment. Distinct immune infiltrates can either impair the metastatic process or conversely, assist in the seeding, colonization and growth of disseminated cancer cells. Using in vivo selection approaches, we previously isolated 4T1-derived breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to these organs and tissues. In this study, we examined whether the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lung, liver or bone is associated with and dependent on distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. Immunohistocytochemistry and immunohistofluorescence approaches were used to quantify innate immune cell infiltrates within distinct metastases and depletion of Gr1+ (Ly-6C and Ly-6G) or specifically Ly-6G+ cells was performed to functionally interrogate the role of Ly-6G+ infiltrates in promoting metastasis to these organs. We show that T lymphocytes (CD3+), myeloid-derived (Gr-1+) cells and neutrophils (Ly-6G+ or NE+) exhibit the most pronounced recruitment in lung and liver metastases, with markedly less recruitment within bone metastatic lesions. Interestingly, these infiltrating cell populations display different patterns of localization within soft tissue metastases. T lymphocytes and granulocytic immune infiltrates are localized around the periphery of liver metastases whereas they were dispersed throughout the lung metastases. Furthermore, Gr-1+ cell-depletion studies demonstrate that infiltrating myeloid-derived cells are essential for the formation of breast cancer liver metastases but dispensable for metastasis to the lung and bone. A specific role for the granulocytic component of the innate immune infiltrate was revealed through Ly-6G+ cell-depletion experiments, which resulted in significantly impaired formation of liver metastases. Finally, we demonstrate that the CD11b+/Ly-6G+ neutrophils that infiltrate and surround the liver metastases are polarized toward an N2 phenotype, which have previously been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that the liver-metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is heavily reliant on interactions with infiltrating Ly-6G+ cells within the liver microenvironment.","granulocytic immune infiltrates are essential for the efficient formation of breast cancer liver metastases breast cancer cells display preferences for specific metastatic sites including the bone, lung and liver. metastasis is a complex process that relies, in part, on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and resident/infiltrating stromal cells that constitute the metastatic microenvironment. distinct immune infiltrates can either impair the metastatic process or conversely, assist in the seeding, colonization and growth of disseminated cancer cells. using in vivo selection approaches, we previously isolated 4t1-derived breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to these organs and tissues. in this study, we examined whether the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lung, liver or bone is associated with and dependent on distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. immunohistocytochemistry and immunohistofluorescence approaches were used to quantify innate immune cell infiltrates within distinct metastases and depletion of gr1+ (ly-6c and ly-6g) or",granulocytic immune infiltrates essential efficient formation breast liver metastases breast cell display preference specific metastatic site include bone lung liver metastasis complex process rely part interaction disseminated cell resident infiltrate stromal cell constitute metastatic microenvironment distinct immune infiltrates either impair metastatic process conversely assist seeding colonization growth disseminated cell use vivo selection approach previously isolate derive breast cell preferentially metastasize organ tissue examine whether propensity breast cell metastasize lung liver bone associate dependent distinct pattern immune cell infiltration immunohistocytochemistry immunohistofluorescence approach use quantify innate immune cell infiltrates within distinct metastasis depletion gr ly c ly g,b,Liver Cancer

"An age-period-cohort analysis of mortality rates for stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer among prefectures in Japan, 1999–2018 Although change in the birth cohort effect on cancer mortality rates is known to be highly associated with the decreasing rates of age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Japan, the differences in the trends of cohort effect for representative cancer types among the prefectures remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the decreasing rate of cohort effects among the prefectures for representative cancer types using age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Data on stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer mortality for each prefecture and the population data from 1999 to 2018 were obtained from the Vital Statistics in Japan. Mortality data for individuals aged 50 to 79 years grouped in 5-year increments were used, and corresponding birth cohorts born 1920–1924 through 1964–1978 were used for analysis. We estimated the effects of age, period, and cohort on each type of mortality rate for each prefecture by sex. Then, we calculated the decreasing rates of cohort effects for each prefecture. We also calculated the mortality rate ratio of each prefecture compared with all of Japan for cohorts using the estimates. As a result of APC analysis, we found that the decreasing rates of period effects were small and that there was a little difference in the decreasing rates among prefectures for all types of cancer among both sexes. On the other hand, there was a large difference in the decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer mortality rates among prefectures, particularly for men. For men, the decreasing rates of cohort effects in cohorts born between 1920–1924 and 1964–1978 varied among prefectures, ranging from 4.1 to 84.0% for stomach cancer and from 20.2 to 92.4% for liver cancers, respectively. On the other hand, the differences in the decreasing rates of cohort effects among prefectures for colorectal and lung cancer were relatively smaller. The decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer varied widely among prefectures. It is possible that this will influence cancer mortality rates in each prefecture in the future.","an age-period-cohort analysis of mortality rates for stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer among prefectures in japan, 1999–2018 although change in the birth cohort effect on cancer mortality rates is known to be highly associated with the decreasing rates of age-standardized cancer mortality rates in japan, the differences in the trends of cohort effect for representative cancer types among the prefectures remain unknown. this study aimed to investigate the differences in the decreasing rate of cohort effects among the prefectures for representative cancer types using age-period-cohort (apc) analysis. data on stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer mortality for each prefecture and the population data from 1999 to 2018 were obtained from the vital statistics in japan. mortality data for individuals aged 50 to 79 years grouped in 5-year increments were used, and corresponding birth cohorts born 1920–1924 through 1964–1978 were used for analysis. we estimated the effects of age, period,",age period cohort mortality rate stomach colorectal liver lung among prefecture japan although change birth cohort effect mortality rate know highly associate decrease rate age standardize mortality rate japan difference trend cohort effect representative type among prefecture remain unknown investigate difference decrease rate cohort effect among prefecture representative type use age period cohort apc data stomach colorectal liver lung mortality prefecture population data obtain vital statistic japan mortality data individual age year group year increment use correspond birth cohort bear use estimate effect age period,b,Liver Cancer

"A decade's studies on metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Metastasis remains one of the major challenges before hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is finally conquered. This paper summarized a decade’s studies on HCC metastasis at the Liver Cancer Institute of Fudan University. We have established a stepwise metastatic human HCC model system, which included a metastatic HCC model in nude mice (LCI-D20), a HCC cell line with high metastatic potential (MHCC97), a relatively low metastatic potential cell clone (MHCC97L) and several stepwise high metastatic potential cell clones (MHCC97H, HCCLM3, and HCCLM6) from their parent MHCC97 cell. Endeavors have been made for searching human HCC metastasis-related chromosomes/proteins/genes. Monogene-based studies revealed that HCC invasion/metastasis was similar to that of other solid tumors, and the biological characteristics of small HCC were only slightly better than that of large HCC. Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genotyping, cDNA microarray, and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we obtained some interesting results. In particular, in collaboration with the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States, we generated a molecular signature that can classify metastatic HCC patients, identified osteopontin as a lead gene in the signature, and found that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. We also found that chromosome 8p deletion, particularly in the region of 8p23, was associated with HCC metastasis. Cytokeratin 19 was identified as one of the proteins, which was found in MHCC97H, but not in MHCC97L cells. Experimental interventions using the high metastatic nude mice model have provided clues for the prevention of HCC metastasis. Translation from workbench to bedside demonstrated that serum VEGF, microvessel density, and p53 scoring may be of value for the prediction of postoperative metastatic recurrence. Interferon alpha proved effective for the prevention of recurrence both experimentally and clinically. In conclusion, HCC metastasis that probably initiated in the primary tumor is a multigene-involved, multistep, and changing process. The further elucidation of the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis will provide a more solid basis for the prediction and prevention of the metastatic recurrence of HCC.","a decade's studies on metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. metastasis remains one of the major challenges before hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is finally conquered. this paper summarized a decade’s studies on hcc metastasis at the liver cancer institute of fudan university. we have established a stepwise metastatic human hcc model system, which included a metastatic hcc model in nude mice (lci-d20), a hcc cell line with high metastatic potential (mhcc97), a relatively low metastatic potential cell clone (mhcc97l) and several stepwise high metastatic potential cell clones (mhcc97h, hcclm3, and hcclm6) from their parent mhcc97 cell. endeavors have been made for searching human hcc metastasis-related chromosomes/proteins/genes. monogene-based studies revealed that hcc invasion/metastasis was similar to that of other solid tumors, and the biological characteristics of small hcc were only slightly better than that of large hcc. using comparative genomic hybridization (cgh), fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), genotyping, cdna microarray, and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis,",decade metastasis hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis remain one major challenge hepatocellular carcinoma hcc finally conquer paper summarize decade hcc metastasis liver institute fudan university establish stepwise metastatic human hcc model system include metastatic hcc model nude mouse lci hcc cell line high metastatic potential mhcc relatively low metastatic potential cell clone mhcc l several stepwise high metastatic potential cell clone mhcc h hcclm hcclm parent mhcc cell endeavor make search human hcc metastasis relate chromosome proteins gene monogene base reveal hcc invasion metastasis similar solid biological characteristic small hcc slightly good large hcc use comparative genomic hybridization cgh fluorescence situ hybridization fish genotyping cdna microarray dimensional gel electrophoresis,b,Liver Cancer

A tissue microarray was employed to explore the relationship between CBX1 levels, patient prognosis, and clinicopathological characteristics in HCC. Various in vitro assays-including CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell invasion, and scratch tests-were conducted to assess the proliferative and motility properties of HCC cells upon modulation of CBX1 expression. Moreover, the functional impact of CBX1 on HCC was further discerned through xenograft studies in nude mice.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">CBX1 was found to be upregulated in most cancer forms, with heightened expression correlating with adverse patient prognoses. Within the context of HCC, elevated levels of CBX1 were consistently indicative of poorer clinical outcomes. Suppression of CBX1 through knockdown methodologies markedly diminished HCC cell proliferation, invasive capabilities, migratory activity, Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes, and resistance to Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Contrastingly, CBX1 augmentation facilitated the opposite effects. Subsequent investigative efforts revealed CBX1 to be a promoter of EMT and a contributor to increased TKI resistance within HCC cells, mediated via the IGF-1R/AKT/SNAIL signaling axis. The oncogenic activities of CBX1 proved to be attenuable either by AKT pathway inhibition or by targeted silencing of IGF-1R.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The broad overexpression of CBX1 in pan-cancer and specifically in HCC positions it as a putative oncogenic entity.

"Liver functional assessment using time-associated change in the liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio on enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: a retrospective study. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio (LSR) is evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the hepatobiliary phase and has been reported as a useful radiological assessment of regional liver function. However, LSR is a passive (non-time-associated) assessment of liver function, not a dynamic (time-associated) assessment. Moreover, LSR shows limitations such as a dose bias of contrast medium and a timing bias of imaging. Previous studies have reported the advantages of time-associated liver functional assessment as a precise assessment of liver function. For instance, the indocyanine green (ICG) disappearance rate, which is calculated from serum ICG concentrations at multiple time points, reflects a precise preoperative liver function for predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure without the dose bias of ICG or the timing bias of blood sampling.

"Spatial epidemiologic analysis of the liver cancer and gallbladder cancer incidence and its determinants in South Korea. Background There have been reports on regional variation in prevalence of hepatitis B and C, and Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection, which indicates potential of spatial variation in liver cancer and gallbladder cancer incidence in Korea. Therefore, we aimed to assess the regional variation of liver and gallbladder cancer incidence and its determinants based on the regional distribution of risk factors, including hepatitis B infection in Korea. Methods This study used an ecological study design and district-level cancer incidence statistics generated by the National Cancer Center. Spatial clusters of liver and gallbladder cancer incidence were detected based on spatial scan statistics using SaTScan™ software. We set the size of maximum spatial scanning window of 25 and 35% of the population at risk for analyses of liver and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Significance level of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis of no cluster. We fitted the Besag-York-Mollie model using integrated nested Laplace approximations to assess factors that influence the regional variation in cancer incidence. Results Spatial clusters with high liver cancer incidence rates were detected in the southwestern and southeastern regions of Korea. High gallbladder cancer incidence rates are clustered in the southeastern region. Regional liver cancer incidence can be accounted for the prevalence of high household income (coefficient, - 0.10; 95% credible interval [CI], - 0.18 to - 0.02), marital status (coefficient, - 0.14; 95% CI, - 0.25 to - 0.03), the incidence of hepatitis B (coefficient, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.44), and liver cancer screening (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.12), while gallbladder cancer incidence was related to the prevalence of high household income (coefficient, - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.05 to 0.00) and living close to a river with a high prevalence of liver fluke infection (coefficient, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.96).

We planned the current study to review our experience on this matter and compare short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and open liver resection (OLR) in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). Materials and methods This is a single-center retrospective analysis of patients with CRLM who underwent laparoscopic (n=86) and open (n=96) surgical treatment for metastatic liver lesions between March 2016 and November 2022. Tumor characteristics, intra- and postoperative results, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed and compared. Results LLR was associated with significantly shorter surgery duration (180 minutes versus 295 minutes, p=0.03). There was no significant difference in blood loss between the two groups (100 mL versus 350 mL, p=0.061). Additionally, the laparoscopic approach was associated with significantly shorter hospital stays (6 days versus 9 days, p=0.004). The rate of major complications (Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 3) was lower in the LLR group (5.8% versus 16.6%, p=0.037). There was no mortality in the LLR group, and in the OLR group, one lethal case was induced by mesenteric thrombosis on the fifth postoperative day. We did not find a statistically significant difference in the OS rate between the two groups at one, three, and five years: 97.3%, 74.7%, and 43.4%, respectively, in the OLR group and 95.1%, 70.3%, and 49.5%, respectively, in the LLR group (p=0.53).

"Promising practices for the prevention of liver cancer: a review of the literature and cancer plan activities in the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of primary liver cancer, and are most prevalent in people born 1945–1965. Relatively little information is available for liver cancer prevention, compared to other cancers. In this review, we provide a summary of current promising public health practices for liver cancer prevention from the literature, as well as liver cancer-related initiatives in the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP). Two types of source materials were analyzed for this review: published literature (2005-present), and current cancer plans from the NCCCP (2005–2022). A search strategy was developed to include a review of several scientific databases. Of the 73 articles identified as potentially eligible, 20 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Eligible articles were abstracted using a data abstraction tool. Three independent keyword searches on 65 NCCCP plans were conducted. Keyword searches within each of the plans to identify activities related to liver cancer were conducted. Relevant information was abstracted from the plans and saved in a data table. Of the 20 eligible articles, 15 articles provided information on interventions related to liver cancer and hepatitis B or hepatitis C prevention. All 15 of the intervention articles were related to hepatitis; 13 were hepatitis B-focused, two were hepatitis C-focused, and 14 focused on Asian/Pacific Islander American populations. The independent keyword search of NCCCP plans produced 46 results for liver, 27 results for hepatitis, and 52 results for alcohol. Two plans included activities related to liver cancer. Twenty-four plans included activities related to hepatitis. A majority of the intervention articles published focused on HBV infection in Asian/Pacific Islander American populations, and a small percentage of NCCCP plans included liver-related content. The findings from this review will inform the development of an Action Plan on liver cancer prevention for the NCCCP, which will assist programs with the adoption and uptake of promising practices for the prevention of liver cancer.","promising practices for the prevention of liver cancer: a review of the literature and cancer plan activities in the national comprehensive cancer control program. hepatitis b virus (hbv) and hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of primary liver cancer, and are most prevalent in people born 1945–1965. relatively little information is available for liver cancer prevention, compared to other cancers. in this review, we provide a summary of current promising public health practices for liver cancer prevention from the literature, as well as liver cancer-related initiatives in the national comprehensive cancer control program (ncccp). two types of source materials were analyzed for this review: published literature (2005-present), and current cancer plans from the ncccp (2005–2022). a search strategy was developed to include a review of several scientific databases. of the 73 articles identified as potentially eligible, 20 articles were eligible for inclusion in",promising practice prevention liver review literature plan activity national comprehensive control program hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis c virus hcv infection risk factor hepatocellular carcinoma type primary liver prevalent people bear relatively little information available liver prevention compare review provide summary current promise public health practice liver prevention literature well liver relate initiative national comprehensive control program ncccp two type source material analyze review publish literature present current plan ncccp search strategy develop include review several scientific database article identify potentially eligible article eligible inclusion,b,Liver Cancer

"Risk factors, prognostic factors, and nomograms for liver metastasis in stage Tis-T2 colorectal cancer patients from a population-based study. Liver metastasis(LM) is the primary cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. The incidence of liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer is uncommon, and there is limited research available. While nomograms have been increasingly utilized in oncology, there is a lack of studies focusing on the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer. The data of patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the independent risk factors for liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer. Additionally, both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to determine the independent prognostic factors in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer who had liver metastasis. Subsequently, two nomograms were developed and the results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 11,116 patients diagnosed with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer were studied, among whom 190 (1.71%) developed liver metastasis. The identified independent risk factors for liver metastasis in these patients included age, sex, primary tumor size, serum CEA levels, N stage, and histological type. Furthermore, sex, race, primary tumor size, serum CEA levels, and chemotherapy were found to be independent factors influencing the prognosis of patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer who developed liver metastasis. The accuracy of predicting the risk and prognosis of liver metastasis in these patients was confirmed through various analyses such as ROC curves, calibration curves, DCA curves, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves on both training and validation sets using two nomograms. The two nomograms are considered effective tools for predicting the risk of liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer, as well as predicting the prognosis of patients with liver metastasis.

"Prospective study of early detection for primary liver cancer. Purpose: To determine whether repeated screening can lead to early detection of primary liver cancer (PLC) and in turn to an improved clinical result.Methods: In this randomized controlled study, Shanghai urban residents aged 35–55 years and with serum evidence of HBV infection or chronic liver disease were eligible for recruitment. Using cluster sampling, these subjects were allocated into two groups — the screening group and the control group: there were 8109 subjects in the screening group and 9711 in the control group. Subjects in the screening group were tested with serum AFP and real-time ultrasound every 6 months. One to four rounds of screening were completed. Liver cancer was treated according to stage at diagnosis.Results: All subjects enrolled were followed up and classed at the end-point as alive without liver cancer, alive with liver cancer, dead from liver cancer, or dead from another cause. The mean follow-up was 1.2 years; total followup was 12,038 person-years in the screening group and 9,573 person-years in the control group. We detected 38 patients with PLC in the screening group and 18 patients with PLC in the control group. In the patients in the screening group 76.8% of patients were at a subclinical stage, and 70.6% of them underwent resection, the 1- and 2-year survival rates being 88.1% and 77.5%, respectively. However, in the control group, none of the patients was at a subclinical stage when diagnosed, none of them underwent resection, and none of them survived over 1 year. The lead time was estimated at 0.45 years. The cost of detecting PLC at an early stage was RMB 12,600 (US$ 1,500).Conclusion: The study proved that screening the high-risk population for PLC with a serum AFP test and real-time ultrasound examination can detect patients in the early stages, increase the resection rate and prolong the survival time. It is therefore recommended that screening for PLC be advocated in any high-risk area.","prospective study of early detection for primary liver cancer. purpose: to determine whether repeated screening can lead to early detection of primary liver cancer (plc) and in turn to an improved clinical result.methods: in this randomized controlled study, shanghai urban residents aged 35–55 years and with serum evidence of hbv infection or chronic liver disease were eligible for recruitment. using cluster sampling, these subjects were allocated into two groups — the screening group and the control group: there were 8109 subjects in the screening group and 9711 in the control group. subjects in the screening group were tested with serum afp and real-time ultrasound every 6 months. one to four rounds of screening were completed. liver cancer was treated according to stage at diagnosis.results: all subjects enrolled were followed up and classed at the end-point as alive without liver cancer, alive with liver cancer, dead from liver cancer, or dead",prospective early detection primary liver determine whether repeated screening lead early detection primary liver plc turn improved result method randomize control shanghai urban resident age year serum evidence hbv infection chronic liver eligible recruitment use cluster sample subject allocate two group screen group control group subject screening group control group subject screening group test serum afp real time ultrasound every month one four round screen complete liver treat accord stage diagnosis result subject enrol follow class end point alive without liver alive liver dead liver dead,b,Liver Cancer
"Blocking and reversing hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated by traditional Chinese medicine (tablets of biejia ruangan or RGT): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Background: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ultimately liver-related death. Although oral antiviral therapy for patients with CHB reduces the risk of such complications, once cirrhosis is established, the benefits of antiviral therapy are not robustly demonstrated. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), some Chinese herbal medicines promote blood circulation and soften hard masses, and therefore they may block and reverse hepatic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of TCM tablets of the compound biejia ruangan (RGT) administered for fibrosis, and entecavir (ETV), on the development of HCC in patients with CHB or hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related compensated cirrhosis. Methods/design: This multicenter, centrally randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study is planned to complete within 5 years. For the study, 1,000 with CHB or HBV-related compensated cirrhosis are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a treatment group (0.5 mg ETV once daily; 2 g RGT three times daily) or a control group (0.5 mg ETV once daily; 2 g RGT dummy agent three times daily). The primary end points are the development of HCC and liver-related death. Secondary end points include disease progression and overall survival. Discussion: Although antiviral therapy can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication, thereby preventing cirrhosis, patients with CHB treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) retain a higher risk for HCC compared with patients with inactive disease. Although previous clinical trials with RGT have confirmed the efficacy of blocking and reversing hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHB or compensated cirrhosis, the long-term risk for HCC or disease progression in these patients treated with combination of RGT and NUCs compared with NUCs alone is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of the RGT blockade and reversal of hepatic fibrosis on the development of HCC in patients with CHB or HBV-related compensated cirrhosis in large, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in China.","blocking and reversing hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis b treated by traditional chinese medicine (tablets of biejia ruangan or rgt): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. background: chronic hepatitis b (chb) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and ultimately liver-related death. although oral antiviral therapy for patients with chb reduces the risk of such complications, once cirrhosis is established, the benefits of antiviral therapy are not robustly demonstrated. according to traditional chinese medicine (tcm), some chinese herbal medicines promote blood circulation and soften hard masses, and therefore they may block and reverse hepatic fibrosis. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of tcm tablets of the compound biejia ruangan (rgt) administered for fibrosis, and entecavir (etv), on the development of hcc in patients with chb or hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related compensated cirrhosis. methods/design: this multicenter, centrally randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study is planned",block reverse hepatic fibrosis chronic hepatitis b treat traditional chinese medicine tablet biejia ruangan rgt protocol randomize control trial chronic hepatitis b chb progress cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma hcc ultimately liver relate death although oral antiviral therapy chb reduces risk complication cirrhosis establish benefit antiviral therapy robustly demonstrate accord traditional chinese medicine tcm chinese herbal medicine promote blood circulation soften hard mass therefore may block reverse hepatic fibrosis evaluate effect tcm tablet compound biejia ruangan rgt administer fibrosis entecavir etv development hcc chb hepatitis b virus hbv relate compensated cirrhosis method design multicenter centrally randomize double blind placebo control parallel group plan,b,Liver Cancer

The loss of cNFIB was highly associated with aggressive characteristics and predicted unfavorable prognosis in ICC patients.

"Non-hepatic Cancers Independently Predict Liver Decompensation Events Advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis represent independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is also evidence suggesting that several etiologies of chronic liver disease elevate the risk for non-hepatic cancers, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol abuse, and hepatitis C infection. In the present study, we aim to characterize the cancer incidence in patients with chronic liver disease and assess the prognostic value of non-hepatic cancer on the decompensation events of this population. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who underwent transient elastography (TE) of liver, at John H. Stroger Hospital in Cook County, Chicago, IL. We identified patients who had decompensation of cirrhosis. We also extracted their cancer history. The cancer profiles of the cohort were compared by the presence or absence of advanced liver fibrosis. We then performed univariate and multivariate forward stepwise Cox regression analysis to identify the significant risk factors for the decompensation events and plotted Kaplan-Meier curve to demonstrate the significance of cancer in the prediction of decompensation events. We identified a total of 3097 patients who underwent TE. A total of 45 liver decompensation events were documented. In the univariate Cox regression model, MELD-Na score (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25, p < 0.001), liver stiffness measurement (HR 1.05, p = 0.004), and history of any cancer (HR 3.81, p = 0.001) emerged as predictors of decompensation. Non-hepatic cancer proved to be a significant predictor of decompensation (HR 3.57, p = 0.002). The present study represents the first attempt to the best of our knowledge to describe the cancer incidence in this high-risk population. We found that non-HCC cancers independently predict hepatic decompensation events, which is an intriguing finding. We propose that physicians should be more vigilant to cancer history of patients with chronic liver disease as it might provide valuable prognostic information and guide individualized treatment and surveillance plans.","non-hepatic cancers independently predict liver decompensation events advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis represent independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). there is also evidence suggesting that several etiologies of chronic liver disease elevate the risk for non-hepatic cancers, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld), alcohol abuse, and hepatitis c infection. in the present study, we aim to characterize the cancer incidence in patients with chronic liver disease and assess the prognostic value of non-hepatic cancer on the decompensation events of this population. we retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who underwent transient elastography (te) of liver, at john h. stroger hospital in cook county, chicago, il. we identified patients who had decompensation of cirrhosis. we also extracted their cancer history. the cancer profiles of the cohort were compared by the presence or absence of advanced liver fibrosis. we then performed univariate and multivariate forward stepwise cox regression analysis",non hepatic independently predict liver decompensation event advance liver fibrosis cirrhosis represent independent risk factor hepatocellular carcinoma hcc also evidence suggest several etiology chronic liver elevate risk non hepatic include nonalcoholic fatty liver nafld alcohol abuse hepatitis c infection present characterize incidence chronic liver assess prognostic value non hepatic decompensation event population retrospectively review electronic medical record undergo transient elastography te liver john h stroger hospital cook county chicago il identify decompensation cirrhosis also extract history profile cohort compare presence absence advanced liver fibrosis perform univariate multivariate forward stepwise cox regression,b,Liver Cancer
"Preoperative classification of primary and metastatic liver cancer via machine learning-based ultrasound radiomics. To investigate the application of machine learning–based ultrasound radiomics in preoperative classification of primary and metastatic liver cancer. Data of 114 consecutive histopathologically confirmed patients with liver cancer from January 2018 to November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent liver ultrasonography within 1 week before hepatectomy or fine-needle biopsy. The liver lesions were manually segmented by two experts using ITK-SNAP software. Seven categories of radiomics features, including first-order, two-dimensional shape, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, gray-level run-length matrix, gray-level size-zone matrix, neighboring gray tone difference matrix, and gray-level dependence matrix, were extracted on the Pyradiomics platform. Fourteen filters were applied to the original images, and derived images were obtained. Then, the dimensions of radiomics features were reduced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method. Finally, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to distinguish primary liver cancer from metastatic liver cancer by a fivefold cross-validation strategy. The performance of the established model was mainly evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and accuracy. One thousand four hundred nine radiomics features were extracted from the original images and/or derived images for each patient. The mentioned five machine learning classifiers were able to differentiate primary liver cancer from metastatic liver cancer. LR outperformed other classifiers, with the accuracy of 0.843 ± 0.078 (AUC, 0.816 ± 0.088; sensitivity, 0.768 ± 0.232; specificity, 0.880 ± 0.117).

"Matrix stiffness-upregulated LOXL2 promotes fibronectin production, MMP9 and CXCL12 expression and BMDCs recruitment to assist pre-metastatic niche formation. Higher matrix stiffness affects biological behavior of tumor cells, regulates tumor-associated gene/miRNA expression and stemness characteristic, and contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the linkage between higher matrix stiffness and pre-metastatic niche in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still largely unknown. We comparatively analyzed the expressions of LOX family members in HCC cells grown on different stiffness substrates, and speculated that the secreted LOXL2 may mediate the linkage between higher matrix stiffness and pre-metastatic niche. Subsequently, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism by which matrix stiffness induced LOXL2 expression in HCC cells, and explored the effects of LOXL2 on pre-metastatic niche formation, such as BMCs recruitment, fibronectin production, MMPs and CXCL12 expression, cell adhesion, etc. Higher matrix stiffness significantly upregulated LOXL2 expression in HCC cells, and activated JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway. Knockdown of integrin β1 and α5 suppressed LOXL2 expression and reversed the activation of above signaling pathway. Additionally, JNK inhibitor attenuated the expressions of p-JNK, p-c-JUN, c-JUN and LOXL2, and shRNA-c-JUN also decreased LOXL2 expression. CM-LV-LOXL2-OE and rhLOXL2 upregulated MMP9 expression and fibronectin production obviously in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, activation of Akt pathway contributed to LOXL2-induced fibronectin upregulation. LOXL2 in CM as chemoattractant increased motility and invasion of BMCs, implicating a significant role of LOXL2 in BMCs recruitment. Except that, CM-LV-LOXL2-OE as chemoattractant also increased the number of migrated HCC cells, and improved chemokine CXCL12 expression in lung fibroblasts. The number of HCC cells adhered to surface of lung fibroblasts treated with CM-LV-LOXL2-OE was remarkably higher than that of the control cells. These results indicated that the secreted LOXL2 facilitated the motility of HCC cells and strengthened CTCs settlement on the remodeled matrix “soil”.

"Cancer Burden Variations and Convergences in Globalization: A Comparative Study on the Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung (TBL) and Liver Cancer Burdens Among WHO Regions from 1990 to 2019. Lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, respectively. Both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. A thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, especially the convergences and variations among WHO regions, is useful in precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) database were analyzed to evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer and liver cancer. Western Pacific Region (WPR) had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] per 100,000 population) and TBL cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000 population) in 2019. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for liver and TBL cancer elevated with the increasing sociodemographic index (SDI) level, except for liver cancer in WPR and TBL cancer in European Region (EUR). Region of the Americas (AMR) showed the biggest upward trends of liver cancer age-standardized rates (ASRs), as well as the biggest downward trends of TBL cancer ASRs, followed by Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Alcohol use and smoking were the leading cause of liver and TBL cancer death in most WHO regions. Variances of ASRs for liver and TBL cancer among WHO memberships have been decreasing during the past decade. The homogenization and convergence of cancer burdens were also demonstrated in different agegroups and sexes and in the evolution of associated risk factors and etiology. In conclusion, our study reflects the variations and convergences in the liver and lung cancer burdens among the WHO regions with the developing globalization, which suggests that we need to be acutely aware of the global homogeneity of the disease burden that accompanies increasing globalization, including the global convergences in various populations, risk factors, and burden metrics.","cancer burden variations and convergences in globalization: a comparative study on the tracheal, bronchus, and lung (tbl) and liver cancer burdens among who regions from 1990 to 2019. lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, respectively. both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. a thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, especially the convergences and variations among who regions, is useful in precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. the global burden of disease (gbd) and who global health observatory (gho) database were analyzed to evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung (tbl) cancer and liver cancer. western pacific region (wpr) had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (asir) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] per 100,000 population) and tbl cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000",burden variation convergence globalization comparative tracheal bronchus lung tbl liver burden among region lung liver leading third cause death respectively lung liver clear major risk factor thorough understanding burden context globalization especially convergence variation among region useful precision prevention worldwide understand change epidemiological trend expand globalization global burden gbd global health observatory gho database analyze evaluate burden metric risk factor trachea bronchus lung tbl liver western pacific region wpr high age standardize incidence rate asir liver per population tbl per,b,Liver Cancer

"Single-cell analysis uncovers liver susceptibility to pancreatic cancer metastasis via myeloid cell characterization. The liver is the predominant metastatic site for diverse cancers, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (CRC), etc. The high incidence of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer is an important reason for its refractory and high mortality. Therefore, it is important to understand how metastatic pancreatic cancer affects the hepatic tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in patients. Here, we characterized the TME of liver metastases unique to pancreatic cancer by comparing them with CRC liver metastases. We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets including tumor samples of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis (P-LM), colorectal cancer liver metastasis (C-LM), primary pancreatic cancer (PP), primary colorectal cancer (PC), as well as samples of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC), adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (NPT), to better characterize the heterogeneities of the microenvironment of two kinds of liver metastases. We next performed comparative analysis on cellular compositions between P-LM and C-LM, found that Mph_SPP1, a subset of macrophages associated with angiogenesis and tumor invasion, was more enriched in the P-LM group, indicating this kind of macrophages provide a TME niche more vulnerable for pancreatic cancers. Analysis of the developmental trajectory implied that Mph_SPP1 may progressively be furnished with increased expression of genes regulating endothelium. Cell-cell communications analysis revealed that Mph_SPP1 potentially interacts with endothelial cells in P-LM via FN1/SPP1-ITGAV/ITGB1, implying this macrophage subset may construct an immunosuppressive TME for pancreatic cancer by regulating endothelial cells. We also found that Mph_SPP1 has a prognostic value in pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is not present in colon adenocarcinoma or rectum adenocarcinoma. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the characteristics of the hepatic TME in patients with liver metastatic cancer. And it provides a subset of macrophages specifically associated with the liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and its detection and intervention have potential value for preventing the metastasis of pancreatic cancer to the liver.","single-cell analysis uncovers liver susceptibility to pancreatic cancer metastasis via myeloid cell characterization. the liver is the predominant metastatic site for diverse cancers, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (crc), etc. the high incidence of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer is an important reason for its refractory and high mortality. therefore, it is important to understand how metastatic pancreatic cancer affects the hepatic tumor immune microenvironment (tme) in patients. here, we characterized the tme of liver metastases unique to pancreatic cancer by comparing them with crc liver metastases. we integrated two single-cell rna-seq (scrna-seq) datasets including tumor samples of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis (p-lm), colorectal cancer liver metastasis (c-lm), primary pancreatic cancer (pp), primary colorectal cancer (pc), as well as samples of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (pbmc), adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (npt), to better characterize the heterogeneities of the microenvironment of two kinds of liver metastases. we next performed comparative analysis",single cell uncovers liver susceptibility pancreatic metastasis via myeloid cell characterization liver predominant metastatic site diverse include pancreatic colorectal crc etc high incidence hepatic metastasis pancreatic important reason refractory high mortality therefore important understand metastatic pancreatic affect hepatic immune microenvironment tme characterize tme liver metastasis unique pancreatic compare crc liver metastases integrate two single cell rna seq scrna seq datasets include sample pancreatic liver metastasis p lm colorectal liver metastasis c lm primary pancreatic pp primary colorectal pc well sample peripheral blood mono nuclear cell pbmc adjacent normal pancreatic tissue npt well characterize heterogeneity microenvironment two kind liver metastasis next perform comparative,b,Liver Cancer
"Operative and short-term oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for colorectal liver metastases located in the posterosuperior liver: a propensity score matching analysis. Laparoscopic resection (LLR) of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) located in the posterosuperior liver (segments 4a, 7, and 8) is challenging but has become more practical recently due to progress in operative techniques. We aimed to compare tumor-specific, perioperative, and short-term oncological outcomes after LLR and open liver resection (OLR) for CRLM. Patients who underwent curative resection of CRLM with at least 1 tumor in the posterosuperior liver during 2012–2015 were analyzed. Tumor-specific factors associated with the adoption of LLR were analyzed by logistic regression model. One-to-one propensity score matching was used to match baseline characteristics between patients with LLR and OLR. The original cohort included 30 patients with LLR and 239 with OLR. Median follow-up time was 23.8 months. Logistic regression analysis showed that multiple, diameter ≥30 mm, deep location, and closeness to major vessels were associated with OLR. None of the 24 patients with none or one of these factors were converted from LLR to OLR. After matching, 29 patients with LLR and 29 with OLR were analyzed. The 2 groups had similar preoperative factors. The LLR and OLR groups did not differ with respect to operative time, intraoperative bleeding, incidence of blood transfusion, surgical margin positivity, incidence of postoperative complications, and unplanned readmission within 45 days. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for LLR versus OLR (4 days [1–12] vs. 5 days [4–18]; p = 0.0003). Median recurrence-free survival was similar for patients who underwent LLR versus OLR (10.6 months for LLR vs. 13.4 months for OLR; p = 0.87). Compared to OLR, LLR of posterosuperior CRLM is associated with significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay but otherwise similar perioperative and short-term oncological outcomes. Tumor-specific factors associated with safe and routine LLR approach despite challenging location are superficial, solitary, and small (<30 mm) CRLM not associated with major vessels.","operative and short-term oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for colorectal liver metastases located in the posterosuperior liver: a propensity score matching analysis. laparoscopic resection (llr) of colorectal liver metastases (crlm) located in the posterosuperior liver (segments 4a, 7, and 8) is challenging but has become more practical recently due to progress in operative techniques. we aimed to compare tumor-specific, perioperative, and short-term oncological outcomes after llr and open liver resection (olr) for crlm. patients who underwent curative resection of crlm with at least 1 tumor in the posterosuperior liver during 2012–2015 were analyzed. tumor-specific factors associated with the adoption of llr were analyzed by logistic regression model. one-to-one propensity score matching was used to match baseline characteristics between patients with llr and olr. the original cohort included 30 patients with llr and 239 with olr. median follow-up time was 23.8 months. logistic regression analysis showed that multiple,",operative short term oncologic outcome laparoscopic versus open liver resection colorectal liver metastasis locate posterosuperior liver propensity score matching laparoscopic resection llr colorectal liver metastasis crlm locate posterosuperior liver segment challenge become practical recently due progress operative technique compare specific perioperative short term oncological outcome llr open liver resection olr crlm undergo curative resection crlm least posterosuperior liver analyze specific factor associate adoption llr analyze logistic regression model one one propensity score matching use match baseline characteristic llr olr original cohort include llr olr median follow time month logistic regression show multiple,b,Liver Cancer

"Complete remission of multiple liver metastases with only partial response of the primary rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Colorectal cancer is commonly diagnosed among the Japanese population, and various strategies in treating the colorectal liver metastasis have been introduced over the years. Here, we present a case of colorectal liver metastases in which we devised a multidisciplinary treatment plan for a better prognosis. We report a case of a 44-year-old female who developed rectal cancer with advanced synchronous liver metastases and was treated by a liver-first surgical approach following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At diagnosis, there were 12 bilobular lesions in the liver, and the primary rectal cancer was asymptomatic and unprogressive. We adopted a liver-first strategy because the control of the liver metastases was considered the key prognostic factor. Furthermore, because the lesions were highly progressive, we planned neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy first to provide an observational period to identify potential new metastatic lesions that were refractory to systemic chemotherapy or contraindicative for surgical resection. We administered two courses of S-1 + oxaliplatin (SOX)+ bevacizumab (BV) and an additional course of SOX without BV as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in preparation for surgery. This resulted in a prominent minimalization of colorectal liver metastases, and no other remote metastasis was observed. Then, surgical resection of the colorectal liver metastases was performed safely, and the pathological result revealed complete remission of all tumors by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary tumor in the colon was successfully resected 2 months after the hepatectomy. Although the patient experienced a recurrence in two different sites in the lungs 10 months after resection of the primary rectal lesion, these metastases were successfully resected after diagnosis. The patient is alive with no signs of recurrence 3 years after the diagnosis of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases. The combination of a liver-first strategy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a possible treatment of choice to cure colorectal cancer with simultaneous advanced colorectal liver metastases.","complete remission of multiple liver metastases with only partial response of the primary rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. colorectal cancer is commonly diagnosed among the japanese population, and various strategies in treating the colorectal liver metastasis have been introduced over the years. here, we present a case of colorectal liver metastases in which we devised a multidisciplinary treatment plan for a better prognosis. we report a case of a 44-year-old female who developed rectal cancer with advanced synchronous liver metastases and was treated by a liver-first surgical approach following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. at diagnosis, there were 12 bilobular lesions in the liver, and the primary rectal cancer was asymptomatic and unprogressive. we adopted a liver-first strategy because the control of the liver metastases was considered the key prognostic factor. furthermore, because the lesions were highly progressive, we planned neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy first to provide an observational period to identify potential new",complete remission multiple liver metastasis partial response primary rectal neoadjuvant chemotherapy colorectal commonly diagnose among japanese population various strategy treat colorectal liver metastasis introduce year present colorectal liver metastasis devise multidisciplinary plan good prognosis report year old female develop rectal advanced synchronous liver metastasis treat liver first surgical approach follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy diagnosis bilobular lesion liver primary rectal asymptomatic unprogressive adopt liver first strategy control liver metastasis consider key prognostic factor furthermore lesion highly progressive plan neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy first provide observational period identify potential new,b,Liver Cancer

"Laparoscopic hepatectomy enhances recovery for small hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis by postoperative inflammatory response attenuation: a propensity score matching analysis with a conventional open approach. The concurrent presence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a challenge for laparoscopic surgeons to establish a routine practice. The aim of this study was to gather evidence and produce recommendations on the safe and effective practice of laparoscopic hepatectomy for patients with solitary HCC (≤ 5 cm) and liver cirrhosis. Between October 2013 and October 2014, 356 curative hepatectomies were performed for patients pathologically diagnosed with solitary HCC (≤ 5 cm) accompanied by cirrhosis (stage 4 fibrosis). To overcome selection bias, a 1:2 match using propensity score matching analysis was conducted between laparoscopic and open hepatectomy. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the groups, including hospitalization, operation time, blood loss, and surgical complications. Perioperative inflammation-based markers, including systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were collected from medical records and analyzed. There were 43 and 77 patients in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively. The laparoscopic group had less hepatic inflow occlusion (16.3% vs. 61%; P < 0.001), shorter operation time (155 vs. 170 min; P = 0.004), and shorter postoperative hospital stay (4 vs. 7 days; P < 0.001). Although the difference was not significant (P = 0.154), the rate of postoperative complications tended to be lower in the laparoscopic group (2.3%) compared with the open group (9.1%). The increase in postoperative SII, NLR, and LMR for laparoscopic hepatectomy were significantly lower than for open hepatectomy. NLR < 5.8 on postoperative day 3 was significantly correlated with shorter hospital stay (P < 0.001). Compared with open hepatectomy, laparoscopic hepatectomy for selected HCC patients, even in the presence of cirrhosis, might result in better perioperative outcomes and postoperative inflammatory response attenuation, and ultimately promote faster recovery. This provides evidence for considering routine laparoscopic hepatectomy through careful selection of patients with HCC.","laparoscopic hepatectomy enhances recovery for small hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis by postoperative inflammatory response attenuation: a propensity score matching analysis with a conventional open approach. the concurrent presence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) poses a challenge for laparoscopic surgeons to establish a routine practice. the aim of this study was to gather evidence and produce recommendations on the safe and effective practice of laparoscopic hepatectomy for patients with solitary hcc (≤ 5 cm) and liver cirrhosis. between october 2013 and october 2014, 356 curative hepatectomies were performed for patients pathologically diagnosed with solitary hcc (≤ 5 cm) accompanied by cirrhosis (stage 4 fibrosis). to overcome selection bias, a 1:2 match using propensity score matching analysis was conducted between laparoscopic and open hepatectomy. perioperative outcomes were compared between the groups, including hospitalization, operation time, blood loss, and surgical complications. perioperative inflammation-based markers, including systemic immune-inflammation index (sii), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte",laparoscopic hepatectomy enhance recovery small hepatocellular carcinoma liver cirrhosis postoperative inflammatory response attenuation propensity score matching conventional open approach concurrent presence liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma hcc pose challenge laparoscopic surgeon establish routine practice gather evidence produce recommendation safe effective practice laparoscopic hepatectomy solitary hcc cm liver cirrhosis october october curative hepatectomies perform pathologically diagnose solitary hcc cm accompany cirrhosis stage fibrosis overcome selection bias match use propensity score matching conduct laparoscopic open hepatectomy perioperative outcome compare group include hospitalization operation time blood loss surgical complication perioperative inflammation base marker include systemic immune inflammation index sii neutrophil lymphocyte,b,Liver Cancer

"GRP78 as a regulator of liver steatosis and cancer progression mediated by loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a molecular chaperone widely elevated in human cancers, is critical for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding, stress signaling and PI3K/AKT activation. Genetic knockout models of GRP78 revealed that GRP78 maintains homeostasis of metabolic organs, including liver, pancreas and adipose tissues. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) are the most common liver cancers. There is a lack of effective therapeutics for HCC and CC, highlighting the need to further understand liver tumorigenic mechanisms. PTEN (phosphatase and tenson homolog deleted on chromosome 10), a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the PI3K/AKT pathway, is inactivated in a wide range of tumors, including 40-50% of human liver cancers. To elucidate the role of GRP78 in liver cancer, we created a mouse model with biallelic liver-specific deletion of Pten and Grp78 mediated by Albumin-Cre-recombinase (cP(f/f)78(f/f)). Interestingly, in contrast to PTEN, deletion of GRP78 was progressive but incomplete. At 3 months, cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers showed hepatomegaly, activation of lipogenic genes, exacerbated steatosis and liver injury, implying that GRP78 protects the liver against PTEN-null-mediated pathogenesis. Furthermore, in response to liver injury, we observed increased proliferation and expansion of bile duct and liver progenitor cells in cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers. Strikingly, bile duct cells in cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers maintained wild-type (WT) GRP78 level, whereas adjacent areas showed GRP78 reduction. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed selective JNK activation, β-catenin downregulation, along with PDGFRα upregulation, which was unique to cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers at 6 months. Development of both HCC and CC was accelerated and was evident in cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers at 8-9 months, coinciding with intense GRP78 expression in the cancer lesions, and GRP78 expression in adjacent normal areas reverted back to the WT level. In contrast, c78(f/f) livers showed no malignancy even at 14 months. These studies reveal that GRP78 is a novel regulator for PTEN-loss-mediated liver injury and cancer progression.","grp78 as a regulator of liver steatosis and cancer progression mediated by loss of the tumor suppressor pten glucose-regulated protein 78 (grp78), a molecular chaperone widely elevated in human cancers, is critical for endoplasmic reticulum (er) protein folding, stress signaling and pi3k/akt activation. genetic knockout models of grp78 revealed that grp78 maintains homeostasis of metabolic organs, including liver, pancreas and adipose tissues. hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and cholangiocarcinoma (cc) are the most common liver cancers. there is a lack of effective therapeutics for hcc and cc, highlighting the need to further understand liver tumorigenic mechanisms. pten (phosphatase and tenson homolog deleted on chromosome 10), a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the pi3k/akt pathway, is inactivated in a wide range of tumors, including 40-50% of human liver cancers. to elucidate the role of grp78 in liver cancer, we created a mouse model with biallelic liver-specific deletion of pten and grp78 mediated by albumin-cre-recombinase",grp regulator liver steatosis progression mediate loss suppressor pten glucose regulate protein grp molecular chaperone widely elevate human critical endoplasmic reticulum er protein fold stress signaling pi k akt activation genetic knockout model grp reveal grp maintain homeostasis metabolic organ include liver pancreas adipose tissue hepatocellular carcinoma hcc cholangiocarcinoma cc common liver lack effective therapeutic hcc cc highlight need understand liver tumorigenic mechanism pten phosphatase tenson homolog delete chromosome suppressor antagonize pi k akt pathway inactivate wide range include human liver elucidate role grp liver create mouse model biallelic liver specific deletion pten grp mediate albumin cre recombinase,b,Liver Cancer
"Lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, and lipoprotein traits and risk of liver cancer: a Mendelian randomization analysis. The current state of knowledge on the relationship between lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, lipoprotein traits with liver cancer risk is still uncertain despite some attempts made by observational studies. This study aims to investigate the causal genetic relationship between factors highly associated with liver cancer incidence by using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Employing MR analysis, this study utilized previously published GWAS datasets to investigate whether lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, and lipoprotein traits would affect the risk of liver cancer. The study utilized three MR methods, including inverse variance-weighted model (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median. Furthermore, MR-Egger analyses were performed to detect heterogeneity in the MR results. The study also conducted a leave-one-out analysis to assess the potential influence of individual SNPs on the MR analysis results. MR-PRESSO was used to identify and remove SNP outliers associated with liver cancer. MR analyses revealed that 2-h glucose (odds ratio, OR 2.33, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.28-4.21), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.37), body mass index (BMI, OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.37), waist circumference (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.37) were associated with increased risk of liver cancer. On the contrary, apolipoproteins B (APOB, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.97), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.92) were negatively related to liver cancer risk. Additionally, after adjusting for BMI, apolipoproteins A-I (APOA-I, OR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.38-0.81), total cholesterol (TC, OR 0.72, 95% CI, 0.54-0.94), and total triglycerides (TG, OR 0.57, 95% CI, 0.40-0.78) exhibited a significant inverse correlation with the risk of liver cancer. This study supports a causal relationship between 2-h glucose, T2DM, BMI, and waist circumference with the increased risk of liver cancer. Conversely, the study reveals a cause-effect relationship between TC, TG, LDL, APOA-I, and APOB with a decreased risk of liver cancer.","lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, and lipoprotein traits and risk of liver cancer: a mendelian randomization analysis. the current state of knowledge on the relationship between lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, lipoprotein traits with liver cancer risk is still uncertain despite some attempts made by observational studies. this study aims to investigate the causal genetic relationship between factors highly associated with liver cancer incidence by using mendelian randomization (mr) analysis. employing mr analysis, this study utilized previously published gwas datasets to investigate whether lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, and lipoprotein traits would affect the risk of liver cancer. the study utilized three mr methods, including inverse variance-weighted model (ivw), mr egger, and weighted median. furthermore, mr-egger analyses were performed to detect heterogeneity in the mr results. the study also conducted a leave-one-out analysis to assess the potential influence of individual snps on the mr analysis results. mr-presso was used to identify and remove",lifestyle factor glycemic trait lipoprotein trait risk liver mendelian randomization current state knowledge relationship lifestyle factor glycemic trait lipoprotein trait liver risk still uncertain despite attempt make observational investigate causal genetic relationship factor highly associate liver incidence use mendelian randomization mr employ mr utilize previously publish gwas datasets investigate whether lifestyle factor glycemic trait lipoprotein trait would affect risk liver utilize three mr method include inverse variance weight model ivw mr egger weighted median furthermore mr egger perform detect heterogeneity mr result also conduct leave one assess potential influence individual snp mr result mr presso use identify remove,b,Liver Cancer
"Uridine prevents tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. Tamoxifen, an agonist of estrogen receptor, is widely prescribed for the prevention and long-term treatment of breast cancer. A side effect of tamoxifen is fatty liver, which increases the risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Prevention of tamoxifen-induced fatty liver has the potential to improve the safety of long-term tamoxifen usage. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside with reported protective effects against drug-induced fatty liver, was co-administered with tamoxifen in C57BL/6J mice. Liver lipid levels were evaluated with lipid visualization using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scatting (CARS) microscopy, biochemical assay measurement of triacylglyceride (TAG), and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurement of membrane phospholipid. Blood TAG and cholesterol levels were measured. Mitochondrial respiration of primary hepatocytes in the presence of tamoxifen and/or uridine was evaluated by measuring oxygen consumption rate with an extracellular flux analyzer. Liver protein lysine acetylation profiles were evaluated with 1D and 2D Western blots. In addition, the relationship between endogenous uridine levels, fatty liver, and tamoxifen administration was evaluated in transgenic mice UPase1; −/−and UPase1-TG. Uridine co-administration prevented tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation in mice. The most prominent effect of uridine co-administration with tamoxifen was the stimulation of liver membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. Uridine had no protective effect against tamoxifen-induced impairment to mitochondrial respiration of primary hepatocytes or liver TAG and cholesterol export. Uridine had no effect on tamoxifen-induced changes to liver protein acetylation profile. Transgenic mice UPase1; −/−with increased pyrimidine salvage activity were protected against tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. In contrast, UPase1-TG mice with increased pyrimidine catabolism activity had intrinsic liver lipid droplet accumulation, which was aggravated following tamoxifen administration. Uridine co-administration was effective at preventing tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. The ability of uridine to prevent tamoxifen-induced fatty liver appeared to depend on the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which promotes biosynthesis of membrane phospholipid.","uridine prevents tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. tamoxifen, an agonist of estrogen receptor, is widely prescribed for the prevention and long-term treatment of breast cancer. a side effect of tamoxifen is fatty liver, which increases the risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. prevention of tamoxifen-induced fatty liver has the potential to improve the safety of long-term tamoxifen usage. uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside with reported protective effects against drug-induced fatty liver, was co-administered with tamoxifen in c57bl/6j mice. liver lipid levels were evaluated with lipid visualization using coherent anti-stokes raman scatting (cars) microscopy, biochemical assay measurement of triacylglyceride (tag), and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (lc-ms) measurement of membrane phospholipid. blood tag and cholesterol levels were measured. mitochondrial respiration of primary hepatocytes in the presence of tamoxifen and/or uridine was evaluated by measuring oxygen consumption rate with an extracellular flux analyzer. liver protein lysine acetylation profiles were evaluated with 1d",uridine prevents tamoxifen induce liver lipid droplet accumulation tamoxifen agonist estrogen receptor widely prescribe prevention long term breast side effect tamoxifen fatty liver increase risk non alcoholic fatty liver prevention tamoxifen induce fatty liver potential improve safety long term tamoxifen usage uridine pyrimidine nucleoside report protective effect drug induce fatty liver co administer tamoxifen c bl j mouse liver lipid level evaluate lipid visualization use coherent anti stokes raman scat car microscopy biochemical assay measurement triacylglyceride tag liquid chromatography couple mass spectrometry lc ms measurement membrane phospholipid blood tag cholesterol level measure mitochondrial respiration primary hepatocytes presence tamoxifen uridine evaluate measure oxygen consumption rate extracellular flux analyzer liver protein lysine acetylation profile evaluate,b,Liver Cancer

"PD-L1 expression in liver metastasis: its clinical significance and discordance with primary tumor in colorectal cancer The outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients with liver metastases are poor, which may be related to a different tumor microenvironment in liver metastases from primary tumors. This study was aimed to analyze PD-L1 expression and the immune microenvironment status in liver metastases and compare the differences of PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and liver metastases of colorectal cancer. 74 cases of pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer with liver metastasis underwent resection from our hospital were included. Tissue microarrays were used for the interpretation of PD-L1 expression, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and CD8 density by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the disparity between primary tumor and liver metastasis in PD-L1 expression, CD4 and CD8 density and analyzed the factors associated with obvious PD-L1 disparity. The expression of PD-L1 was positively related to the density of CD4 and CD8 in liver metastases. The expression of PD-L1 in liver metastases was higher than in primary tumors in certain subgroups, including patients with concurrent liver metastases (n = 63, p = 0.05), patients receiving concurrent resection of primary and metastatic tumors (n = 56, p = 0.04). The two subgroups generally reflected those without inconsistent external influences, such as treatment and temporal factors, between primary tumors and liver metastases. In these subgroups, the intrinsic differences of microenvironment between primary tumors and liver metastases could be identified. Furthermore, tumor differentiation [moderate vs. poor: OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.03–0.99, p = 0.05)] were demonstrated to be associated with obvious discordance of PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and liver metastases.

"Baseline liver steatosis has no impact on liver metastases and overall survival in rectal cancer patients The liver is one of the most frequent sites of metastases in rectal cancer. This study aimed to evaluate how the development of synchronous or metachronous liver metastasis and overall survival are impacted by baseline liver steatosis and chemotherapy-induced liver damage in rectal cancer patients. Patients diagnosed with stage II to IV rectal cancer between 2010 and 2016 in our province with suitable baseline CT scan were included. Data on cancer diagnosis, staging, therapy, outcomes and liver function were collected. CT scans were retrospectively reviewed to assess baseline steatosis (liver density < 48 HU and/or liver-to-spleen ratio < 1.1). Among patients without baseline steatosis and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced liver damage was defined as steatosis appearance, ≥ 10% liver volume increase, or significant increase in liver function tests. We included 283 stage II to IV rectal cancer patients with suitable CT scan (41% females; mean age 68 ± 14 years). Steatosis was present at baseline in 90 (31.8%) patients, synchronous liver metastasis in 42 (15%) patients and metachronous liver metastasis in 26 (11%); 152 (54%) deaths were registered. The prevalence of synchronous liver metastasis was higher in patients with steatosis (19% vs 13%), while the incidence of metachronous liver metastasis was similar. After correcting for age, sex, stage, and year of diagnosis, steatosis was not associated with metachronous liver metastasis nor with overall survival. In a small analysis of 63 patients without baseline steatosis and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced liver damage was associated with higher incidence of metachronous liver metastasis and worse survival, results which need to be confirmed by larger studies. Our data suggest that rectal cancer patients with steatosis had a similar occurrence of metastases during follow-up, even if the burden of liver metastases at diagnosis was slightly higher, compatible with chance.","baseline liver steatosis has no impact on liver metastases and overall survival in rectal cancer patients the liver is one of the most frequent sites of metastases in rectal cancer. this study aimed to evaluate how the development of synchronous or metachronous liver metastasis and overall survival are impacted by baseline liver steatosis and chemotherapy-induced liver damage in rectal cancer patients. patients diagnosed with stage ii to iv rectal cancer between 2010 and 2016 in our province with suitable baseline ct scan were included. data on cancer diagnosis, staging, therapy, outcomes and liver function were collected. ct scans were retrospectively reviewed to assess baseline steatosis (liver density < 48 hu and/or liver-to-spleen ratio < 1.1). among patients without baseline steatosis and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced liver damage was defined as steatosis appearance, ≥ 10% liver volume increase, or significant increase in liver function tests. we included 283 stage ii",baseline liver steatosis impact liver metastasis overall survival rectal liver one frequent site metastasis rectal evaluate development synchronous metachronous liver metastasis overall survival impact baseline liver steatosis chemotherapy induce liver damage rectal diagnose stage ii iv rectal province suitable baseline ct scan include data diagnosis stag therapy outcome liver function collect ct scan retrospectively review assess baseline steatosis liver density hu liver spleen ratio among without baseline steatosis treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy induce liver damage define steatosis appearance liver volume increase significant increase liver function test include stage ii,b,Liver Cancer

"Linc00210 drives Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation and liver tumor progression through CTNNBIP1-dependent manner. Liver tumor initiating cells (TICs) have self-renewal and differentiation properties, accounting for tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance. Long noncoding RNAs are involved in many physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. DNA copy number alterations (CNA) participate in tumor formation and progression, while the CNA of lncRNAs and their roles are largely unknown. LncRNA CNA was determined by microarray analyses, realtime PCR and DNA FISH. Liver TICs were enriched by surface marker CD133 and oncosphere formation. TIC self-renewal was analyzed by oncosphere formation, tumor initiation and propagation. CRISPRi and ASO were used for lncRNA loss of function. RNA pulldown, western blot and double FISH were used to identify the interaction between lncRNA and CTNNBIP1. Using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a frequently amplified long noncoding RNA in liver cancer termed linc00210, which was highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. Linc00210 copy number gain is associated with its high expression in liver cancer and liver TICs. Linc00210 promoted self-renewal and tumor initiating capacity of liver TICs through Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Linc00210 interacted with CTNNBIP1 and blocked its inhibitory role in Wnt/β-catenin activation. Linc00210 silencing cells showed enhanced interaction of β-catenin and CTNNBIP1, and impaired interaction of β-catenin and TCF/LEF components. We also confirmed linc00210 copy number gain using primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, and found the correlation between linc00210 CNA and Wnt/β-catenin activation. Of interest, linc00210, CTNNBIP1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling targeting can efficiently inhibit tumor growth and progression, and liver TIC propagation.

"The novel mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 (temsirolimus) induces antiproliferative effects through inhibition of mTOR in Bel-7402 liver cancer cells. Background: Liver cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in the world. Targeted therapy of cancer with specific inhibitors is developing and has shown promising antitumor efficacy. CCI-779 (temsirolimus), a specific inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), can block the mTOR signaling pathway. Here, we systematically examined the expression of mTOR and its downstream targets in liver cancer cells and normal liver cells, then investigated inhibitory effects of CCI-779 on mTOR signaling pathway and its role in regulating liver cancer cell growth. Methods: The expression of mTOR and its downstream targets in Bel-7402 liver cancer cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells were examined by western blot. The mTOR specific inhibitor (CCI-779) was used to treat Bel-7402 cells to identify its effects on Bel-7402 cell growth and activity of mTOR signaling pathway in vitro. Cell viability tests were performed after the treatment of CCI-779. Western blot was applied to assess the changes of mTOR pathway and flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle of Bel-7402 cells after the treatment of CCI-779. Results: mTOR, p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1 were overexpressed in Bel-7402 cells compared with HL-7702 cells. Bel-7402 cells were sensitive to CCI-779. The survival rate of the cells treated with CCI-779 over 0.312 μM was significantly different compared with that of control (P< 0.05). CCI-779 inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K (Thr389), S6 (Ser240/244), and 4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in different grades and the expressions of p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1. As a result, CCI-779 induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, G1/S arrest and damage of cell shape. Conclusions: Taken together, these data showed that CCI-779 can inhibit mTOR signaling and proliferation in Bel7402 liver cancer cells in vitro.

"An Analysis of Content in Comprehensive Cancer Control Plans that Address Chronic Hepatitis B and C Virus Infections as Major Risk Factors for Liver Cancer Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HBV and HCV) infections are among the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Chronic viral hepatitis is the cause of most primary liver cancer, which is the third leading cause of cancer deaths globally and the ninth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The extent to which comprehensive cancer control (CCC) programs in states, tribal governments and organizations, territories, and Pacific Island jurisdictions address chronic hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infections as risk factors for liver cancer or recommend interventions for liver cancer prevention in their CCC plans remains unknown. We searched CCC plans for this information using the search tool at http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/ncccp/ to access the content of plans for this information. A combination of key search terms including “liver cancer”, “hepatitis”, “chronic alcohol”, and “alcohol abuse” were used to identify potential content regarding liver cancer risk factors and prevention.

"Irigenin exerts anticancer effects on human liver cancer cells via induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and cell cycle arrest Irigenin has been reported to exhibit remarkable anticancer effects against several human cancers. Nonetheless, the anticancer effects of irigenin against the human liver cancer cells are still largely unexplored. Consistently, this study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of irigenin against human liver cancer cells and to unveil the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results showed that irigenin significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the growth of the human HepG2 and SNU-182 liver cancer cells with an IC50 value of 14 µM. Nonetheless, the cytotoxic effects of irigenin against the normal THLE-2 cells were comparatively lower as evident from the IC50 of 120 μM. The AO/EB and DAPI staining showed that irigenin induces apoptosis in the human liver cancer cells. Annexin V/PI staining assay revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of apoptotic HepG2 and SNU-182 liver cancer cells upon treatment with irigenin. It was found that the number of apoptotic HepG2 and SNU-182 cells enhanced from 2.3 to 41.75% and 1.16 to 51.9% at IC50, respectively. Western blot showed a considerable increase in Bax and decrease in the Bcl-2 expression upon irigenin treatment further confirming the induction of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that irigenin also induces G2/M cell cycle arrest of HepG2 and SNU-182 cells. The percentage of G2/M phase HepG2 and SNU-182 cells increased from 17.92 to 34.35% and 23.97 to 38.23% at IC50, respectively This was also accompanied by decrease in the expression of CDK1 and Cyclin-B in HepG2 and SNU-182 cells. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that irigenin inhibits the growth of the human liver cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These results point towards the potential of irigenin as a lead for the development of chemotherapy for liver cancer.","irigenin exerts anticancer effects on human liver cancer cells via induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and cell cycle arrest irigenin has been reported to exhibit remarkable anticancer effects against several human cancers. nonetheless, the anticancer effects of irigenin against the human liver cancer cells are still largely unexplored. consistently, this study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of irigenin against human liver cancer cells and to unveil the underlying molecular mechanisms. the results showed that irigenin significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the growth of the human hepg2 and snu-182 liver cancer cells with an ic50 value of 14 µm. nonetheless, the cytotoxic effects of irigenin against the normal thle-2 cells were comparatively lower as evident from the ic50 of 120 μm. the ao/eb and dapi staining showed that irigenin induces apoptosis in the human liver cancer cells. annexin v/pi staining assay revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the",irigenin exerts anticancer effect human liver cell via induction mitochondrial apoptosis cell cycle arrest irigenin report exhibit remarkable anticancer effect several human nonetheless anticancer effect irigenin human liver cell still largely unexplored consistently design evaluate anticancer effect irigenin human liver cell unveil underlying molecular mechanism result show irigenin significantly p inhibit growth human hepg snu liver cell ic value nonetheless cytotoxic effect irigenin normal thle cell comparatively low evident ic ao eb dapi staining show irigenin induces apoptosis human liver cell annexin v pi stain assay reveal significant p increase,b,Liver Cancer
"Evaluation of YO-PRO-1 as an early marker of apoptosis following radiofrequency ablation of colon cancer liver metastases Radiofrequency (RF) ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive treatment for colorectal-cancer liver metastases (CLM) in selected nonsurgical patients. Unlike surgical resection, RFA is not followed by routine pathological examination of the target tumor and the surrounding liver tissue. The aim of this study was the evaluation of apoptotic events after RFA. Specifically, we evaluated YO-PRO-1 (YP1), a green fluorescent DNA marker for cells with compromised plasma membrane, as a potential, early marker of cell death. YP1 was applied on liver tissue adherent on the RF electrode used for CLM ablation, as well as on biopsy samples from the center and the margin of the ablation zone as depicted by dynamic CT immediately after RFA. Normal pig and mouse liver tissues were used for comparison. The same samples were also immunostained for fragmented DNA (TUNEL assay) and for active mitochondria (anti-OxPhos antibody). YP1 was also used simultaneously with propidium iodine (PI) to stain mouse liver and samples from ablated CLM. Following RFA of human CLM, more than 90 % of cells were positive for YP1. In nonablated, dissected pig and mouse liver however, we found similar YP1 signals (93.1 % and 65 %, respectively). In samples of intact mouse liver parenchyma, there was a significantly smaller proportion of YP1 positive cells (22.7 %). YP1 and PI staining was similar for ablated CLM. However in dissected normal mouse liver there was initial YP1 positivity and complete absence of the PI signal and only later there was PI signal. Conclusion: This is the first time that YP1 was applied in liver parenchymal tissue (rather than cell culture). The results suggest that YP1 is a very sensitive marker of early cellular events reflecting an early and widespread plasma membrane injury that allows YP1 penetration into the cells.","evaluation of yo-pro-1 as an early marker of apoptosis following radiofrequency ablation of colon cancer liver metastases radiofrequency (rf) ablation (rfa) is a minimally invasive treatment for colorectal-cancer liver metastases (clm) in selected nonsurgical patients. unlike surgical resection, rfa is not followed by routine pathological examination of the target tumor and the surrounding liver tissue. the aim of this study was the evaluation of apoptotic events after rfa. specifically, we evaluated yo-pro-1 (yp1), a green fluorescent dna marker for cells with compromised plasma membrane, as a potential, early marker of cell death. yp1 was applied on liver tissue adherent on the rf electrode used for clm ablation, as well as on biopsy samples from the center and the margin of the ablation zone as depicted by dynamic ct immediately after rfa. normal pig and mouse liver tissues were used for comparison. the same samples were also immunostained for fragmented dna",evaluation yo pro early marker apoptosis follow radiofrequency ablation colon liver metastases radiofrequency rf ablation rfa minimally invasive colorectal liver metastases clm selected nonsurgical unlike surgical resection rfa follow routine pathological examination target surround liver tissue evaluation apoptotic event rfa specifically evaluate yo pro yp green fluorescent dna marker cell compromised plasma membrane potential early marker cell death yp apply liver tissue adherent rf electrode use clm ablation well biopsy sample center margin ablation zone depict dynamic ct immediately rfa normal pig mouse liver tissue use comparison sample also immunostained fragmented dna,b,Liver Cancer
"IDEAL-IQ in an oncologic population: meeting the challenge of concomitant liver fat and liver iron. Cancer patients often have a history of chemotherapy, putting them at increased risk of liver toxicity and pancytopenia, leading to elevated liver fat and elevated liver iron respectively. T1-in-and-out-of-phase, the conventional MR technique for liver fat assessment, fails to detect elevated liver fat in the presence of concomitantly elevated liver iron. IDEAL-IQ is a more recently introduced MR fat quantification method that corrects for multiple confounding factors, including elevated liver iron. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with a waiver for informed consent. We reviewed the MRI studies of 50 cancer patients (30 males, 20 females, 50–78 years old) whose exams included (1) T1-in-and-out-of-phase, (2) IDEAL-IQ, and (3) T2* mapping. Two readers independently assessed fat and iron content from conventional and IDEAL-IQ MR methods. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated to evaluate agreement between conventional MRI and IDEAL-IQ in measuring R2* level (a surrogate for iron level), and in measuring fat level. Agreement between the two readers was also assessed. Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed to compare iron level and fat fraction between conventional MRI and IDEAL-IQ. Twenty percent of patients had both elevated liver iron and moderate/severe hepatic steatosis. Across all patients, there was high agreement between readers for IDEAL-IQ fat fraction (ICC = 0.957) and IDEAL R2* (ICC = 0.971) measurements, but lower agreement for conventional fat fraction measurements (ICC = 0.626). The fat fractions calculated with IOP were statistically significantly different from those calculated with IDEAL-IQ (reader 1: p < 0.001, reader 2: p < 0.001). Fat measurements using IDEAL-IQ and IOP diverged in patients with concomitantly elevated liver fat and liver iron. Given prior work validating IDEAL-IQ, these diverging measurements indicate that IOP is inadequate to screen for hepatic steatosis in our cancer population.","ideal-iq in an oncologic population: meeting the challenge of concomitant liver fat and liver iron. cancer patients often have a history of chemotherapy, putting them at increased risk of liver toxicity and pancytopenia, leading to elevated liver fat and elevated liver iron respectively. t1-in-and-out-of-phase, the conventional mr technique for liver fat assessment, fails to detect elevated liver fat in the presence of concomitantly elevated liver iron. ideal-iq is a more recently introduced mr fat quantification method that corrects for multiple confounding factors, including elevated liver iron. this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with a waiver for informed consent. we reviewed the mri studies of 50 cancer patients (30 males, 20 females, 50–78 years old) whose exams included (1) t1-in-and-out-of-phase, (2) ideal-iq, and (3) t2* mapping. two readers independently assessed fat and iron content from conventional and ideal-iq mr methods. intraclass correlation coefficient (icc) was estimated to",ideal iq oncologic population meet challenge concomitant liver fat liver iron often history chemotherapy put increase risk liver toxicity pancytopenia lead elevate liver fat elevate liver iron respectively phase conventional mr technique liver fat assessment fail detect elevate liver fat presence concomitantly elevate liver iron ideal iq recently introduce mr fat quantification method correct multiple confound factor include elevate liver iron retrospective approve institutional review board waiver informed consent review mri males female year old whose exam include phase ideal iq mapping two reader independently assess fat iron content conventional ideal iq mr method intraclass correlation coefficient icc estimate,b,Liver Cancer
"Adjuvant Transarterial chemoembolization does not influence recurrence-free or overall survival in patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma after curative resection: a propensity score matching analysis The prognosis of patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) is usually poor, and effective adjuvant therapy is missing making it important to investigate whether these patients may benefit from adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). We aimed to evaluate the efficiency of adjuvant TACE for long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection before and after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. In this retrospective study, of 230 patients who underwent resection for CHC between January 1994 and December 2014, 46 (18.0%) patients received adjuvant TACE. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify the independent predictive factors of survival. Cox regression analyses and log-rank tests were used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between patients who did or did not receive adjuvant TACE. A total of 230 patients (mean age 52.2 ± 11.9 years; 172 men) were enrolled, and 46 (mean age 52.7 ± 11.1 years; 38 men) patients received TACE. Before PSM, in multivariate regression analysis, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), tumour nodularity, macrovascular invasion (MVI), lymphoid metastasis, and extrahepatic metastasis were associated with OS. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), MVI, lymphoid metastasis, and preventive TACE (HR: 2.763, 95% CI: 1.769–4.314, p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for DFS. PSM created 46 pairs of patients. Before PSM, adjuvant preventive TACE was not associated with an increased risk of OS (HR: 0.911, 95% CI: 0.545–1.520, p = 0.720) or DFS (HR: 3.345, 95% CI: 1.686–6.638, p = 0.001).

"Liver cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia (2001-2020): decreasing trend. Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality and morbidity worldwide. Existing data on the liver cancer burden in Saudi Arabia are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze liver cancer incidence and mortality trends in Saudi Arabia over two decades (2001-2020) and to compare them with the regional and worldwide data. Liver cancer incidence data in Saudi Arabia were collected from the national cancer registry reports for the study period (2001 to 2020). Additionally, global and regional data on liver cancer burden were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO); the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC); and the Global Cancer Observatory website. Saudi Arabia revealed a relatively lower burden of liver cancer compared to global rates. Males showed a decreasing trend in age-standardized incidence rates during the study period, while females displayed steady rates. In 2020, liver cancer incidence in males was nearly doubled compared to females with a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. Additionally, significant regional variations in the incidence of liver cancer were observed across the administrative regions in Saudi Arabia. Liver cancer ranked first as a cause of cancer death in Saudi Arabia for the year 2020. This trend extends to the broader Gulf Cooperation Council region that includes Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates; with Saudi Arabia experiencing the highest liver cancer mortality rate (5.1 per 100,000 people). In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of gender- and region-specific analysis of liver cancer in Saudi Arabia. While the decline of liver cancer incidence in males is promising, further investigations are needed to understand the underlying causes and maintain observance. The high national mortality rate from liver cancer underscores the need for improved prevention, early detection, and management strategies.","liver cancer incidence in saudi arabia (2001-2020): decreasing trend. liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality and morbidity worldwide. existing data on the liver cancer burden in saudi arabia are limited. therefore, this study aimed to analyze liver cancer incidence and mortality trends in saudi arabia over two decades (2001-2020) and to compare them with the regional and worldwide data. liver cancer incidence data in saudi arabia were collected from the national cancer registry reports for the study period (2001 to 2020). additionally, global and regional data on liver cancer burden were obtained from the world health organization (who); the international agency for research on cancer (iarc); and the global cancer observatory website. saudi arabia revealed a relatively lower burden of liver cancer compared to global rates. males showed a decreasing trend in age-standardized incidence rates during the study period, while females displayed steady rates. in 2020, liver",liver incidence saudi arabia decrease trend liver lead cause mortality morbidity worldwide exist data liver burden saudi arabia limit therefore analyze liver incidence mortality trend saudi arabia two decade compare regional worldwide data liver incidence data saudi arabia collect national registry report period additionally global regional data liver burden obtain world health organization international agency research iarc global observatory website saudi arabia reveal relatively low burden liver compare global rate male show decrease trend age standardized incidence rate period female display steady rate liver,b,Liver Cancer
"An invasive zone in human liver cancer identified by Stereo-seq promotes hepatocyte-tumor cell crosstalk, local immunosuppression and tumor progression. Dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and developing effective new treatments. Using a novel tumor border scanning and digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as ""the invasive zone"". We detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. We also identified a subpopulation of damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAAs) located close to the border on the paratumor side. Overexpression of CXCL6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway in nearby hepatocytes, which subsequently caused SAAs' overexpression in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression and secretion of SAAs by hepatocytes in the invasive zone could lead to the recruitment of macrophages and M2 polarization, further promoting local immunosuppression, potentially resulting in tumor progression. Clinical association analysis in additional five independent cohorts of patients with primary and secondary liver cancer (n = 423) showed that patients with overexpression of SAAs in the invasive zone had a worse prognosis. Further in vivo experiments using mouse liver tumor models in situ confirmed that the knockdown of genes encoding SAAs in hepatocytes decreased macrophage accumulation around the tumor border and delayed tumor growth. The identification and characterization of a novel invasive zone in human cancer patients not only add an important layer of understanding regarding the mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis, but may also pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for advanced liver cancer and other solid tumors.","an invasive zone in human liver cancer identified by stereo-seq promotes hepatocyte-tumor cell crosstalk, local immunosuppression and tumor progression. dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and developing effective new treatments. using a novel tumor border scanning and digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as ""the invasive zone"". we detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. we also identified a subpopulation of damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid a1 and a2 (referred to collectively as saas) located close to the border on the paratumor side. overexpression of cxcl6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce activation of the",invasive zone human liver identify stereo seq promote hepatocyte cell crosstalk local immunosuppression progression dissecting understand ecosystem especially around margin strong implication cell infiltration invasion essential explore mechanism metastasis develop effective new use novel border scanning digitization model enable nanoscale resolution spatial enhance resolution omics sequence stereo seq identify wide zone center around border liver refer invasive zone detect strong immunosuppression metabolic reprogramming severely damage hepatocytes zone also identify subpopulation damage hepatocytes increased expression serum amyloid refer collectively saas locate close border paratumor side overexpression cxcl adjacent malignant cell could induce activation,b,Liver Cancer

"Application of Serum Annexin A3 in Diagnosis, Outcome Prediction and Therapeutic Response Evaluation for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Annexin A3 (ANXA3) could induce progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via promoting stem cell traits of CD133-positive cells. Moreover, serum ANXA3 showed preliminary diagnostic potential, however further validation was required. Meanwhile, the prognostic value of ANXA3 remained elusive. The present study aimed to validate diagnostic performance and further systematically investigate the prognostic value of serum ANXA3. Serum ANXA3 of 368 HCC patients was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); 295 of these patients underwent resection and 73 underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Diagnostic performance of ANXA3 was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the prognostic value was evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis. To evaluate the relationship between serum ANXA3 and circulating CD133 mRNA-positive tumor cells (CD133mRNA+ CTCs), real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted in 69 patients who underwent resection. Serum ANXA3 provided greater diagnostic performance than α-fetoprotein (area under the curve [AUC] 0.869 vs. 0.782), especially in early diagnosis (AUC 0.852 vs. 0.757) and discriminating HCC from patients at risk (0.832 vs. 0.736). Pretreatment ANXA3 was an independent predictor of tumor recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26–2.76, p = 0.002)/progression (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.04–3.43, p = 0.038) and survival (resectable: HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.44–3.56, p = 0.001; unresectable: HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.10–4.05, p = 0.025), and retained its performance in low-recurrence-risk subgroups. Specifically, dynamic changes of ANXA3-positive status was associated with worse prognosis. ANXA3 was positively correlated with CD133mRNA+ CTCs (r = 0.601, p < 0.001). In patients with detectable CD133mRNA+ CTC, high ANXA3 was positively associated with a higher risk of recurrence and shorter overall survival.

"Microvascular invasion has limited clinical values in hepatocellular carcinoma patients at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0 or B Microvascular invasion (MVI) is recognized as a prognostic factor associated with poor outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative resection. It remains unclear, however, whether MVI can provide prognostic information for patients at a specific tumor stage. Consecutive HCC patients who underwent curative resection in years of 2007 and 2008 (discovery cohort) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were stratified by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The prognostic significance of MVI for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was studied in each subgroup. The clinical significance of MVI was validated in another cohort of patients underwent curative surgery in the year of 2006 (validation cohort). Of the 1540 patients in the discovery cohort, 389 (25.3%) patients had detectable MVI. Occurrence rates of MVI in the BCLC stage 0, A, and B subgroups were 12.4, 26.2, and 34.4%, respectively. In univariate analysis, MVI was associated with poor OS and RFS (P < 0.001 for both) in HCC patients at stage A, with poor OS in patients at stage 0 (P = 0.028), and with poor RFS at stage B (P = 0.039).

"The histological growth pattern of colorectal cancer liver metastases has prognostic value Little is known about the biological characteristics that determine the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases. In previous work we reported three different histological patterns of the tumour-liver interface of CRC liver metastases, termed the pushing, replacement and desmoplastic growth pattern (GP). The purpose of this study was to confirm differences in angiogenic and hypoxic properties of CRC liver metastases with different GPs in a large data set and to study the value of the GP as a prognostic factor. In 205 patients undergoing a resection of CRC liver metastases, the GP of the metastasis was determined using haematoxylin-eosin and Gordon Sweet’s silver staining. The tumour cell proliferation fraction (TCP%), endothelial cell proliferation fraction (ECP%) and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) expression were determined using immunohistochemistry. Standard clinicopathological data and overall survival were recorded. 27.8, 15.6, 34.6 and 17.6 % of liver metastases had a replacement, pushing, desmoplastic and mixed GP, respectively. Analyses of TCP%, ECP% and CA9 expression demonstrated that CRC liver metastases with a replacement GP are non-angiogenic, while the ones with a pushing GP are the most angiogenic with angiogenesis being, at least partially, hypoxia-driven. GP (pushing or not) was the only independent predictor of survival at 2 years. CRC liver metastases grow according to different GP patterns with different angiogenic properties. At 2 years of follow-up a GP with a pushing component was an independent predictor of poor survival, suggesting that the pushing GP is characterized by a more aggressive tumour biology. Further elucidation of the mechanisms and biological pathways involved in and responsible for the differences in GP between CRC liver metastases in different patients might lead to therapeutic agents and strategies taking advantage of this 2 year ‘window of opportunity’.","the histological growth pattern of colorectal cancer liver metastases has prognostic value little is known about the biological characteristics that determine the prognosis of colorectal cancer (crc) liver metastases. in previous work we reported three different histological patterns of the tumour-liver interface of crc liver metastases, termed the pushing, replacement and desmoplastic growth pattern (gp). the purpose of this study was to confirm differences in angiogenic and hypoxic properties of crc liver metastases with different gps in a large data set and to study the value of the gp as a prognostic factor. in 205 patients undergoing a resection of crc liver metastases, the gp of the metastasis was determined using haematoxylin-eosin and gordon sweet’s silver staining. the tumour cell proliferation fraction (tcp%), endothelial cell proliferation fraction (ecp%) and carbonic anhydrase 9 (ca9) expression were determined using immunohistochemistry. standard clinicopathological data and overall survival were recorded. 27.8, 15.6, 34.6 and",histological growth pattern colorectal liver metastases prognostic value little know biological characteristic determine prognosis colorectal crc liver metastasis previous work report three different histological pattern liver interface crc liver metastasis term push replacement desmoplastic growth pattern gp confirm difference angiogenic hypoxic property crc liver metastases different gps large data set value gp prognostic factor undergo resection crc liver metastases gp metastasis determine use haematoxylin eosin gordon sweet silver stain cell proliferation fraction tcp endothelial cell proliferation fraction ecp carbonic anhydrase ca expression determine use immunohistochemistry standard clinicopathological data overall survival record,b,Liver Cancer

"TGF-β signaling alters the pattern of liver tumorigenesis induced by Pten inactivation. Hepatocarcinogenesis results from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in liver cells. A common mechanism through which these alterations induce liver cancer is by deregulating signaling pathways. A number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways have been implicated in normal liver development as well as in cancer formation. In this study, we assessed the effect of the TGF-β signaling pathway on liver tumors induced by phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) loss. Inactivation of only the TGF-β receptor type II, Tgfbr2, in the mouse liver (Tgfbr2(LKO)) had no overt phenotype, while inactivation of Pten alone (Pten(LKO)), resulted in the formation of both hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas (CC). Interestingly, deletion of both Pten and Tgfbr2 (Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) in the mouse liver resulted in a dramatic shift in tumor type to predominantly CC. Assessment of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway revealed increased phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) in both the Pten(LKO) and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice, suggesting that this pathway is constitutively active regardless of the status of the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was observed in the liver of all three phenotypes (Tgfbr2(LKO), Pten(LKO), Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) indicating that the loss of Tgfbr2 and/or Pten leads to an increase in this signaling pathway. Analysis of markers of liver progenitor/stem cells revealed that the loss of TGF-β signaling resulted in increased expression of c-Kit and CD133. Furthermore, in addition to increased c-Kit and CD133, Scf and EpCam expression were also increased in the double knock-out mice. These results suggest that the alteration in tumor types between the Pten(LKO) mice and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice is secondary to the altered regulation of stem-cell features induced by the loss of TGF-β signaling.","tgf-β signaling alters the pattern of liver tumorigenesis induced by pten inactivation. hepatocarcinogenesis results from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in liver cells. a common mechanism through which these alterations induce liver cancer is by deregulating signaling pathways. a number of signaling pathways, including the pi3k/pten/akt and transforming growth factor β (tgf-β) pathways have been implicated in normal liver development as well as in cancer formation. in this study, we assessed the effect of the tgf-β signaling pathway on liver tumors induced by phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) loss. inactivation of only the tgf-β receptor type ii, tgfbr2, in the mouse liver (tgfbr2(lko)) had no overt phenotype, while inactivation of pten alone (pten(lko)), resulted in the formation of both hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas (cc). interestingly, deletion of both pten and tgfbr2 (pten(lko);tgfbr2(lko)) in the mouse liver resulted in a dramatic shift in tumor type to predominantly cc. assessment",tgf signal alters pattern liver tumorigenesis induce pten inactivation hepatocarcinogenesis result accumulation genetic epigenetic change liver cell common mechanism alteration induce liver deregulate signal pathway number signal pathway include pi k pten akt transform growth factor tgf pathway implicate normal liver development well formation assess effect tgf signal pathway liver induce phosphatase tensin homolog pten loss inactivation tgf receptor type ii tgfbr mouse liver tgfbr lko overt phenotype inactivation pten alone pten lko result formation hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinomas cc interestingly deletion pten tgfbr pten lko tgfbr lko mouse liver result dramatic shift type predominantly cc assessment,b,Liver Cancer

"Down-regulation of sirtuin 3 is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma after resection Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), one of the seven Sirtuins family members, plays critical roles in the progression of multiple cancer types. However, its role in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been investigated systematically. The correlation of Sirtuins expression with prognosis of HCC was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a large HCC patient cohort (n = 342). Expression of Sirt3 in tumoral and peritumoral tissues of HCC patients were further determined by western blotting (WB). IHC and WB studies both showed a decreased expression of Sirt3 in tumoral tissues compared with peritumoral tissues (P = 0.003 for IHC, P = 0.0042 for WB). Decreased expression of Sirt3 in both tumoral and peritumoral tissues was associated with increased recurrence probability and decreased overall survival rate by univariate analyses (intratumoral Sirt3: P = 0.011 for TTR, P = 0.001 for OS; peritumoral Sirt3: P = 0.017 for TTR, P = 0.023 for OS), the prognostic value was strengthened by multivariate analyses (intratumoral Sirt3: P = 0.031 for TTR, P = 0.001 for OS; peritumoral Sirt3: P = 0.047 for TTR, P = 0.031 for OS).

Colorectal cancer accounts for 11% of all cancers in the United States and the majority of deaths are associated with liver metastasis. If left untreated, median survival is only six to 12 months. Resection of liver metastases offers the only chance for cure. Of the small number of patients who have operable cancer most will have further tumor recurrence. The molecular mechanisms associated with colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver are largely unknown. However CEA production has been shown both clinically and experimentally to be a factor in an increased metastatic potential of colorectal cancers to the liver. CEA also has a role in protecting tumor cells from the effects of anoikis and this affords a selective advantage for tumor cell survival in the circulation. CEA acts in the liver through its interaction with its receptor (CEAR), a protein that is related to the hnRNP M family of RNA binding proteins. In the liver CEA binds with hnRNP M on Kupffer cells and causes activation and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α. These cytokines affect the up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium and protect the tumor cells against cytotoxicity by nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive oxygen radicals. HnRNP M signaling in Kupffer cells appears to be controlled by beta-adrenergic receptor activation. The cells will respond to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline resulting in reduced TNF-α and increased IL-10 and IL-6 production following CEA activation. This has implications for the control of tumor cell implantation and survival in the liver.","carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and its receptor hnrnp m are mediators of metastasis and the inflammatory response in the liver. this article discusses the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) as a facilitator of the inflammatory response and its effect on colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis. colorectal cancer accounts for 11% of all cancers in the united states and the majority of deaths are associated with liver metastasis. if left untreated, median survival is only six to 12 months. resection of liver metastases offers the only chance for cure. of the small number of patients who have operable cancer most will have further tumor recurrence. the molecular mechanisms associated with colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver are largely unknown. however cea production has been shown both clinically and experimentally to be a factor in an increased metastatic potential of colorectal cancers to the liver. cea also has a role in protecting tumor cells",carcinoembryonic antigen cea receptor hnrnp mediator metastasis inflammatory response liver article discuss role carcinoembryonic antigen cea facilitator inflammatory response effect colorectal hepatic metastasis colorectal account united state majority death associate liver metastasis leave untreated median survival six month resection liver metastasis offer chance cure small number operable recurrence molecular mechanism associate colorectal metastasis liver largely unknown however cea production show clinically experimentally factor increase metastatic potential colorectal liver cea also role protect cell,b,Liver Cancer

"Arsenic trioxide augments immunogenic cell death and induces cGAS-STING-IFN pathway activation in hepatocellular carcinoma. The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is particularly challenging due to the inherent tumoral heterogeneity and easy resistance towards chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has emerged as a cytotoxic agent effective for treating solid tumors, including advanced HCC. However, its effectiveness in HCC treatment remains limited, and the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the effects and mechanisms of ATO in HCC. By evaluating the susceptibilities of human and murine HCC cell lines to ATO treatment, we discovered that HCC cells exhibited a range of sensitivity to ATO treatment, highlighting their inherent heterogeneity. A gene signature comprising 265 genes was identified to distinguish ATO-sensitive from ATO-insensitive cells. According to this signature, HCC patients have also been classified and exhibited differential features of ATO response. Our results showed that ATO treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the activation of multiple cell death modalities, including necroptosis and ferroptosis, in ATO-sensitive HCC cells. Meanwhile, elevated tumoral immunogenicity was also observed in ATO-sensitive HCC cells. Similar effects were not observed in ATO-insensitive cells. We reported that ATO treatment induced mitochondrial injury and mtDNA release into the cytoplasm in ATO-sensitive HCC tumors. This subsequently activated the cGAS-STING-IFN axis, facilitating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and activation. However, we found that the IFN pathway also induced tumoral PD-L1 expression, potentially antagonizing ATO-mediated immune attack. Additional anti-PD1 therapy promoted the anti-tumor response of ATO in ATO-sensitive HCC tumors. In summary, our data indicate that heterogeneous ATO responses exist in HCC tumors, and ATO treatment significantly induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activates the tumor-derived mtDNA-STING-IFN axis. These findings may offer a new perspective on the clinical treatment of HCC and warrant further study.","arsenic trioxide augments immunogenic cell death and induces cgas-sting-ifn pathway activation in hepatocellular carcinoma. the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is particularly challenging due to the inherent tumoral heterogeneity and easy resistance towards chemotherapy and immunotherapy. arsenic trioxide (ato) has emerged as a cytotoxic agent effective for treating solid tumors, including advanced hcc. however, its effectiveness in hcc treatment remains limited, and the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. therefore, this study aimed to characterize the effects and mechanisms of ato in hcc. by evaluating the susceptibilities of human and murine hcc cell lines to ato treatment, we discovered that hcc cells exhibited a range of sensitivity to ato treatment, highlighting their inherent heterogeneity. a gene signature comprising 265 genes was identified to distinguish ato-sensitive from ato-insensitive cells. according to this signature, hcc patients have also been classified and exhibited differential features of ato response. our results showed that ato treatment",arsenic trioxide augments immunogenic cell death induces cgas sting ifn pathway activation hepatocellular carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma hcc particularly challenging due inherent tumoral heterogeneity easy resistance towards chemotherapy immunotherapy arsenic trioxide ato emerge cytotoxic agent effective treat solid include advanced hcc however effectiveness hcc remain limited underlying mechanism still uncertain therefore characterize effect mechanism ato hcc evaluate susceptibility human murine hcc cell line ato discover hcc cell exhibit range sensitivity ato highlight inherent heterogeneity gene signature comprise gene identify distinguish ato sensitive ato insensitive cell accord signature hcc also classify exhibit differential feature ato response result show ato,b,Liver Cancer

"Alcohol consumption and liver cancer risk: a meta-analysis Alcohol is a confirmed risk factor of liver cancer. Yet, its dose–response function and synergistic effects with other risk factors remain unclear. We performed a meta-analysis on publications up to May 2014. A total of 112 publications were identified. The meta-relative risk (mRR) and the dose–response trend were calculated. Tests for heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were performed. The synergy index (SI) was recorded or calculated, whenever possible. Compared to individuals who never drank or drank at very low frequencies, the mRR for ever drinkers was 1.29 (95 % confidence interval, CI 1.16–1.42) and 1.46 (95 % CI 1.27–1.65) for case–control studies, and 1.07 (95 % CI 0.87–1.27) for cohort studies. Being a current drinker was associated with an increased liver cancer risk in case–control studies (mRR = 1.55, 95 % CI 0.38–2.73), but not in cohort studies (mRR = 0.86, 95 % CI 0.74–0.97). The dose–response relation between alcohol and liver cancer was apparent with RR = 1.08 (95 % CI 1.04–1.11) for 12 g/day (~1 drink), 1.54 (95 % CI 1.36–1.74) for 50 g/day, 2.14 (95 % CI 1.74–2.62) for 75 g/day, 3.21 (95 % CI 2.34–4.40) for 100 g/day, and 5.20 (95 % CI 3.25–8.29) for 125 g/day of alcohol consumption.

"Murine precision-cut liver slices (PCLS): a new tool for studying tumor microenvironments and cell signaling ex vivo. One of the most insidious characteristics of cancer is its spread to and ability to compromise distant organs via the complex process of metastasis. Communication between cancer cells and organ-resident cells via cytokines/chemokines and direct cell-cell contacts are key steps for survival, proliferation and invasion of metastasized cancer cells in organs. Precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) are considered to closely reflect the in vivo situation and are potentially useful for studying the interaction of cancer cells with liver-resident cells as well as being a potentially useful tool for screening anti-cancer reagents. Application of the PCLS technique in the field of cancer research however, has not yet been well developed. We established the mouse PCLS system using perfluorodecalin (PFD) as an artificial oxygen carrier. Using this system we show that the adherence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive) cells to liver tissue in the PCLS was 5-fold greater than that of SK-BR-3 (less invasive) cells. In addition, we generated PCLS from THOC5, a member of transcription/export complex (TREX), knockout (KO) mice. The PCLS still expressed Gapdh or Albumin mRNAs at normal levels, while several chemokine/growth factor or metalloprotease genes, such as Cxcl12, Pdgfa, Tgfb, Wnt11, and Mmp1a genes were downregulated more than 2-fold. Interestingly, adhesion of cancer cells to THOC5 KO liver slices was far less (greater than 80% reduction) than to wild-type liver slices. Mouse PCLS cultures in the presence of PFD may serve as a useful tool for screening local adherence and invasiveness of individual cancer cells, since single cells can be observed. This method may also prove useful for identification of genes in liver-resident cells that support cancer invasion by using PCLS from transgenic liver.","murine precision-cut liver slices (pcls): a new tool for studying tumor microenvironments and cell signaling ex vivo. one of the most insidious characteristics of cancer is its spread to and ability to compromise distant organs via the complex process of metastasis. communication between cancer cells and organ-resident cells via cytokines/chemokines and direct cell-cell contacts are key steps for survival, proliferation and invasion of metastasized cancer cells in organs. precision-cut liver slices (pcls) are considered to closely reflect the in vivo situation and are potentially useful for studying the interaction of cancer cells with liver-resident cells as well as being a potentially useful tool for screening anti-cancer reagents. application of the pcls technique in the field of cancer research however, has not yet been well developed. we established the mouse pcls system using perfluorodecalin (pfd) as an artificial oxygen carrier. using this system we show that the adherence of green fluorescent",murine precision cut liver slice pcls new tool microenvironments cell signal ex vivo one insidious characteristic spread ability compromise distant organ via complex process metastasis communication cell organ resident cell via cytokine chemokines direct cell cell contact key step survival proliferation invasion metastasized cell organ precision cut liver slice pcls consider closely reflect vivo situation potentially useful interaction cell liver resident cell well potentially useful tool screen anti reagent application pcls technique field research however yet well develop establish mouse pcls system use perfluorodecalin pfd artificial oxygen carrier use system show adherence green fluorescent,b,Liver Cancer
"Pan-cancer analysis reveals correlation between RAB3B expression and tumor heterogeneity, immune microenvironment, and prognosis in multiple cancers. RAB3B is essential for the transportation and secretion within cells. Its increased expression is linked to the development and progression of various malignancies. However, understanding of RAB3B's involvement in carcinogenesis is mostly limited to specific cancer subtypes. Hence, exploring RAB3B's regulatory roles and molecular mechanisms through comprehensive cancer datasets might offer innovative approaches for managing clinical cancer. To examine the potential involvement of RAB3B in the development of cancer, we analyzed data from various sources including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), cBioPortal, HPA, UALCAN, and tissue microarray (TAM). Using bioinformatics techniques, we examined the correlation between RAB3B expression and prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, methylation modifications, and immune microenvironment across different cancer types. Our findings indicate that elevated RAB3B expression can independently predict prognosis in many tumors and has moderate accuracy for diagnosing most cancers. In most cancer types, we identified RAB3B mutations that showed a significant correlation with tumor mutational burden (TMB), mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Abnormal DNA methylation patterns were also observed in most cancers compared to normal tissues. Additionally, we found significant correlations between RAB3B expression, immune cell infiltration, and immune scores across various cancers. Through pan-cancer analysis, we observed significant differences in RAB3B expression levels between tumors and normal tissues, making it a potential primary factor for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The IHC results revealed that the expression of RAB3B in six types of tumors was consistent with the results of the pan-cancer analysis of the database. Furthermore, RAB3B showed potential associations with tumor heterogeneity and immunity. Thus, RAB3B can be utilized as an auxiliary diagnostic marker for early tumor detection and a prognostic biomarker for various tumor types.","pan-cancer analysis reveals correlation between rab3b expression and tumor heterogeneity, immune microenvironment, and prognosis in multiple cancers. rab3b is essential for the transportation and secretion within cells. its increased expression is linked to the development and progression of various malignancies. however, understanding of rab3b's involvement in carcinogenesis is mostly limited to specific cancer subtypes. hence, exploring rab3b's regulatory roles and molecular mechanisms through comprehensive cancer datasets might offer innovative approaches for managing clinical cancer. to examine the potential involvement of rab3b in the development of cancer, we analyzed data from various sources including the cancer genome atlas (tcga), genotype-tissue expression project (gtex), cbioportal, hpa, ualcan, and tissue microarray (tam). using bioinformatics techniques, we examined the correlation between rab3b expression and prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, methylation modifications, and immune microenvironment across different cancer types. our findings indicate that elevated rab3b expression can independently predict prognosis in many tumors and has moderate accuracy",pan reveal correlation rab b expression heterogeneity immune microenvironment prognosis multiple rab b essential transportation secretion within cell increased expression link development progression various malignancy however understand rab b involvement carcinogenesis mostly limit specific subtypes hence explore rab b regulatory role molecular mechanism comprehensive datasets might offer innovative approach manage examine potential involvement rab b development analyze data various source include genome atlas tcga genotype tissue expression project gtex cbioportal hpa ualcan tissue microarray tam use bioinformatics technique examine correlation rab b expression prognosis heterogeneity methylation modification immune microenvironment across different type finding indicate elevate rab b expression independently predict prognosis many moderate accuracy,b,Liver Cancer

"Laparoscopic deroofing for polycystic liver disease using laparoscopic fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. Laparoscopic deroofing is widely used for the treatment of symptomatic polycystic liver disease (PCLD). However, bile leakage is a common complication of surgical management for PCLD. Until now, indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (IGFI) has played an active role in hepatobiliary surgery. Herein, we report the effective application of a laparoscopic fusion IGFI system, known as PINPOINT, for laparoscopic deroofing.;  In this study, we performed laparoscopic deroofing for PCLD using the laparoscopic fusion IGFI system. We conducted the procedure mainly under the normal view mode, occasionally switching to the fusion IGFI mode. First, we confirmed that the liver cysts did not contain bile using the fusion IGFI mode and then used a percutaneous puncture needle to remove the fluid from some of the giant cysts. Second, using the fusion IGFI mode, we were able to detect thin biliary branches and to adjust the division line of the cyst wall accordingly or, occasionally, to ligate the branches. Finally, we searched for and identified unexpected small bile leakage and then closed it using sutures. The laparoscopic fusion IGFI system can simultaneously show fluorescent images, such as cholangiography and the liver parenchyma, on the normal color view. In the fusion IGFI mode, the intrahepatic bile duct and liver parenchyma can be easily discriminated in real time throughout the procedure. Accordingly, the laparoscopic fusion IGFI system is useful for the surgical treatment of PCLD, in which the boundary between the liver cysts and the liver parenchyma can otherwise be difficult to identify. This technique also enables the branches of Glisson’s capsule to be identified without any other intervention. The novel application of the laparoscopic fusion IGFI system allows reliable navigation for PCLD surgery.","laparoscopic deroofing for polycystic liver disease using laparoscopic fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. laparoscopic deroofing is widely used for the treatment of symptomatic polycystic liver disease (pcld). however, bile leakage is a common complication of surgical management for pcld. until now, indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (igfi) has played an active role in hepatobiliary surgery. herein, we report the effective application of a laparoscopic fusion igfi system, known as pinpoint, for laparoscopic deroofing.; in this study, we performed laparoscopic deroofing for pcld using the laparoscopic fusion igfi system. we conducted the procedure mainly under the normal view mode, occasionally switching to the fusion igfi mode. first, we confirmed that the liver cysts did not contain bile using the fusion igfi mode and then used a percutaneous puncture needle to remove the fluid from some of the giant cysts. second, using the fusion igfi mode, we were able to detect thin biliary",laparoscopic deroofing polycystic liver use laparoscopic fusion indocyanine green fluorescence image laparoscopic deroofing widely use symptomatic polycystic liver pcld however bile leakage common complication surgical management pcld indocyanine green fluorescence image igfi play active role hepatobiliary surgery herein report effective application laparoscopic fusion igfi system know pinpoint laparoscopic deroofing perform laparoscopic deroofing pcld use laparoscopic fusion igfi system conduct procedure mainly normal view mode occasionally switch fusion igfi mode first confirm liver cyst contain bile use fusion igfi mode use percutaneous puncture needle remove fluid giant cyst second use fusion igfi mode able detect thin biliary,b,Liver Cancer
"Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with malignant disease: report of two cases and a review of the literature Two cases of inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the liver associated with gastrointestinal tract cancer are reported. In addition, the etiological correlation between IPT and abscesses of the liver in cancer patients is discussed. The first patient was a 63-year-old woman who underwent distal gastrectomy and partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of stomach cancer with liver metastasis. The second patient was a 66-year-old man who had undergone surgery for rectal cancer 6 years previously and underwent partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of metastasis of rectal cancer to the liver. The gastric cancer was a papillary adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa, and the rectal cancer was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma limited to the subserosa. The resected liver tumor in the first case measured 5.5×5.0×4.0 cm and was 2.5×1.9×1.6 cm in the second. The cut surface showed that both masses were well circumscribed and divided into lobules by fibrous tissue. They were yellowish white in color and there was no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage. Histologically the masses consisted of fibrous areas and cellular areas, and the cellular areas consisted of fascicles of plump spindle cells mingled with varying numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. The masses were diagnosed as IPTs. Obliterating phlebitis suggesting infection via the portal vein was seen in the adjacent liver tissue in both cases. According to previous cases reported in the literature, there are three types of cancers associated with hepatic IPT: gastrointestinal tract cancer, biliary tract cancer, and cancers that need strong systemic chemotherapy.

"LncHOXA10 drives liver TICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis via HOXA10 transcription activation. Liver cancer is one of the most deadly cancers in the world. There are various cells in liver tumor bulk, including liver tumor initiating cells (TICs), which account for liver tumorigenesis, drug resistance, relapse and metastasis. The homeobox (HOX) transcription factors play critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, while, their roles in liver TICs and liver tumorigenesis remain unknown. An unbiased screening was performed using online-available datasets. Liver TICs were sorted by FACS using surface markers CD133, CD13 and EPCAM, or enriched by oncosphere formation assay. TIC self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. Loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncRNA. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, ChIP, Western blot and double FISH were used to explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA. Here, we examined the expression pattern of HOX transcription factors, and found HOXA10 was overexpressed in liver cancer samples. Moreover, a divergent lncRNA of HOXA10 (termed lncHOXA10 hereafter) was also highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncHOXA10 drove liver TIC self-renewal and liver tumorigenesis through HOXA10-dependent manner. LncHOXA10 interacted with SNF2L and recruited NURF chromatin remodeling complex to HOXA10 promoter, and thus initiated the transcription of HOXA10. Through HOXA10 transcriptional regulation, lncHOXA10 activated HOXA10 in liver TICs. LncHOXA10-HOXA10 signaling can be targeted to eliminate liver TICs. Altogether, lncHOXA10 drove HOXA10 expression and thus promoted liver TIC self-renewal. HOXA10 was the most highly expressed HOX transcription factor in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncHOXA10 drove the transcriptional activation of HOXA10. This work revealed the important role of HOX transcription factor in liver TIC self-renewal and added a new layer for liver TIC regulation.","lnchoxa10 drives liver tics self-renewal and tumorigenesis via hoxa10 transcription activation. liver cancer is one of the most deadly cancers in the world. there are various cells in liver tumor bulk, including liver tumor initiating cells (tics), which account for liver tumorigenesis, drug resistance, relapse and metastasis. the homeobox (hox) transcription factors play critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, while, their roles in liver tics and liver tumorigenesis remain unknown. an unbiased screening was performed using online-available datasets. liver tics were sorted by facs using surface markers cd133, cd13 and epcam, or enriched by oncosphere formation assay. tic self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncrna. rna pulldown, rna immunoprecipitation, chip, western blot and double fish were used to explore the molecular mechanism of lncrna. here, we examined the expression",lnchoxa drive liver tic self renewal tumorigenesis via hoxa transcription activation liver one deadly world various cell liver bulk include liver initiate cell tic account liver tumorigenesis drug resistance relapse metastasis homeobox hox transcription factor play critical role many physiological pathological process role liver tic liver tumorigenesis remain unknown unbiased screening perform use online available datasets liver tic sort facs use surface marker cd cd epcam enrich oncosphere formation assay tic self renewal examine oncosphere formation initiation assay loss function gain function assay perform examine role lncrna rna pulldown rna immunoprecipitation chip western blot double fish use explore molecular mechanism lncrna examine expression,b,Liver Cancer
"Granulin-epithelin precursor interacts with 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein in hepatocellular carcinoma Granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP) is a secretory growth factor, which has been demonstrated to control cancer growth, invasion, drug resistance and immune escape. Our previous studies and others also demonstrated its potential in targeted therapy. Comprehensive characterization of GEP partner on cancer cells are warranted. We have previously shown that GEP interacted with heparan sulfate on the surface of liver cancer cells and the interaction is crucial for GEP-mediated signaling transduction. This study aims to characterize GEP protein partner at the cell membrane with the co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry approach. The membrane fraction from liver cancer model Hep3B was used for capturing binding partner with the specific monoclonal antibody against GEP. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. After identifying the GEP binding partner, this specific interaction was validated in additional liver cancer cell line HepG2 by co-immunoprecipitation using GRP78 and GEP antibodies, respectively, as the bait. GRP78 transcript levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical samples (n = 77 pairs) were examined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. GEP and GRP78 protein expressions were investigated by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections. We identified the GEP-binding protein as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78, also named heat shock 70-kDa protein 5, HSPA5). This interaction was validated in independent HCC cell lines. Increased GRP78 mRNA levels were demonstrated in liver cancer tissues compared with the paralleled liver tissues (t-test, P = 0.002). GRP78 and GEP transcript levels were significantly correlated (Spearman’s correlation, P = 0.001), and the proteins were also detectable in the cytoplasm of liver cancer cells by immunohistochemical staining.

"Identification and Characterization of Cadmium-Related Genes in Liver Carcinoma. Evidence indicates that exposure to heavy trace element might be a risk factor for liver carcinoma. Cadmium has been supposed to be a carcinogen that has a correlation with the risk of a number of cancers, including liver cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying Cadmium-induced malignant transformation in liver cells are not fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that might play a role in both the Cadmium-related liver cell transformation and the development of liver cancer. Microarray-based gene expression profiles concerning liver carcinoma vs non-cancerous tissue (GSE64041) and Cadmium-treated liver cells vs controls (GSE8865 and GSE31286), respectively, were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, DEGs of each profile were calculated and screened. The intersection of each DEGs was obtained by Venn analysis. Afterwards, the possible roles of the selected genes in cancer development were evaluated by using Oncomine database and TCGA cohort analysis. Consequently, three DEGs, LRAT, SLC7A11, and ITGA2, were selected for further analysis. SLC7A11 and ITGA2, but not LRAT, were upregulated in liver cancer compared with those in normal tissues, respectively. After using a TCGA cohort analysis, results failed to show a significant correlation between SLC7A11 or ITGA2 expression and clinical parameters. However, the survival analysis showed that patients with high expression levels of SLC7A11 had a shorter overall survival time relative to those of the patients with low levels. In conclusion, SLC7A11 and ITGA2 might play a role in the Cadmium-induced liver cell damage or transformation, and the development of liver carcinoma. SLC7A11 might be a prognostic factor for patients with liver carcinoma. Future validation experiments are needed to verify the results.","identification and characterization of cadmium-related genes in liver carcinoma. evidence indicates that exposure to heavy trace element might be a risk factor for liver carcinoma. cadmium has been supposed to be a carcinogen that has a correlation with the risk of a number of cancers, including liver cancer. however, the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced malignant transformation in liver cells are not fully understood. in the present study, we aimed to screen the differentially expressed genes (degs) that might play a role in both the cadmium-related liver cell transformation and the development of liver cancer. microarray-based gene expression profiles concerning liver carcinoma vs non-cancerous tissue (gse64041) and cadmium-treated liver cells vs controls (gse8865 and gse31286), respectively, were retrieved from gene expression omnibus (geo) database. then, degs of each profile were calculated and screened. the intersection of each degs was obtained by venn analysis. afterwards, the possible roles of the selected genes in",identification characterization cadmium relate gene liver carcinoma evidence indicate exposure heavy trace element might risk factor liver carcinoma cadmium suppose carcinogen correlation risk number include liver however mechanism underlie cadmium induce malignant transformation liver cell fully understand present screen differentially express gene degs might play role cadmium relate liver cell transformation development liver microarray base gene expression profile concern liver carcinoma v non cancerous tissue gse cadmium treat liver cell vs control gse gse respectively retrieve gene expression omnibus geo database degs profile calculate screen intersection degs obtain venn afterwards possible role select gene,b,Liver Cancer

"Constitutive TDO2 expression promotes liver cancer progression by an autocrine IL-6 signaling pathway. Background Increased tryptophan (Trp) metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) represents one of the most studied pathways for immunosuppression in tumor tissues. However, the pro-tumor effects induced by Trp metabolism remain controversial. Methods The paraffin sections of tumor tissues were obtained from patients with liver cancer and examined by immunohistochemical staining to investigate the role of Trp metabolic enzymes. To further confirm the pro-tumor effects induced by TDO2, we established TDO2 overexpression SMC-7721 and HepG2 liver cancer cell lines, and western blotting, cell proliferation, and colony formation were evaluated. Meanwhile, liver cancer subcutaneous mice models were established, and the tumorigenic rates of SMC-7721 cells, tumor volume and survival of bearing mice were calculated. In addition, the survival data of liver cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded to analyze the effect of TDO2 expression on the survival of patients with liver cancer. Results Here, we showed that constitutive TDO2 expression gave rise to liver cancer through upregulation of Trp metabolism. And the TDO2 expression was positively correlated with the poor prognosis in liver cancer patients. TDO2 expression in tumor cells accounted for the release of kynurenine (Kyn), which activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to promote liver cancer cells proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that AhR expression contributed to the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), thereby promoting tumor cells proliferation through the STAT3 and NF-kB/TIM4 signals. Interrupt of AhR signals by PDM2 revealed improved outcomes in subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Together, our study showed that the TDO2/Kyn/AhR/IL-6 signaling pathway was a novel mechanism underlying the malignancy of liver cancer, and suggested that AhR signals might be a valuable therapeutic target for tumor therapy.","constitutive tdo2 expression promotes liver cancer progression by an autocrine il-6 signaling pathway. background increased tryptophan (trp) metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido)/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (tdo) represents one of the most studied pathways for immunosuppression in tumor tissues. however, the pro-tumor effects induced by trp metabolism remain controversial. methods the paraffin sections of tumor tissues were obtained from patients with liver cancer and examined by immunohistochemical staining to investigate the role of trp metabolic enzymes. to further confirm the pro-tumor effects induced by tdo2, we established tdo2 overexpression smc-7721 and hepg2 liver cancer cell lines, and western blotting, cell proliferation, and colony formation were evaluated. meanwhile, liver cancer subcutaneous mice models were established, and the tumorigenic rates of smc-7721 cells, tumor volume and survival of bearing mice were calculated. in addition, the survival data of liver cancer patients from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) database were downloaded to analyze the effect of",constitutive tdo expression promote liver progression autocrine il signal pathway increase tryptophan trp metabolism indoleamine dioxygenase ido tryptophan dioxygenase tdo represent one studied pathway immunosuppression tissue however pro effect induce trp metabolism remain controversial method paraffin section tissue obtain liver examine immunohistochemical staining investigate role trp metabolic enzyme confirm pro effect induce tdo establish tdo overexpression smc hepg liver cell line western blotting cell proliferation colony formation evaluate meanwhile liver subcutaneous mouse model establish tumorigenic rate smc cell volume survival bear mouse calculate addition survival data liver genome atlas tcga database download analyze effect,b,Liver Cancer

"Decreased hepatic function in patients with hepatoma or liver metastasis monitored by a hepatocyte specific galactosylated radioligand. 99mTc-galactosylated neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA) is a hepatocyte-specific tracer that, after injection into the blood stream, delivers radioactivity selectively to the liver. This is based upon chemical recognition and binding by the hepatic binding protein (HBP), a receptor specific for galactosylated glycoproteins. Liver tissue samples were obtained intraoperatively from patients undergoing surgery for various cancers. The concentration of specific HBP receptors in the liver (normal liver, hepatoma, liver metastasis) was calculated from the in vitro binding of 99mTc-NGA. One week after surgery, the in vivo HBP density was also measured in some of these patients after injection of 3.5 mg (50 nmol per patient) 99mTc-NGA (150-200 MBq) for simulation of 99mTc-NGA kinetics. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo HBP concentration in the liver showed values in the same concentration range. In patients with hepatoma or liver metastasis a significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased global HBP density was found in vivo compared to controls. The values obtained for in vivo HBP concentration in the liver amounted to 0.38 +/- 0.05 mumol l-1 liver for patients with hepatoma, to 0.4 +/- 0.1 mumol l-1 in patients with liver metastasis and to 94 +/- 0.05 mumol l-1 liver in cancer patients without liver malignancy. In vitro investigation of HBP density revealed the malignant liver tissue to have a significantly (P less than 0.0001) decreased or almost (completely) absent HBP receptor density compared to the normal tissue apart from the cancer area. It is concluded that determination of HBP density in vivo via a specific tracer is a new, simple and reliable approach for the determination of remaining hepatic function in patients with primary or secondary liver cancer.","decreased hepatic function in patients with hepatoma or liver metastasis monitored by a hepatocyte specific galactosylated radioligand. 99mtc-galactosylated neoglycoalbumin (99mtc-nga) is a hepatocyte-specific tracer that, after injection into the blood stream, delivers radioactivity selectively to the liver. this is based upon chemical recognition and binding by the hepatic binding protein (hbp), a receptor specific for galactosylated glycoproteins. liver tissue samples were obtained intraoperatively from patients undergoing surgery for various cancers. the concentration of specific hbp receptors in the liver (normal liver, hepatoma, liver metastasis) was calculated from the in vitro binding of 99mtc-nga. one week after surgery, the in vivo hbp density was also measured in some of these patients after injection of 3.5 mg (50 nmol per patient) 99mtc-nga (150-200 mbq) for simulation of 99mtc-nga kinetics. comparison of in vitro and in vivo hbp concentration in the liver showed values in the same concentration range. in patients with hepatoma",decrease hepatic function hepatoma liver metastasis monitor hepatocyte specific galactosylated radioligand mtc galactosylated neoglycoalbumin mtc nga hepatocyte specific tracer injection blood stream delivers radioactivity selectively liver base upon chemical recognition binding hepatic binding protein hbp receptor specific galactosylated glycoprotein liver tissue sample obtain intraoperatively undergo surgery various concentration specific hbp receptor liver normal liver hepatoma liver metastasis calculate vitro binding mtc nga one week surgery vivo hbp density also measure injection mg nmol per mtc nga mbq simulation mtc nga kinetics comparison vitro vivo hbp concentration liver show value concentration range hepatoma,b,Liver Cancer

"The diagnostic value of miR-21 combined with CT in patients with liver cancer. To explore the diagnostic value of miR-21 combined with computed tomography (CT) in patients with liver cancer. A total of 112 patients in our hospital were confirmed liver cancer by examination, and were collected as cancer group. Another 100 patients with hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia in the same period were collected as control group. The diagnostic value of miR-21 and CT on liver cancer was observed. The level of miR-21 in cancer group was significantly higher than that in control group, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was tested. It was found that the AFP level in cancer group was significantly higher than that in control group (p < 0.001). The correlation between AFP and miR-21 levels in liver cancer patients was detected. It turned out that AFP and miR-21 had correlation. According to receiver operating curve (ROC) calculation results, the best cut-off value for miR-21 diagnosis was 4.142.

"Mass screening for liver cancer: results from a demonstration screening project in Zhongshan City, China. Current Chinese national guidelines recommend routine screening for liver cancer in patients positive for HBsAg, irrespective of fibrosis status, age, or family history of liver cancer. We aim to evaluate whether the recommended screening strategy could reduce liver-cancer-specific mortality. We conducted a liver cancer mass screening trial in Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan City, China, among residents aged 35–64 years in 2012. All volunteers were offered serological testing for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). We proposed biannual screening using serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasonography examination for subjects positive for HBsAg. Among 17,966 participants (26.2% of 68,510 eligible residents) who were free of liver cancer at baseline in 2012, we identified 57 incident cases of liver cancer within the first 4 years of follow-up (i.e., 43 among 2,848 HBsAg-positive participants and 14 among 15,118 HBsAg-negative participants), compared with 104 cases identified in non-participants (N = 50,544). A total of 207 participants had the recommended number of ultrasonography examinations (every 6 months) during the screening period. Compared with cases identified from non-participants, the cases arising among participants were more likely to be at early stage and had better survival than those among non-participants. However, we did not observe a reduction in liver cancer-specific mortality rate among participants (relative risk = 1.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.68, 1.58, P = 0.856). Our demonstration screening study does not show a reduction in liver cancer mortality within the first 4 years of follow-up according to current guidance in China, although long-term efficacy remains to be evaluated. Targeted surveillance among high-risk individuals as recommended by international guidelines, along with measures to improve compliance, should be evaluated in the Chinese population.","mass screening for liver cancer: results from a demonstration screening project in zhongshan city, china. current chinese national guidelines recommend routine screening for liver cancer in patients positive for hbsag, irrespective of fibrosis status, age, or family history of liver cancer. we aim to evaluate whether the recommended screening strategy could reduce liver-cancer-specific mortality. we conducted a liver cancer mass screening trial in xiaolan town, zhongshan city, china, among residents aged 35–64 years in 2012. all volunteers were offered serological testing for hepatitis b virus surface antigen (hbsag). we proposed biannual screening using serum alpha-fetoprotein (afp) and ultrasonography examination for subjects positive for hbsag. among 17,966 participants (26.2% of 68,510 eligible residents) who were free of liver cancer at baseline in 2012, we identified 57 incident cases of liver cancer within the first 4 years of follow-up (i.e., 43 among 2,848 hbsag-positive participants and 14 among 15,118 hbsag-negative participants), compared",mass screen liver result demonstration screen project zhongshan city china current chinese national guideline recommend routine screening liver positive hbsag irrespective fibrosis status age family history liver evaluate whether recommended screening strategy could reduce liver specific mortality conduct liver mass screen trial xiaolan town zhongshan city china among resident age year volunteer offer serological test hepatitis b virus surface antigen hbsag propose biannual screening use serum alpha fetoprotein afp ultrasonography examination subject positive hbsag among participant eligible resident free liver baseline identify incident liver within first year follow e among hbsag positive participant among hbsag negative participant compare,b,Liver Cancer
"RNF157 targets RIG-I/DDX58 to promote proliferation in liver cancer. Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours in humans, and a large proportion of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to rapid growth and distant metastasis; thus, there is an urgent need to identify critical genes involved in the development of liver cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of RING finger protein 157 (RNF157) in liver cancer proliferation and the related mechanisms. First, we used bioinformatics counting for database mining of RNF157 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and paracancerous tissues and its relationship with prognosis. We detected the expression level of RNF157 in human samples and different liver cancer cell lines via fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, virus transfection was used to construct knockdown and overexpressed stably transfected cell lines to test the effect of RNF157 on the proliferation of liver cancer. Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was used to verify the binding and regulatory relationship between RNF157 and RIG-I/DDX58. We found that RNF157 expression was significantly upregulated in liver cancer tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, knockdown of RNF157 expression inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation and overexpression of RNF157 promoted liver cancer cell proliferation. Co-IP results revealed that RNF157 binds to and downregulates the expression level of RIG-I/DDX58, further suggesting that RNF157 binds to and ubiquitinates RIG-I/DDX58 at residue 48 of the lysine, which leads to a significant increase in the expression level of RIG-I/DDX58. In this study, we found that RNF157 is a tumour-promoting ubiquitin ligase that promotes liver cancer growth by targeting RIG-I/DDX58 for degradation. Thus, RNF157 has the potential to be a therapeutic target for liver cancer.","rnf157 targets rig-i/ddx58 to promote proliferation in liver cancer. liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours in humans, and a large proportion of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to rapid growth and distant metastasis; thus, there is an urgent need to identify critical genes involved in the development of liver cancer. in this study, we investigated the role of ring finger protein 157 (rnf157) in liver cancer proliferation and the related mechanisms. first, we used bioinformatics counting for database mining of rnf157 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and paracancerous tissues and its relationship with prognosis. we detected the expression level of rnf157 in human samples and different liver cancer cell lines via fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr), western blot, and immunohistochemistry (ihc). subsequently, virus transfection was used to construct knockdown and overexpressed stably transfected cell lines to test the effect of rnf157 on the",rnf target rig ddx promote proliferation liver liver one common malignant human large proportion diagnose advanced stage due rapid growth distant metastasis thus urgent need identify critical gene involve development liver investigate role ring finger protein rnf liver proliferation related mechanism first use bioinformatics count database mining rnf expression hepatocellular carcinoma paracancerous tissue relationship prognosis detect expression level rnf human sample different liver cell line via fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr western blot immunohistochemistry ihc subsequently virus transfection use construct knockdown overexpressed stably transfected cell line test effect rnf,b,Liver Cancer
"Incidence and mortality rates of selected infection-related cancers in Puerto Rico and in the United States Background: In 2002, 17.8% of the global cancer burden was attributable to infections. This study assessed the agestandardized incidence and mortality rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) for the period 19922003 and compared them to those of Hispanics (USH), non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) in the United States (US). Methods: Age-standardized rates [ASR(World)] were calculated based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the PR Cancer Central Registry and SEER, using the direct method and the world population as the standard. Annual percent changes (APC) were calculated using the Poisson regression model from 1992-2003. Results: The incidence and mortality rates from stomach, liver and cervical cancer were lower in NHW than PR; with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer which was similar in both populations. Meanwhile, the incidence rates of stomach, liver and cervical cancers were similar between NHB and PR; except for NHB women who had a lower incidence rate of liver cancer than women in PR. NHB had a lower mortality from liver cancer than persons in PR, and similar mortality from stomach cancer. Conclusions: The burden of liver, stomach, and cervical cancer in PR compares to that of USH and NHB and continues to be a public health priority. Public health efforts are necessary to further decrease the burden of cancers associated to infections in these groups, the largest minority population groups in the US. Future studies need to identify factors that may prevent infections with cancer-related agents in these populations. Strategies to increase the use of preventive strategies, such as vaccination and screening, among minority populations should also be developed.","incidence and mortality rates of selected infection-related cancers in puerto rico and in the united states background: in 2002, 17.8% of the global cancer burden was attributable to infections. this study assessed the agestandardized incidence and mortality rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancer in puerto rico (pr) for the period 19922003 and compared them to those of hispanics (ush), non-hispanic whites (nhw), and non-hispanic blacks (nhb) in the united states (us). methods: age-standardized rates [asr(world)] were calculated based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the pr cancer central registry and seer, using the direct method and the world population as the standard. annual percent changes (apc) were calculated using the poisson regression model from 1992-2003. results: the incidence and mortality rates from stomach, liver and cervical cancer were lower in nhw than pr; with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer which was similar in both populations. meanwhile,",incidence mortality rate select infection relate puerto rico united state global burden attributable infections assess agestandardized incidence mortality rate stomach liver cervical puerto rico pr period compare hispanic ush non hispanic white nhw non hispanic black nhb united state u method age standardize rate asr world calculate base incidence mortality data pr central registry seer use direct method world population standard annual percent change apc calculate use poisson regression model result incidence mortality rate stomach liver cervical low nhw pr exception mortality cervical similar population meanwhile,b,Liver Cancer
"Hepatic proliferation after partial liver irradiation in Sprague–Dawley rats The liver has powerful capability to proliferate in response to various injuries, but little is known as to liver proliferation after irradiation (IR) injury. This study investigated whether liver proliferation could be stimulated in low-dose irradiated liver by partial liver IR injury with high dose radiation. Sprague–Dawley rats were irradiated by 6-MV X-ray with single dose of 25 Gy to the right-half liver, while the left-half liver was shielded (0.7 Gy) or irradiated with single doses of 3.2, 5.6, and 8.0 Gy, respectively. Hepatic proliferation in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half liver was evaluated by serum hepatic growth factor (HGF), proliferating cell nuclei antigen (PCNA), liver proliferation index (PI), hepatocyte mitosis index (MI). The observation time was 0 day (before IR), 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after IR. Our results showed that serum HGF and hepatocyte HGF mRNA increased after IR with HGF mRNA peak on day 30 in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half livers, and their values increased as the dose increased to the left-half liver. Liver PI and PCNA mRNA peaked on day 60 with stronger expressions in higher doses-irradiated livers. MI increased after IR, with the peak noted on day 60 in the shielded and on day 90 in the low-dose irradiated left-half livers. There was a 30 day delay between MI peaks in the shielded and low-dose irradiated livers. In conclusion, 25 Gy partial liver IR injury could stimulate the shielded liver and low-dose irradiated liver to proliferate. In the livers receiving a dose range of 3.2–8.0 Gy, the proliferation was stronger in higher doses-irradiated liver than the low-dose irradiated.

"A novel liver retraction method in laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer Retracting the lateral liver segment during laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is important for achieving an optimal surgical field. However, excessive force may injure the liver, causing temporary abnormalities of liver function tests after laparoscopic surgery. We developed a new liver retraction method and assessed its safety and utility. We retrospectively analyzed records in our surgical database of consecutive surgical patients who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. We divided the 229 patients into two groups based on the liver retraction method used, either flexible liver retraction with clipping and suturing (FLICS) or the Nathanson retractor (NR). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to match patients, resulting in the records of 53 pairs of cases extracted from the database. Operative and postoperative outcomes were assessed, including following the values of serum liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein until postoperative day 30. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or preoperative data in the two groups. The retraction method was not changed intraoperatively for any patients. The operative time was significantly shorter in the FLICS group, but the amount of bleeding did not differ. Liver injury was not observed as a result of liver retraction during surgery. In both groups, serum liver enzymes temporarily increased after surgery but improved rapidly thereafter. The postoperative increases in aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in the FLICS than in the NR group. No serious complications associated with liver retraction were observed in either group. Our new liver retraction technique provided an optimal surgical field without inducing liver dysfunction.

"Inhibition of USP7 enhances CD8+ T cell activity in liver cancer by suppressing PRDM1-mediated FGL1 upregulation. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), an immune checkpoint molecule expressed on activated T cells, functions as a negative regulator of immune responses. Persistent antigen exposure in the tumor microenvironment results in sustained LAG3 expression on T cells, contributing to T cell dysfunction. Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) has been identified as a major ligand of LAG3, and FGL1/LAG3 interaction forms a novel immune checkpoint pathway that results in tumor immune evasion. In addition, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) plays a crucial role in cancer development. In this study we investigated the role of USP7 in modulation of FGL1-mediated liver cancer immune evasion. We showed that knockdown of USP7 or treatment with USP7 inhibitor P5091 suppressed liver cancer growth by promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity in Hepa1-6 xenograft mice and in HepG2 or Huh7 cells co-cultured with T cells, whereas USP7 overexpression produced the opposite effect. We found that USP7 upregulated FGL1 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells by deubiquitination of transcriptional factor PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1), which transcriptionally activated FGL1, and attenuated the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity, leading to the liver cancer growth. Interestingly, USP7 could be transcriptionally stimulated by PRDM1 as well in a positive feedback loop. P5091, an inhibitor of USP7, was able to downregulate FGL1 expression, thus enhancing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity. In an immunocompetent liver cancer mouse model, the dual blockade of USP7 and LAG3 resulted in a superior antitumor activity compared with anti-LAG3 therapy alone. We conclude that USP7 diminishes CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity by a USP7/PRDM1 positive feedback loop on FGL1 production in liver cancer; USP7 might be a promising target for liver cancer immunotherapy.","inhibition of usp7 enhances cd8+ t cell activity in liver cancer by suppressing prdm1-mediated fgl1 upregulation. lymphocyte activation gene 3 (lag3), an immune checkpoint molecule expressed on activated t cells, functions as a negative regulator of immune responses. persistent antigen exposure in the tumor microenvironment results in sustained lag3 expression on t cells, contributing to t cell dysfunction. fibrinogen-like protein 1 (fgl1) has been identified as a major ligand of lag3, and fgl1/lag3 interaction forms a novel immune checkpoint pathway that results in tumor immune evasion. in addition, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (usp7) plays a crucial role in cancer development. in this study we investigated the role of usp7 in modulation of fgl1-mediated liver cancer immune evasion. we showed that knockdown of usp7 or treatment with usp7 inhibitor p5091 suppressed liver cancer growth by promoting cd8 + t cell activity in hepa1-6 xenograft mice and in hepg2 or huh7 cells co-cultured",inhibition usp enhances cd cell activity liver suppress prdm mediate fgl upregulation lymphocyte activation gene lag immune checkpoint molecule express activated cell function negative regulator immune response persistent antigen exposure microenvironment result sustained lag expression cell contribute cell dysfunction fibrinogen like protein fgl identify major ligand lag fgl lag interaction form novel immune checkpoint pathway result immune evasion addition ubiquitin specific peptidase usp play crucial role development investigate role usp modulation fgl mediate liver immune evasion show knockdown usp usp inhibitor p suppress liver growth promote cd cell activity hepa xenograft mouse hepg huh cell co culture,b,Liver Cancer
"Convergent somatic mutations in metabolism genes in chronic liver disease The progression of chronic liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma is caused by the acquisition of somatic mutations that affect 20–30 cancer genes1–8. Burdens of somatic mutations are higher and clonal expansions larger in chronic liver disease9–13 than in normal liver13–16, which enables positive selection to shape the genomic landscape9–13. Here we analysed somatic mutations from 1,590 genomes across 34 liver samples, including healthy controls, alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Seven of the 29 patients with liver disease had mutations in FOXO1, the major transcription factor in insulin signalling. These mutations affected a single hotspot within the gene, impairing the insulin-mediated nuclear export of FOXO1. Notably, six of the seven patients with FOXO1S22W hotspot mutations showed convergent evolution, with variants acquired independently by up to nine distinct hepatocyte clones per patient. CIDEB, which regulates lipid droplet metabolism in hepatocytes17–19, and GPAM, which produces storage triacylglycerol from free fatty acids20,21, also had a significant excess of mutations. We again observed frequent convergent evolution: up to fourteen independent clones per patient with CIDEB mutations and up to seven clones per patient with GPAM mutations. Mutations in metabolism genes were distributed across multiple anatomical segments of the liver, increased clone size and were seen in both alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma. Master regulators of metabolic pathways are a frequent target of convergent somatic mutation in alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of somatic mutations in liver samples from patients with chronic liver disease identifies driver mutations in metabolism-related genes such as FOXO1, and shows that these variants frequently exhibit convergent evolution.","convergent somatic mutations in metabolism genes in chronic liver disease the progression of chronic liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma is caused by the acquisition of somatic mutations that affect 20–30 cancer genes1–8. burdens of somatic mutations are higher and clonal expansions larger in chronic liver disease9–13 than in normal liver13–16, which enables positive selection to shape the genomic landscape9–13. here we analysed somatic mutations from 1,590 genomes across 34 liver samples, including healthy controls, alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. seven of the 29 patients with liver disease had mutations in foxo1, the major transcription factor in insulin signalling. these mutations affected a single hotspot within the gene, impairing the insulin-mediated nuclear export of foxo1. notably, six of the seven patients with foxo1s22w hotspot mutations showed convergent evolution, with variants acquired independently by up to nine distinct hepatocyte clones per patient. cideb, which regulates lipid droplet metabolism in",convergent somatic mutation metabolism gene chronic liver progression chronic liver hepatocellular carcinoma cause acquisition somatic mutation affect gene burden somatic mutation high clonal expansion large chronic liver normal liver enable positive selection shape genomic landscape analyse somatic mutation genome across liver sample include healthy control alcohol relate liver non alcoholic fatty liver seven liver mutation foxo major transcription factor insulin signal mutation affect single hotspot within gene impair insulin mediate nuclear export foxo notably six seven foxo w hotspot mutation show convergent evolution variant acquire independently nine distinct hepatocyte clone per cideb regulate lipid droplet metabolism,b,Liver Cancer
"A natural process of cirrhosis resolution and deceleration of liver regeneration after thioacetamide withdrawal in a rat model Characteristics of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver cirrhosis in rat was observed for 120 days after TAA withdrawal as part of the radiobiological study of partial liver irradiation on TAA-induced cirrhotic rats. The natural process focused on cirrhosis and regeneration was recorded as a baseline condition for the interpretation of the outcome of the partial liver irradiation study. Cirrhosis in rats was successfully induced by drinking 0.03% TAA water orally for 29 weeks with a modeling rate of 96%. After establishment of the cirrhosis model, the rats were observed for 120 days upon TAA withdrawal to investigate the dynamic changes of cirrhosis and regeneration. The following characteristics were observed: (1) Histological changes; (2) Liver functions; (3) Cirrhosis: trichrome stain, quantification of hydroxyproline in hydrolysed liver tissue and TGF-β1; (4) Liver regeneration: liver index, hepatocyte mitotic index (MI), hepatocyte proliferation index (PI) by flow cytometry, PCNA labeling index (LI) by IHC and expression of PCNA mRNA; and (5) Growth factors: serum HGF, VEGF, TGF-α, and IL-6. After TAA withdrawal, gradual improvement in liver functions was noted with decreases of ALT, AST, and ALP, and increase of PA. The resolution of cirrhosis was evident by histological improvement with attenuation of collagen fiber and decrease of TGF-β1 IHC index, and also decrease of trichrome stain and hydroxyproline content. However, cirrhosis was still existed on 120 days after TAA withdrawal. Significant deceleration of liver regeneration was demonstrated with TAA withdrawal, evidenced by decrease of MI and PI, reduced expression of PCNA mRNA and PCNA LI. In conclusion, upon TAA withdrawal hepatic cirrhosis was continuously resolved, but persisted up to 120 days, and liver regeneration was significantly decelerated.","a natural process of cirrhosis resolution and deceleration of liver regeneration after thioacetamide withdrawal in a rat model characteristics of thioacetamide (taa)-induced liver cirrhosis in rat was observed for 120 days after taa withdrawal as part of the radiobiological study of partial liver irradiation on taa-induced cirrhotic rats. the natural process focused on cirrhosis and regeneration was recorded as a baseline condition for the interpretation of the outcome of the partial liver irradiation study. cirrhosis in rats was successfully induced by drinking 0.03% taa water orally for 29 weeks with a modeling rate of 96%. after establishment of the cirrhosis model, the rats were observed for 120 days upon taa withdrawal to investigate the dynamic changes of cirrhosis and regeneration. the following characteristics were observed: (1) histological changes; (2) liver functions; (3) cirrhosis: trichrome stain, quantification of hydroxyproline in hydrolysed liver tissue and tgf-β1; (4) liver regeneration: liver index, hepatocyte",natural process cirrhosis resolution deceleration liver regeneration thioacetamide withdrawal rat model characteristic thioacetamide taa induce liver cirrhosis rat observe day taa withdrawal part radiobiological partial liver irradiation taa induce cirrhotic rat natural process focus cirrhosis regeneration record baseline condition interpretation outcome partial liver irradiation cirrhosis rat successfully induce drink taa water orally week model rate establishment cirrhosis model rat observe day upon taa withdrawal investigate dynamic change cirrhosis regeneration following characteristic observe histological change liver function cirrhosis trichrome stain quantification hydroxyproline hydrolysed liver tissue tgf liver regeneration liver index hepatocyte,b,Liver Cancer

"Process of hepatic metastasis from pancreatic cancer: biology with clinical significance. Pancreatic cancer shows a remarkable preference for the liver to establish secondary tumors. Selective metastasis to the liver is attributed to the development of potential microenvironment for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. This review aims to provide a full understanding of the hepatic metastatic process from circulating pancreatic cancer cells to their settlement in the liver, serving as a basic theory for efficient prediction and treatment of metastatic diseases. A systematic search of relevant original articles and reviews was performed on PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for the purpose of this review. Three interrelated phases are delineated as the contributions of the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and the liver to hepatic metastasis process. Chemotaxis of disseminated pancreatic cancer cells and simultaneous defensive formation of platelets or neutrophils facilitate specific metastasis toward the liver. Remodeling of extracellular matrix and stromal cells in hepatic lobules and angiogenesis induced by proangiogenic factors support the survival and growth of clinical micrometastasis colonizing the liver. The bimodal role of the immune system or prevalence of cancer cells over the immune system makes metastatic progression successfully proceed from micrometastasis to macrometastasis. Pancreatic cancer is an appropriate research object of cancer metastasis representing more than a straight cascade. If any of the successive or simultaneous phases, especially tumor-induced immunosuppression, is totally disrupted, hepatic metastasis will be temporarily under control or even cancelled forever. To shrink cancers on multiple fronts and prolong survival for patients, novel oral or intravenous anti-cancer agents covering one or different phases of metastatic pancreatic cancer are expected to be integrated into innovative strategies on the premise of safety and efficacious biostability.","process of hepatic metastasis from pancreatic cancer: biology with clinical significance. pancreatic cancer shows a remarkable preference for the liver to establish secondary tumors. selective metastasis to the liver is attributed to the development of potential microenvironment for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. this review aims to provide a full understanding of the hepatic metastatic process from circulating pancreatic cancer cells to their settlement in the liver, serving as a basic theory for efficient prediction and treatment of metastatic diseases. a systematic search of relevant original articles and reviews was performed on pubmed, embase and cochrane library for the purpose of this review. three interrelated phases are delineated as the contributions of the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and the liver to hepatic metastasis process. chemotaxis of disseminated pancreatic cancer cells and simultaneous defensive formation of platelets or neutrophils facilitate specific metastasis toward the liver. remodeling of extracellular matrix",process hepatic metastasis pancreatic biology significance pancreatic show remarkable preference liver establish secondary selective metastasis liver attribute development potential microenvironment survival pancreatic cell review provide full understanding hepatic metastatic process circulate pancreatic cell settlement liver serving basic theory efficient prediction metastatic systematic search relevant original article review perform embase cochrane library review three interrelated phase delineate contribution interaction pancreatic cell liver hepatic metastasis process chemotaxis disseminated pancreatic cell simultaneous defensive formation platelet neutrophil facilitate specific metastasis toward liver remodeling extracellular matrix,b,Liver Cancer
"LncGPR107 drives the self-renewal of liver tumor initiating cells and liver tumorigenesis through GPR107-dependent manner With self-renewal and differentiation properties, liver tumor initiating cells (TICs) are the reasons for tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance. G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are critical modulators in many physiological and pathological processes. While, their roles in liver TICs are unknown. An unbiased screening was performed using online-available data dataset. Liver TICs were sorted by FACS with surface marker CD133, or enriched by oncosphere formation. TIC self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. Loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncRNA. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, ChIP, western blot and double FISH were used explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA. We performed an unbiased screening for GPCR expression in liver cancers, and found GPR107 was the most highly expressed GPCR in liver cancer and liver TICs. GPR107 was essential for the self-renewal of liver TICs. The expression of GPR107 was regulated by a long noncoding RNA lncGPR107. LncGPR107 was also highly expressed in liver cancers and liver TICs. LncGPR107 drove the self-renewal of liver TICs through GPR107. Moreover, lncGPR107 recruited SRCAP complex to GPR107 promoter to drive its transcriptional activation. LncGPR107 depletion inhibited the binding of SRCAP complex and GPR107 promoter and subsequent GPR107 expression. Moreover, LncGPR107-SRCAP-GPR107 can be targeted for liver TIC elimination. GPR107 was the most highly expressed GPCR in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncGPR107 participated in the transcriptional regulation of GPR107 in cis, through recruiting SRCAP remodeling complex to GPR107 promoter.

"Radiomics score: a potential prognostic imaging feature for postoperative survival of solitary HCC patients Radiomics is an emerging field in oncological research. In this study, we aimed at developing a radiomics score (rad-score) to estimate postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 319 solitary HCC patients (training cohort: n = 212; validation cohort: n = 107) were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from the artery phase of preoperatively acquired computed tomography (CT) in all patients. A rad-score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) logistic model. Kaplan-Meier and Cox’s hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of the rad-score. Final nomograms predicting recurrence and survival of solitary HCC patients were established based on the rad-score and clinicopathological factors. C-index and calibration statistics were used to assess the performance of nomograms. Six potential radiomics features were selected out of 110 texture features to formulate the rad-score. Low rad-score positively correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, like larger tumor size and vascular invasion. Meanwhile, low rad-score was significantly associated with increased recurrence and reduced survival. In addition, multivariate analysis identified the rad-score as an independent prognostic factor (recurrence: Hazard ratio (HR): 2.472, 95% confident interval (CI): 1.339–4.564, p = 0.004;survival: HR: 1.558, 95%CI: 1.022–2.375, p = 0.039). Notably, the nomogram integrating rad-score had a better prognostic performance as compared with traditional staging systems. These results were further confirmed in the validation cohort. The preoperative CT image based rad-score was an independent prognostic factor for the postoperative outcome of solitary HCC patients.

"Laparoscopically guided bipolar radiofrequency ablation of areas of porcine liver Background: Bipolar radiofrequency ablation (BRFA) is a promising technique with which to treat unresectable primary and metastatic liver tumors. Its effects on normal liver tissue and postoperative liver function, however, are unknown. We performed this study to determine (1) the feasibility of using laparoscopic ultrasound to guide placement of BRFA needle electrodes in the liver and (2) the histopathologic, hepatic biochemical, and systemic hemodynamic responses to BRFA.;  ; Methods: Two BRFA lesions were created in the liver of adult domestic pigs to ablate 8–10% of the normal liver volume. Laparoscopic ultrasound was used to guide creation of one peripheral liver lesion and one central liver lesion (with a major hepatic or portal venous vein branch in the center of the BRFA lesions) in each animal. BRFA of liver tissue was performed by passing 12 W of RF power for 16 min across two 16-gauge active-needle electrodes placed 3 cm apart.;  ; Results: All animals survived the procedure without significant hemodynamic alterations during or after BRFA. All animals had a transient elevation in serum transaminase levels that returned to normal within 1 week of the BRFA of liver tissue. Gross and microscopic histopathology of the BRFA lesions revealed 2.0–2.5-cm zones of complete coagulative necrosis around and between the BRFA needle tracks without destruction of major blood vessel walls.;  ; Conclusions: This study demonstrates (1) that laparoscopic ultrasound can be used to guide placement of BRFA needles in the liver and (2) that BRFA produces focal destruction of liver without significant systemic hemodynamic responses or alterations in liver function.

"Bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer via modulating HAT1 and increasing IL-9. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody of VEGF, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in HCC. In this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. Firstly, we performed RNA-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including VEGF, PI3K, HAT1, SLC7A11 and IL-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. We demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in liver cancer cells by driving VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/SLC7A11 axis. Clinical data confirmed that the expression levels of VEGF were positively associated with those of PI3K, HAT1 and SLC7A11 in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, we found that bevacizumab enhanced immune cell activity in tumor immune-microenvironment. We identified that HAT1 up-regulated miR-143 targeting IL-9 mRNA 3'UTR in liver cancer cells; bevacizumab treatment resulted in the increase of IL-9 levels and its secretion via VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/miR-143/IL-9 axis, which led to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo through increasing the release of IL-2 and Granzyme B from activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We conclude that in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune activity in liver cancer. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which bevacizumab synergistically modulates ferroptosis and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune activity in liver cancer.","bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances cd8+ t cell immune activity in liver cancer via modulating hat1 and increasing il-9. bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (ig) g1 antibody of vegf, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-pd1 immunotherapy in hcc. in this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. firstly, we performed rna-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line hepg2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including vegf, pi3k, hat1, slc7a11 and il-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. we demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in",bevacizumab induces ferroptosis enhances cd cell immune activity liver via modulate hat increase il bevacizumab recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin ig g antibody vegf inhibits angiogenesis growth hepatocellular carcinoma hcc ferroptosis new form regulated cell death function independently apoptotic machinery accept attractive target pharmacological intervention ferroptosis pathway enhance cell immune activity anti pd immunotherapy hcc investigate whether bevacizumab regulate ferroptosis immune activity liver firstly perform rna sequencing bevacizumab treat human liver cell line hepg cell find bevacizumab significantly alter expression number gene include vegf pi k hat slc il liver bevacizumab upregulated ferroptosis relate driver downregulated ferroptosis relate suppressor particular demonstrate bevacizumab trigger ferroptosis,b,Liver Cancer
"ADAR1-dependent miR-3144-3p editing simultaneously induces MSI2 expression and suppresses SLC38A4 expression in liver cancer. Aberrant adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR), has been implicated in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which microRNA (miRNA) editing contributes to cancer development are largely unknown. Our multistage hepatocellular carcinogenesis transcriptome data analyses, together with publicly available data, indicated that ADAR1 was the most profoundly dysregulated gene among RNA-editing enzyme family members in liver cancer. Targeted inactivation of ADAR1 inhibited the in vitro tumorigenesis of liver cancer cells. An integrative computational analyses of RNA-edited hotspots and the known editing frequency of miRNAs suggested that the miRNA miR-3144-3p was edited by ADAR1 during liver cancer progression. Specifically, ADAR1 promoted A-to-I editing of canonical miR-3144-3p to replace the adenosine at Position 3 in the seed region with a guanine (ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G)) in liver cancer cells. We then demonstrated that Musashi RNA-binding protein 2 (MSI2) was a specific target of miR-3144-3p and that MSI2 overexpression was due to excessive ADAR1-dependent over-editing of canonical miR-3144-3p in liver cancer. In addition, target prediction analyses and validation experiments identified solute carrier family 38 member 4 (SLC38A4) as a specific gene target of ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G). The ectopic expression of both ADAR1 and the ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G) mimic enhanced mitotic activities, and ADAR1 suppressed SLC38A4 expression in liver cancer cells. Treatments with mouse-specific ADAR1-, MSI2-siRNA-, or SLC38A4-expressing plasmids suppressed tumorigenesis and tumor growth in a mouse model of spontaneous liver cancer. Our findings suggest that the aberrant regulation of ADAR1 augments oncogenic MSI2 effects by excessively editing canonical miR-3144-3p and that the resultant ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G) simultaneously suppresses tumor suppressor SLC38A4 expression, contributing to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.","adar1-dependent mir-3144-3p editing simultaneously induces msi2 expression and suppresses slc38a4 expression in liver cancer. aberrant adenosine-to-inosine (a-to-i) rna editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded rna (adar), has been implicated in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which microrna (mirna) editing contributes to cancer development are largely unknown. our multistage hepatocellular carcinogenesis transcriptome data analyses, together with publicly available data, indicated that adar1 was the most profoundly dysregulated gene among rna-editing enzyme family members in liver cancer. targeted inactivation of adar1 inhibited the in vitro tumorigenesis of liver cancer cells. an integrative computational analyses of rna-edited hotspots and the known editing frequency of mirnas suggested that the mirna mir-3144-3p was edited by adar1 during liver cancer progression. specifically, adar1 promoted a-to-i editing of canonical mir-3144-3p to replace the adenosine at position 3 in the seed region with a guanine (ed_mir-3144-3p(3_a < g)) in liver cancer cells. we then demonstrated",adar dependent mir p edit simultaneously induces msi expression suppress slc expression liver aberrant adenosine inosine rna edit catalyze adenosine deaminase act double strand rna adar implicate various mechanism microrna mirna edit contributes development largely unknown multistage hepatocellular carcinogenesis transcriptome data analyse together publicly available data indicate adar profoundly dysregulated gene among rna edit enzyme family member liver target inactivation adar inhibit vitro tumorigenesis liver cell integrative computational rna edit hotspot know editing frequency mirnas suggest mirna mir p edit adar liver progression specifically adar promote editing canonical mir p replace adenosine position seed region guanine ed mir p g liver cell demonstrate,b,Liver Cancer

"Changes in the epidemiological trends of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region. Primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome and alcohol consumption, along with the existing burden of viral hepatitis, could significantly heighten the impact of primary liver cancer. However, the specific effects of these factors in the Asia-Pacific region, which comprises more than half of the global population, remain largely unexplored. This study aims to analyze the epidemiology of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region. We evaluated regional and national data from the Global Burden of Disease study spanning 2010 to 2019 to assess the age-standardized incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years associated with primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region. During the study period, there were an estimated 364,700 new cases of primary liver cancer and 324,100 deaths, accounting for 68 and 67% of the global totals, respectively. Upward trends were observed in the age-standardized incidence rates of primary liver cancer due to metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as an increase in primary liver cancer from Hepatitis B virus infection in the Western Pacific region. Notably, approximately 17% of new cases occurred in individuals aged 15-49 years. Despite an overall decline in the burden of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region over the past decade, increases in incidence were noted for several etiologies, including MASLD and ALD. However, viral hepatitis remains the leading cause, responsible for over 60% of the total burden. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the rising burden of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region.","changes in the epidemiological trends of primary liver cancer in the asia-pacific region. primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome and alcohol consumption, along with the existing burden of viral hepatitis, could significantly heighten the impact of primary liver cancer. however, the specific effects of these factors in the asia-pacific region, which comprises more than half of the global population, remain largely unexplored. this study aims to analyze the epidemiology of primary liver cancer in the asia-pacific region. we evaluated regional and national data from the global burden of disease study spanning 2010 to 2019 to assess the age-standardized incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years associated with primary liver cancer in the asia-pacific region. during the study period, there were an estimated 364,700 new cases of primary liver cancer and 324,100 deaths, accounting for 68 and 67% of the global",change epidemiological trend primary liver asia pacific region primary liver third leading cause relate mortality increase prevalence metabolic syndrome alcohol consumption along exist burden viral hepatitis could significantly heighten impact primary liver however specific effect factor asia pacific region comprise half global population remain largely unexplored analyze epidemiology primary liver asia pacific region evaluate regional national data global burden span assess age standardize incidence mortality disability adjust life year associate primary liver asia pacific region period estimate new primary liver death account global,b,Liver Cancer

"Iodized oil enhances the thermal effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound on ablating experimental liver cancer. The influence of the biological medium on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for ablating experimental liver cancer was studied. In study 1, the temperature rise in the focal zone in the presence of iodized oil or castor oil was observed in vitro. The results showed that HIFU with iodized oil produced a higher and faster temperature rise than did HIFU with castor oil, whether high-power (500 W/cm2) or relatively low-power (136 W/cm2) conditions were used (P=0.0008 and P=0.0004 respectively). With the excised liver samples, the temperature also rose higher and more rapidly after injection of iodized oil into the liver than when castor oil was injected (P=0.0239), and the target liver tissue revealed more radically and extensive destruction with iodized oil than with castor oil. In study 2, 48 nude mice, bearing primary liver cancer LTNM4 implanted subcutaneously, were randomly divided into four groups. Group I (n=12) were the controls, group II (n=12) were injected with iodized oil alone, group III (n=12) received HIFU treatement, and group IV (n=12) were exposed to HIFU after iodized oil injection.

"Clinicopathological significance of fibrotic capsule formation around liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Purpose: The fibrous capsule around hepatocellular carcinoma is well known to be an indicator of a good prognosis. However, the fibrotic stromal response in the liver to a metastatic tumor remains unclear. Patients and methods: In order to clarify the prevalence of fibrotic capsular formation around liver metastases as well as the prognostic and biological significance of the fibrotic capsule, 69 colorectal cancer patients, who underwent radical hepatectomy due to liver metastases, were investigated using immunohistochemical methods. Results: Encapsulated metastases as defined by a thick fibrotic band surrounding the entire surface of a metastasis were detected in 20% of the cases. The rate of initial recurrence in the remnant liver, which is a strong indicator for poor prognosis of colorectal liver metastasis, was significantly lower in the encapsulated metastasis group as compared with the non-encapsulated metastasis group. Proliferating fibroblastic cells in the capsule were myofibroblasts positively stained for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and they deposited dense extracellular matrices rich in collagen Type 1 in the layer of the inner half and secreted MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 in the layer of the outer half of the capsule. Activation of α-SMA positive hepatic stellate cells (HSC) was also observed in the liver parenchyma adjacent to metastases. Conclusions: The results indicate that fibrotic capsular formation is associated with a lower rate of initial local recurrence in the remnant liver, and that the capsule may serve as a mechanical and chemical barrier to local invasion by metastatic tumor cells. Proliferating stromal cells in the capsule are myofibroblasts, probably derived from HSC activated by colorectal liver metastasis in the liver parenchyma.","clinicopathological significance of fibrotic capsule formation around liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. purpose: the fibrous capsule around hepatocellular carcinoma is well known to be an indicator of a good prognosis. however, the fibrotic stromal response in the liver to a metastatic tumor remains unclear. patients and methods: in order to clarify the prevalence of fibrotic capsular formation around liver metastases as well as the prognostic and biological significance of the fibrotic capsule, 69 colorectal cancer patients, who underwent radical hepatectomy due to liver metastases, were investigated using immunohistochemical methods. results: encapsulated metastases as defined by a thick fibrotic band surrounding the entire surface of a metastasis were detected in 20% of the cases. the rate of initial recurrence in the remnant liver, which is a strong indicator for poor prognosis of colorectal liver metastasis, was significantly lower in the encapsulated metastasis group as compared with the non-encapsulated metastasis group. proliferating",clinicopathological significance fibrotic capsule formation around liver metastasis colorectal fibrous capsule around hepatocellular carcinoma well know indicator good prognosis however fibrotic stromal response liver metastatic remain unclear method order clarify prevalence fibrotic capsular formation around liver metastasis well prognostic biological significance fibrotic capsule colorectal underwent radical hepatectomy due liver metastasis investigate use immunohistochemical method result encapsulate metastasis define thick fibrotic band surround entire surface metastasis detect rate initial recurrence remnant liver strong indicator poor prognosis colorectal liver metastasis significantly low encapsulated metastasis group compare non encapsulate metastasis group proliferate,b,Liver Cancer
"Leiomyosarcoma of the sigmoid colon with multiple liver metastases and gastric cancer: a case report Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of the gastrointestinal tract is an extremely rare high-grade neoplasm with poor prognosis. For advanced LMS with distant metastasis, the decision as to the choice of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, including chemotherapy and surgery, is difficult. Here, we present an unusual case of LMS of the sigmoid colon with liver metastases and gastric cancer. The survival of this patient was prolonged by a combined modality therapy involving chemotherapy and surgery. A 66-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases was referred to our hospital. The initial treatment with docetaxel and S-1 considerably reduced both the gastric cancer and liver tumors; consequently we performed surgical resection. Pathological examination revealed that no viable tumor cells remained in the stomach and chemotherapy resulted in complete remission of the gastric cancer. The liver tumors were immunohistochemically diagnosed as LMS. A tumor of the sigmoid colon was subsequently discovered and the liver tumors were found to have recurred. The surgically resected sigmoid colon and liver tumors were all immunohistochemically diagnosed as LMS. These findings indicated that the multiple liver metastases arose from the LMS in the sigmoid colon, and that they were accompanied by advanced gastric cancer. We performed another surgical resection and administered chemotherapy to treat the recurring liver metastases. The patient survived for 4 years and 10 months after initial presentation at our hospital. Colonic LMS is rare and its joint occurrence with gastric cancer is extremely unusual. Although LMS is a high-grade neoplasm, a multimodal therapeutic approach can increase patient survival time even when multiple liver metastases are present.","leiomyosarcoma of the sigmoid colon with multiple liver metastases and gastric cancer: a case report leiomyosarcoma (lms) of the gastrointestinal tract is an extremely rare high-grade neoplasm with poor prognosis. for advanced lms with distant metastasis, the decision as to the choice of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, including chemotherapy and surgery, is difficult. here, we present an unusual case of lms of the sigmoid colon with liver metastases and gastric cancer. the survival of this patient was prolonged by a combined modality therapy involving chemotherapy and surgery. a 66-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases was referred to our hospital. the initial treatment with docetaxel and s-1 considerably reduced both the gastric cancer and liver tumors; consequently we performed surgical resection. pathological examination revealed that no viable tumor cells remained in the stomach and chemotherapy resulted in complete remission of the gastric",leiomyosarcoma sigmoid colon multiple liver metastasis gastric report leiomyosarcoma lm gastrointestinal tract extremely rare high grade neoplasm poor prognosis advanced lm distant metastasis decision choice appropriate therapeutic strategy include chemotherapy surgery difficult present unusual lm sigmoid colon liver metastasis gastric survival prolong combined modality therapy involve chemotherapy surgery year old woman diagnose advanced gastric multiple liver metastasis refer hospital initial docetaxel considerably reduce gastric liver consequently perform surgical resection pathological examination reveal viable cell remain stomach chemotherapy result complete remission gastric,b,Liver Cancer
"The effects and mechanisms of Xiaoyao San on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rat based on transcriptomics and proteomics analysis. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and is closely associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Despite its increasing prevalence and potential progression to severe liver conditions, there is currently no approved pharmaceutical intervention for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulations, such as Xiaoyao San (XYS), have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating NAFLD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of XYS in NAFLD. A rat model of NAFLD was established using a high-fat diet (HFD). The chemical constituents of XYS were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed to identify potential biological targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of XYS. The results were validated using ELISA and Western blotting. UPLC-MS/MS identified 225 prototype chemical components of XYS in the blood. XYS significantly reduced body weight, liver index, and Lee's index in NAFLD model rats. It ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, down-regulated serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, TG, TC, LDL-C, FBG, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and ROS, and up-regulated HDL-C levels. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed that XYS modulated key signaling pathways, including cAMP, TGF-β, NF-κB, and necroptosis. Specifically, XYS down-regulated the expressions of NF-κB, p-NF-κB, FOXO1, TGF-β1, RIP3, and p-MLKL, while up-regulating cAMP, PKA, p-PKA, and PPARα. XYS improves NAFLD by regulating the cAMP/PKA-mediated PPARα, FOXO1, and NF-κB signaling pathways. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of XYS in NAFLD and supports its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention for this condition.","the effects and mechanisms of xiaoyao san on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rat based on transcriptomics and proteomics analysis. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and is closely associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. despite its increasing prevalence and potential progression to severe liver conditions, there is currently no approved pharmaceutical intervention for nafld. traditional chinese medicine (tcm) formulations, such as xiaoyao san (xys), have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating nafld, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. this study employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of xys in nafld. a rat model of nafld was established using a high-fat diet (hfd). the chemical constituents of xys were analyzed using uplc-ms/ms. transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed to identify potential biological targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of xys. the results were validated",effect mechanism xiaoyao san nonalcoholic fatty liver rat base transcriptomics proteomics nonalcoholic fatty liver nafld characterize excessive lipid accumulation hepatocytes closely associate metabolic disturbance obesity dyslipidemia insulin resistance despite increase prevalence potential progression severe liver condition currently approved pharmaceutical intervention nafld traditional chinese medicine tcm formulation xiaoyao san xy show therapeutic efficacy treat nafld underlying mechanism remain unclear employ multi omics approach elucidate therapeutic mechanism xy nafld rat model nafld establish use high fat diet hfd chemical constituent xy analyze use uplc transcriptomics proteomics perform identify potential biological target signal pathway involve therapeutic effect xy result validated,b,Liver Cancer
"High intratumoral metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression predicts poor outcomes of cryoablation therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Cryoablation is one of the local therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its safety and effect has not been studied in patients with Child class A or B and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C HCC. Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis of HCC, but its predictive value to post-cryoablation outcomes remains unknown in patients with BCLC stage C HCC. This study assessed the safety and outcomes of cryoablation measured by time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS), and predictive value of MACC1 mRNA and protein overexpression in tumorous tissue to post-cryoablation outcomes in 120 advanced HCC patients with child-pugh class A or B by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. The potenial correlation of MACC1 and c-Met expression to tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis was also analyzed. The cryoablation in patients with advanced unresectable HCC resulted in a median TTP and OS of 5.5 (4.2- 6.7) months and 10.5 (9.0-12.0) months, respectively and no significant complications, comparable to the historical report for RFA therapy. The MACC1 mRNA and nuclear protein expression was significantly increased in tumorous tissues in these patients than that in normal liver tissue controls. Higher expression of MACC1 mRNA and nuclear protein in tumorous tissues in these patients was associated with shorter post cryoablation median TTP and OS than that with lower MACC1 expression.

"HER2 gene (ERBB2) amplification is a low-frequency driver with potential predictive value in gallbladder carcinoma. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is an aggressive type of cancer with a dismal prognosis. Recent case reports have highlighted the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a promising target for individualized therapy in biliary tract cancer; however, current data on HER2 positivity in GBC is contradictory. This study aimed to assess the proportion of HER2 positivity and its clinical implications in a large and well-characterized European GBC cohort. HER2 status was determined in 186 cases of surgically resected gallbladder adenocarcinoma and a subset of coexistent high-grade biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN, n = 74) in accordance with the up-to-date consensus for HER2 testing in gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry and dual-color chromogenic in situ hybridization. Positivity for HER2 was observed in 5.4% of all cases (n = 10). In those patients with concomitant high-grade BilIN, two of four positive samples also showed amplification in the precursor lesion, while in the two remaining cases, positivity was either confined to invasive tumor or high-grade BilIN, exclusively. Equivocal staining found in eleven cases was not accompanied by gene amplification. Staging of the HER2-positive group was significantly different from the HER2-negative group with most cases presenting at stage IV, paralleled by a trend towards decreased survival. One patient who received dual HER2 inhibition almost went into full clinical remission despite treatment initiation in a metastasized state. Our results reveal a low prevalence of HER2 positivity and highlight HER2 gene amplification as an early, potentially driving event in gallbladder carcinogenesis. Prospective standardized HER2 testing and randomized control studies are needed to prove clinical efficacy of targeted HER2 inhibition in GBC.","her2 gene (erbb2) amplification is a low-frequency driver with potential predictive value in gallbladder carcinoma. gallbladder carcinoma (gbc) is an aggressive type of cancer with a dismal prognosis. recent case reports have highlighted the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) as a promising target for individualized therapy in biliary tract cancer; however, current data on her2 positivity in gbc is contradictory. this study aimed to assess the proportion of her2 positivity and its clinical implications in a large and well-characterized european gbc cohort. her2 status was determined in 186 cases of surgically resected gallbladder adenocarcinoma and a subset of coexistent high-grade biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (bilin, n = 74) in accordance with the up-to-date consensus for her2 testing in gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry and dual-color chromogenic in situ hybridization. positivity for her2 was observed in 5.4% of all cases (n = 10). in those patients with concomitant high-grade bilin, two",gene erbb amplification low frequency driver potential predictive value gallbladder carcinoma gallbladder carcinoma gbc aggressive type dismal prognosis recent report highlight human epidermal growth factor receptor promising target individualized therapy biliary tract however current data positivity gbc contradictory assess proportion positivity implication large well characterized european gbc cohort status determine surgically resect gallbladder adenocarcinoma subset coexistent high grade biliary intraepithelial neoplasia bilin n accordance date consensus testing gastric immunohistochemistry dual color chromogenic situ hybridization positivity observe n concomitant high grade bilin two,b,Liver Cancer

"Somatic mutations and clonal dynamics in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. The most common causes of chronic liver disease are excess alcohol intake, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with the clinical spectrum ranging in severity from hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes1-7. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures8, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic liver disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic liver has a higher mutational burden than normal liver. Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1-5% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic liver disease; and others-arising from exogenous exposures-were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic liver, but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of liver tissue as it progresses from health to disease.","somatic mutations and clonal dynamics in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. the most common causes of chronic liver disease are excess alcohol intake, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with the clinical spectrum ranging in severity from hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). the genome of hcc exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes1-7. stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures8, which suggests that the complexity of hcc arises during the progression to chronic liver disease and subsequent malignant transformation. here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic liver has a higher mutational burden than normal liver. although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. driver mutations, such as point mutations",somatic mutation clonal dynamic healthy cirrhotic human liver common cause chronic liver excess alcohol intake viral hepatitis non alcoholic fatty liver spectrum range severity hepatic inflammation cirrhosis liver failure hepatocellular carcinoma hcc genome hcc exhibit diverse mutational signature result recurrent mutation across gene stem cell normal liver low mutational burden limited diversity signature suggest complexity hcc arises progression chronic liver subsequent malignant transformation sequence whole genome microdissections hepatocytes normal cirrhotic liver show cirrhotic liver high mutational burden normal liver although rare normal hepatocytes structural variant include chromothripsis prominent cirrhosis driver mutation point mutation,b,Liver Cancer
"Autophagy-dependent generation of Axin2+ cancer stem-like cells promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in liver cirrhosis. Autophagy is a pathophysiological phenomenon in liver cirrhosis that can further progress into hepatocarcinoma. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. To investigate the precise mechanism related to the origin of CSCs in liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, we labeled Axin2+ hepatic cells with EGFP in Axin2Cre;Rosa26EGFP transgenic rats, and then stratified clinical and rat liver cirrhosis samples by autophagy flux. Clinical follow-up and lineage tracing in transgenic rat liver cirrhosis revealed that while Axin2/EGFP+ hepatic cells were present in normal livers and cirrhotic livers without aberrant autophagy, hepatic Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells were generated exclusively in cirrhotic livers with aberrant autophagy and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. Aberrant autophagy in liver cirrhosis resulted in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, leading to activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in sorted hepatic Axin2/EGFP+ cells and their transition into Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells that possess CSC properties. In a transgenic rat liver cirrhosis model, induction or inhibition of autophagy in cirrhotic livers by systemic administration of rapamycin or chloroquine or transfection with Atg3- and Atg7-shRNAs significantly induced or suppressed HGF expression, which in turn increased or reduced generation of EGFP+CD90+ hepatic cells by activating or inactivating Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling, thereby promoting or preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. Systemic treatment with HGF-shRNA, SP600125 or stattic also reduced generation of EGFP(Axin2)+ hepatic cell-originated CD90+ CSCs in aberrant autophagic cirrhotic livers by inactivating HGF/Met/JNK or HGF/Met/STAT3 signaling, further preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. These data suggest that activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in Axin2+ hepatic cells via autophagy-dependent HGF expression and the resultant generation of Axin2+CD90+ CSCs is a major mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic livers.","autophagy-dependent generation of axin2+ cancer stem-like cells promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in liver cirrhosis. autophagy is a pathophysiological phenomenon in liver cirrhosis that can further progress into hepatocarcinoma. liver cancer stem cells (cscs) are believed to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. to investigate the precise mechanism related to the origin of cscs in liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, we labeled axin2+ hepatic cells with egfp in axin2cre;rosa26egfp transgenic rats, and then stratified clinical and rat liver cirrhosis samples by autophagy flux. clinical follow-up and lineage tracing in transgenic rat liver cirrhosis revealed that while axin2/egfp+ hepatic cells were present in normal livers and cirrhotic livers without aberrant autophagy, hepatic axin2/egfp+cd90+ cells were generated exclusively in cirrhotic livers with aberrant autophagy and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. aberrant autophagy in liver cirrhosis resulted in hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) expression, leading to activation of met/jnk and met/stat3 signaling in sorted hepatic axin2/egfp+ cells and their transition into axin2/egfp+cd90+ cells that possess",autophagy dependent generation axin stem like cell promotes hepatocarcinogenesis liver cirrhosis autophagy pathophysiological phenomenon liver cirrhosis progress hepatocarcinoma liver stem cell cscs believe initiate hepatocarcinogenesis investigate precise mechanism relate origin cscs liver cirrhosis hepatocarcinogenesis axin hepatic cell egfp axin cre rosa egfp transgenic rat stratify rat liver cirrhosis sample autophagy flux follow lineage tracing transgenic rat liver cirrhosis reveal axin egfp hepatic cell present normal liver cirrhotic liver without aberrant autophagy hepatic axin egfp cd cell generate exclusively cirrhotic liver aberrant autophagy promoted hepatocarcinogenesis aberrant autophagy liver cirrhosis result hepatocyte growth factor hgf expression lead activation meet jnk meet stat signal sort hepatic axin egfp cell transition axin egfp cd cell possess,b,Liver Cancer

"Imaging features of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare malignancy occurring in young patients without cirrhosis. Objectives of our study were to analyze contrast material uptake in hepatobiliary phase imaging (HBP) in gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI in patients with FLC and to characterize imaging features in sequence techniques other than HBP. In this retrospective study on histology-proven FLC, contrast material uptake in HBP was quantitatively assessed by calculating the corrected FLC enhancement index (CEI) using mean signal intensities of FLC and lumbar muscle on pre-contrast imaging and HBP, respectively. Moreover, enhancement patterns in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and relative signal intensities compared with background liver parenchyma were determined by two radiologists in consensus for HBP, diffusion-weighted imaging using high b-values (DWI), and T2 and T1 weighted pre-contrast imaging. In 6 of 13 patients with FLC gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI was available. The CEI suggested presence of HBP contrast material uptake in all FLCs. A mean CEI of 1.35 indicated FLC signal increase of 35% in HBP compared with pre-contrast imaging. All FLCs were hypointense in HBP compared with background liver parenchyma. Three of 6 FLCs had arterial hyperenhancement and venous wash-out. In DWI and T2 weighted imaging, 5 of 6 FLCs were hyperintense. In T1 weighted imaging, 5 of 6 FLCs were hypointense.

"A regression-based model for predicting the best mode of treatment for Egyptian liver cancer patients Liver cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Due to the extreme heterogeneity of this disease, its prognosis and management are still not yet standardized. Different treatment modalities are available. However, the patient’s response to each of them varies. Therefore, it is critical to establish a model to help physicians individualize the management of this aggressive tumor. This paper presents one of the first investigations into personalizing liver cancer treatment for patients with genotype 4 using their clinical and genetic data. In this study, we analyzed the data of 1427 Egyptian patients with liver cancer who were either treated by one of five different treatment methods or not treated. We proposed and compared between two pipelines, a Single-Model pipeline and a Multi-Model pipeline, for analyzing the patient’s clinical and genetic data to recommend the best liver cancer treatment and, therefore, potentially improve their prognosis. We studied the performance of six regression methods in predicting the outcome of the treatment modalities for liver cancer patients. The best performing method was used in building the models in the proposed pipelines. Our results show a difference in performance among different regression models, which proves the importance of choosing an appropriate one in decision-making, especially when dealing with important issues such as liver cancer treatment recommendations. In our analysis, we also prove the crucial importance of genetic data and their effect on patients’ prognosis and response to treatment. Finally, this study signifies the great potential that data-mining methods could have in improving healthcare especially for serious diseases such as liver cancer.","a regression-based model for predicting the best mode of treatment for egyptian liver cancer patients liver cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. due to the extreme heterogeneity of this disease, its prognosis and management are still not yet standardized. different treatment modalities are available. however, the patient’s response to each of them varies. therefore, it is critical to establish a model to help physicians individualize the management of this aggressive tumor. this paper presents one of the first investigations into personalizing liver cancer treatment for patients with genotype 4 using their clinical and genetic data. in this study, we analyzed the data of 1427 egyptian patients with liver cancer who were either treated by one of five different treatment methods or not treated. we proposed and compared between two pipelines, a single-model pipeline and a multi-model pipeline, for analyzing the patient’s clinical and genetic data",regression base model predict best mode egyptian liver liver one main cause relate death worldwide due extreme heterogeneity prognosis management still yet standardize different modality available however response varies therefore critical establish model help physician individualize management aggressive paper present one first investigation personalize liver genotype use genetic data analyze data egyptian liver either treat one five different method treat propose compare two pipeline single model pipeline multi model pipeline analyze genetic data,b,Liver Cancer

"Immunological distinctions between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common cause of chronic liver disease, ranges from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more aggressive form characterized by hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Increasing evidence suggests that NASH is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Recent studies support a strong mechanistic link between the NASH microenvironment and HCC development. The liver has a large capacity to remove circulating pathogens and gut-derived microbial compounds. Thus, the liver is a central player in immunoregulation. Altered immune responses are tightly associated with the development of NASH and HCC. The objective of this study was to differentiate the roles of specific immune cell subsets in NASH and HCC pathogenesis. Clarifying the role of specific cells in the immune system in the transition from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to liver cancer will help to understand disease progression and may open avenues towards new preventive and therapeutic strategies. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease. Growing evidence suggests that its most aggressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), can promote the development of liver cancer, the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Chang-Woo Lee and colleagues at Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea review the immunological distinction between NASH and liver cancer, focusing on the levels and activities of six key types of immune system cells. Chronic inflammation mediated by the immune system can create conditions for NAFLD, NASH and liver cancer to develop and worsen.","immunological distinctions between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld), the most common cause of chronic liver disease, ranges from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), which is a more aggressive form characterized by hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. increasing evidence suggests that nash is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), which is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. recent studies support a strong mechanistic link between the nash microenvironment and hcc development. the liver has a large capacity to remove circulating pathogens and gut-derived microbial compounds. thus, the liver is a central player in immunoregulation. altered immune responses are tightly associated with the development of nash and hcc. the objective of this study was to differentiate the roles of specific immune cell subsets in nash and hcc pathogenesis. clarifying the role of specific cells in",immunological distinction nonalcoholic steatohepatitis hepatocellular carcinoma nonalcoholic fatty liver nafld common cause chronic liver range simple hepatic steatosis nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash aggressive form characterize hepatocyte injury inflammation fibrosis increase evidence suggest nash risk factor hepatocellular carcinoma hcc fifth common worldwide second common cause relate death recent support strong mechanistic link nash microenvironment hcc development liver large capacity remove circulate pathogen gut derive microbial compound thus liver central player immunoregulation alter immune response tightly associate development nash hcc differentiate role specific immune cell subset nash hcc pathogenesis clarify role specific cell,b,Liver Cancer
"PDXliver: a database of liver cancer patient derived xenograft mouse models Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and characterized by heterogeneity and drug resistance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used in cancer research because they reproduce the characteristics of original tumors. However, the current studies of liver cancer PDX mice are scattered and the number of available PDX models are too small to represent the heterogeneity of liver cancer patients. To improve this situation and to complement available PDX models related resources, here we constructed a comprehensive database, PDXliver, to integrate and analyze liver cancer PDX models. Currently, PDXliver contains 116 PDX models from Chinese liver cancer patients, 51 of them were established by the in-house PDX platform and others were curated from the public literatures. These models are annotated with complete information, including clinical characteristics of patients, genome-wide expression profiles, germline variations, somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Analysis of expression subtypes and mutated genes show that PDXliver represents the diversity of human patients. Another feature of PDXliver is storing drug response data of PDX mice, which makes it possible to explore the association between molecular profiles and drug sensitivity. All data can be accessed via the Browse and Search pages. Additionally, two tools are provided to interactively visualize the omics data of selected PDXs or to compare two groups of PDXs. As far as we known, PDXliver is the first public database of liver cancer PDX models. We hope that this comprehensive resource will accelerate the utility of PDX models and facilitate liver cancer research.

"Adjuvant internal radiation therapy in a model of colorectal cancer-derived hepatic metastases Selective internal radiation therapy (SIR therapy) is a technique whereby metastatic liver cancer is irradiated by embolising microspheres containing the radionuclide yttrium-90 into the hepatic arterial circulation. To date this technique has not been used as an adjuvant therapy, but rather to treat established metastases in the liver. This study evaluated the use of two intrahepatic radiation doses delivered on radioactive microspheres for the treatment of small, growing micrometastases. Three groups of five rats were each inoculated with tumour spheroids into the portal vein. The resultant liver micrometastases were treated with either 10 or 20 MBq of yttrium-90 microspheres or a sham dose of non-radioactive microspheres injected into the portal vein 2 days following tumour inoculation. The livers of each animal were examined for the presence of metastases after a further 21 days and liver function tests were performed. At the time of sacrifice there was no obvious normal liver damage in any of the rats treated with microspheres. The livers of the sham-treated animals contained extensive signs of tumour deposition. A mean of 34 tumours were taken from the livers of each of the sham-treated animals, whereas only a single tumour was found in one animal treated with 10 MBq of yttrium and eight small tumours from two animals treated with 20 MBq. Liver function tests demonstrated a significant short-term increase in alkaline phosphatase levels in the radiation-treated animals compared with shams, but there were no other indications of any effects on liver function. These results indicate a potential role for SIR therapy in an adjuvant setting with colorectal cancer.","adjuvant internal radiation therapy in a model of colorectal cancer-derived hepatic metastases selective internal radiation therapy (sir therapy) is a technique whereby metastatic liver cancer is irradiated by embolising microspheres containing the radionuclide yttrium-90 into the hepatic arterial circulation. to date this technique has not been used as an adjuvant therapy, but rather to treat established metastases in the liver. this study evaluated the use of two intrahepatic radiation doses delivered on radioactive microspheres for the treatment of small, growing micrometastases. three groups of five rats were each inoculated with tumour spheroids into the portal vein. the resultant liver micrometastases were treated with either 10 or 20 mbq of yttrium-90 microspheres or a sham dose of non-radioactive microspheres injected into the portal vein 2 days following tumour inoculation. the livers of each animal were examined for the presence of metastases after a further 21 days and liver function tests were",adjuvant internal radiation therapy model colorectal derive hepatic metastasis selective internal radiation therapy sir therapy technique whereby metastatic liver irradiate embolising microspheres contain radionuclide yttrium hepatic arterial circulation date technique use adjuvant therapy rather treat establish metastasis liver evaluate use two intrahepatic radiation dos deliver radioactive microspheres small grow micrometastases three group five rat inoculate spheroid portal vein resultant liver micrometastases treat either mbq yttrium microspheres sham dose non radioactive microspheres inject portal vein day follow inoculation liver animal examine presence metastasis day liver function test,b,Liver Cancer
"Incidence and mortality of liver cancer in China in 2011 Liver cancer is a common cancer with poor prognosis in China. In this study, the national population-based cancer registration data were used to evaluate and analyze liver cancer incidence and mortality in China in 2011 and provide a reference for liver cancer prevention and control. We collected and evaluated the incidence and mortality data of liver cancer in 2011 from 177 cancer registries with qualified data. These data were used in the final analysis including calculating crude, standardized, and truncated incidences and mortalities, and estimated new liver cancer cases and deaths using age-specific rates and the corresponding populations. The national census in 2000 and Segi’s population were used for age-standardized rates. The estimates of new liver cancer cases and deaths were 355,595 and 322,416, respectively, in China in 2011. The crude incidence, age-standardized rate of incidence by Chinese standard population (ASRIC), and age-standardized rate of incidence by world standard population (ASRIW) of liver cancer were 26.39/100,000, 19.48/100,000, and 19.10/100,000, respectively; the crude mortality, age-standardized rate of mortality by Chinese standard population (ASRMC), and age-standardized rate of mortality by world standard population (ASRMW) of liver cancer were 23.93/100,000,17.48/100,000, and 17.17/100,000, respectively. The incidence and mortality were higher in rural areas than in urban areas and higher in males than in females. The age-specific incidence and mortality of liver cancer increased greatly with age, particularly after 30 years and peaked at 80–84 or 85+ years. Liver cancer is a common cancer in China, particularly for males and residents in rural areas.

"Differential motility stimulation but not growth stimulation or adhesion of metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells by target organ-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Liver is the most common distant metastatic site for colorectal cancers and when blood-borne colorectal cancer cells reach the liver, they first encounter hepatic capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells. Thus we studied differences between highly (HT-29LMM) and poorly (HT-29P) liver-metastatic sublines of human colorectal cancer cells by examining the interactions between tumor cells and liver microvessel endothelial cells. Using hepatic sinusoidal endothelial (HSE) and lung microvessel endothelial (MLE) cell-conditioned medium we measured the growth and motility stimulating activities released from these endothelial cells and adhesion of these cancer cells to the endothelial cells. Differences in the ability of HSE-conditioned medium (HSE-CM) or MLE-conditioned medium (MLE-CM) to stimulate HT-29 cell growth were not observed. There was a small but significant increase in the rate of adhesion of highly metastatic HT-29LMM cells to HSE cell monolayers than poorly metastatic HT-29P cells, but there was no difference in adhesion to MLE cell monolayers. HSE-CM stimulated the motility of highly metastatic colorectal cancer cells to a greater extent than the poorly metastatic cells. Motility-stimulating activity for the colorectal cancer cell lines was not detected in MLE-CM. The HSE-CM motility-stimulating activity for human HT-29 cells was not removed using antibodies against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF), complement component C3 or laminin, indicating that it is not related to these known liver-derived motility factors. The results suggest that the ability of highly metastatic HT-29LMM colorectal cancer cells to colonize the liver is related to their ability to respond to liver sinusoidal endothelial cell-derived motility factors and to a lesser degree to adhere to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.","differential motility stimulation but not growth stimulation or adhesion of metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells by target organ-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. liver is the most common distant metastatic site for colorectal cancers and when blood-borne colorectal cancer cells reach the liver, they first encounter hepatic capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells. thus we studied differences between highly (ht-29lmm) and poorly (ht-29p) liver-metastatic sublines of human colorectal cancer cells by examining the interactions between tumor cells and liver microvessel endothelial cells. using hepatic sinusoidal endothelial (hse) and lung microvessel endothelial (mle) cell-conditioned medium we measured the growth and motility stimulating activities released from these endothelial cells and adhesion of these cancer cells to the endothelial cells. differences in the ability of hse-conditioned medium (hse-cm) or mle-conditioned medium (mle-cm) to stimulate ht-29 cell growth were not observed. there was a small but significant increase in the rate of adhesion of highly metastatic",differential motility stimulation growth stimulation adhesion metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cell target organ derive liver sinusoidal endothelial cell liver common distant metastatic site colorectal blood borne colorectal cell reach liver first encounter hepatic capillary sinusoidal endothelial cell thus difference highly ht lmm poorly ht p liver metastatic sublines human colorectal cell examine interaction cell liver microvessel endothelial cell use hepatic sinusoidal endothelial hse lung microvessel endothelial mle cell condition medium measure growth motility stimulating activity release endothelial cell adhesion cell endothelial cell difference ability hse condition medium hse cm mle condition medium mle cm stimulate ht cell growth observe small significant increase rate adhesion highly metastatic,b,Liver Cancer

"Qualitative and quantitative variations in liver function thresholds among clinical trials in cancer: a need for harmonization. The liver is critically involved in drug metabolism pathways and the potential for hepatic toxicity is significant with specific cancer therapeutics. Variations in the definition of liver function thresholds that may generate heterogeneity of toxicity and efficacy outcomes across therapeutics trials in cancer require assessment. A random sample of therapeutic trials in cancer (n = 500, general category), trials using hepatotoxic drugs (abiraterone, pazopanib: n = 181), trials using drugs metabolized by the liver (doxorubicin, vincristine: n = 606), and therapeutic trials in hepatic dysfunction (n = 49) were each identified on clinicaltrials.gov. Definitions of liver function thresholds and their distribution were collated and categorized in each group. A third of all trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov across the four categories failed to provide an explicit definition of liver function. Among trials with an explicit definition, a combination of bilirubin and transaminase levels was used in 33–64%, whereas a miscellaneous combination of definitions (in the general category consisting of 11 unique liver function parameters creating 17 unique combinations) was used 29–58% of the time across the four categories of studies. The Child–Pugh or National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG) criteria were rarely employed (0–12% studies). Allowance for Gilbert’s disease in bilirubin thresholds was identified in only 6–23% studies and for liver metastases in 2–15% of studies. There is a marked heterogeneity in the liver function definitions used across cancer clinical trials even when the potential for drug toxicity and altered drug metabolism is significant. Harmonization of criteria will streamline eligibility and mitigate variations in key outcomes across trials.","qualitative and quantitative variations in liver function thresholds among clinical trials in cancer: a need for harmonization. the liver is critically involved in drug metabolism pathways and the potential for hepatic toxicity is significant with specific cancer therapeutics. variations in the definition of liver function thresholds that may generate heterogeneity of toxicity and efficacy outcomes across therapeutics trials in cancer require assessment. a random sample of therapeutic trials in cancer (n = 500, general category), trials using hepatotoxic drugs (abiraterone, pazopanib: n = 181), trials using drugs metabolized by the liver (doxorubicin, vincristine: n = 606), and therapeutic trials in hepatic dysfunction (n = 49) were each identified on clinicaltrials.gov. definitions of liver function thresholds and their distribution were collated and categorized in each group. a third of all trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov across the four categories failed to provide an explicit definition of liver function. among trials with an",qualitative quantitative variation liver function threshold among trial need harmonization liver critically involve drug metabolism pathway potential hepatic toxicity significant specific therapeutic variation definition liver function threshold may generate heterogeneity toxicity efficacy outcome across therapeutic trial require assessment random sample therapeutic trial n general category trial use hepatotoxic drug abiraterone pazopanib n trial use drug metabolize liver doxorubicin vincristine n therapeutic trial hepatic dysfunction n identify clinicaltrials gov definition liver function threshold distribution collate categorize group third trial list clinicaltrials gov across four category fail provide explicit definition liver function among trial,b,Liver Cancer
"Criteria for liver resection for metastasis from bile duct cancer The surgical indications for liver metastasis from bile duct cancer remain contentious, because surgery is generally thought unlikely to improve survival. However, recent reports show that long-term survival has been achieved with liver resection of metastasis from recurrent bile duct cancer in selected patients. Liver resection for liver metastasis from bile duct cancer was proposed only when the following criteria were met: liver-only metastasis, a solitary tumor, and no increase in the number of lesions during 3 months of observation. This study aimed to validate our criteria and to analyze which factors impact on survival. Between 2003 and 2017, 164 patients underwent pathologically curative resection for bile duct cancer. Recurrence developed in 98 of these patients, as liver-only metastasis in 25. Eleven of these 25 patients underwent liver resection (liver resection group), and 14 did not (non-liver resection group). The median overall survival was longer in the liver resection group than in all the patients (44 months vs. 17.8 months, respectively p = 0.040). The median overall survival was better in the liver resection group than in the non-liver resection group (44 months vs. 19.9 months, p = 0.012). The disease-free interval was also significantly longer in the liver resection group than in the non-liver resection group [22 months (range; 4–34 months) vs. 3 months (2–11), p < 0.001]. Potentially, metachronous solitary liver metastasis from bile duct cancer is an indication for liver resection when the patient has had a long disease-free interval. Observation for 3 months from first detection of metastasis may optimize the selection for this surgery.","criteria for liver resection for metastasis from bile duct cancer the surgical indications for liver metastasis from bile duct cancer remain contentious, because surgery is generally thought unlikely to improve survival. however, recent reports show that long-term survival has been achieved with liver resection of metastasis from recurrent bile duct cancer in selected patients. liver resection for liver metastasis from bile duct cancer was proposed only when the following criteria were met: liver-only metastasis, a solitary tumor, and no increase in the number of lesions during 3 months of observation. this study aimed to validate our criteria and to analyze which factors impact on survival. between 2003 and 2017, 164 patients underwent pathologically curative resection for bile duct cancer. recurrence developed in 98 of these patients, as liver-only metastasis in 25. eleven of these 25 patients underwent liver resection (liver resection group), and 14 did not (non-liver resection group). the",criterion liver resection metastasis bile duct surgical indication liver metastasis bile duct remain contentious surgery generally think unlikely improve survival however recent report show long term survival achieve liver resection metastasis recurrent bile duct select liver resection liver metastasis bile duct propose follow criterion meet liver metastasis solitary increase number lesion month observation validate criterion analyze factor impact survival underwent pathologically curative resection bile duct recurrence develop liver metastasis eleven undergo liver resection liver resection group non liver resection group,b,Liver Cancer

"Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. By use of the postcoded database held by the Small Area Health Statistic Unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain was examined from 1974-86 (England), 1974-84 (Wales) and 1975-87 (Scotland). Numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. Observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. The study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. Over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (P<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Among these cancers in the second stage, the excess from 0 to 1 km ranged from 37% for liver cancer (0.95) excess cases 10(-5) per year to 5% for colorectal cancer. There was evidence of residual confounding near the incinerators, which seems to be a likely explanation of the finding for all cancers, stomach and lung, and also to explain at least part of the excess of liver cancer. For this reason and because of a substantial level of misdiagnosis (mainly secondary tumours) found among registrations and death certificates for liver cancer, further investigation, including histological review of the cases, is to be done to help determine whether or not there is an increase in primary liver cancer in the vicinity of incinerators.","cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in great britain. by use of the postcoded database held by the small area health statistic unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in great britain was examined from 1974-86 (england), 1974-84 (wales) and 1975-87 (scotland). numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. the study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (p<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. among these cancers in the",incidence near municipal solid waste incinerator great britain use postcoded database hold small area health statistic unit incidence million people live near municipal solid waste incinerator great britain examine england wale scotland number observed compare expect number calculate national rate regionally adjust stratification deprivation index base census small area statistic observe expected ratio test decline risk distance km conduct two stage first involve stratified random sample incinerator second remain incinerator two stage statistically significant p decline risk distance incinerator combine stomach colorectal liver lung among,b,Liver Cancer

"Incidence, clinical risk and prognostic factors for liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer: a population-based retrospective study. Cervical cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in women, particularly metastasis resulting in a poor prognosis. However, the clinical characteristics of cervical cancer patients with advanced liver metastasis have not been well investigated. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical risk and prognostic factors for hepatic metastasis in cervical cancer patients. The clinical features of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) public cancer database between 2010 and 2015. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were performed to identify potential risk and prognostic factors for liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. A total of 431 patients (2.32%) developed liver metastasis in our analysis. The following characteristics were significantly associated with the development of liver metastasis: black ethnicity, uninsured status, higher tumor stage, poorer differentiated grade, non-squamous histology, non-surgery of primary site, patients with any additional lung, bone, and brain metastasis. Multivariate Cox regression showed that patients with additional lung metastasis, without radiotherapy, and without chemotherapy were negatively correlated with overall survival. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy was a favorable prognostic factor to improve overall survival, and chemotherapy showed to increase cause-specific survival. Additional lung metastasis was an independent characteristic for both risk and prognostic factors for hepatic metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. Our results found several potential clinical features that may be used to assess the risk and prognosis of liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. These associated factors may provide clinical indications for the early identification and treatment of cervical cancer patients with hepatic metastasis.","incidence, clinical risk and prognostic factors for liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer: a population-based retrospective study. cervical cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in women, particularly metastasis resulting in a poor prognosis. however, the clinical characteristics of cervical cancer patients with advanced liver metastasis have not been well investigated. we aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical risk and prognostic factors for hepatic metastasis in cervical cancer patients. the clinical features of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer were collected from the surveillance, epidemiology and end result (seer) public cancer database between 2010 and 2015. multivariate logistic and cox regression models were performed to identify potential risk and prognostic factors for liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. a total of 431 patients (2.32%) developed liver metastasis in our analysis. the following characteristics were significantly associated with the development of liver metastasis: black ethnicity, uninsured status, higher tumor",incidence risk prognostic factor liver metastasis cervical population base retrospective cervical one frequent malignancy woman particularly metastasis result poor prognosis however characteristic cervical advanced liver metastasis well investigate evaluate incidence risk prognostic factor hepatic metastasis cervical feature diagnose cervical collect surveillance epidemiology end result seer public database multivariate logistic cox regression model perform identify potential risk prognostic factor liver metastasis cervical total develop liver metastasis following characteristic significantly associate development liver metastasis black ethnicity uninsured status high,b,Liver Cancer
"Toripalimab combined with lenvatinib and GEMOX is a promising regimen as first-line treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 study. Advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a dismal prognosis. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m<sup>2</sup>) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) Q3W for six cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%. Further, 56.7% of patients experienced manageable grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), commonly neutropenia (40.0%) and leukocytopenia (23.3%). In conclusion, toripalimab plus lenvatinib and GEMOX are promising first-line regimens for the treatment of advanced ICC.

"Icaritin suppresses CAD-mediated liver cancer development by targeting miR-18b-5p in a xenograft mouse model. Cancer cells show abnormal nucleotide metabolism and prefer the de novo synthesis pathway. As the key enzymes, Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, Aspartate transcarbamoylase, and Dihydroorotase (CAD) is overactivated in cancer and promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis, supplying cancer cells with DNA and RNA biosynthesis precursors. Therefore, the development of drugs targeting CAD might inhibit cancer progression and transformation. Icaritin (ICT) is an isoprenoid flavonoid derivative with a wide range of anticancer activities, however, the mechanism of ICT in regulating pyrimidine biosynthesis in cancer remains unclear. MicroRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis by regulating the expression of target genes, and ICT has been shown to regulate the expression of miRNAs leading to suppressing cancer progression. Using both human normal hepatocytes and liver cancer cells, we found that CAD expression was significantly elevated in cancer cells. Interestingly, although ICT treatment reduced CAD protein levels in liver cancer cells, it increased CAD transcriptional activity. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed miR-18b-5p as a direct regulator of CAD. By transfecting miR-18b-5p mimics or inhibitors, we showed ICT upregulates miR-18b-5p to suppress CAD, inhibiting liver cancer cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Furthermore, in a human liver cancer xenograft mouse model, ICT treatment markedly reduced tumor growth and decreased Ki-67 expression, consistent with the in vitro results, CAD protein expression was downregulated, while its mRNA level was upregulated, further supporting a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Overall, ICT plays an anti-liver cancer role by increasing miR-18b-5p at the post-transcriptional level to inhibit CAD expression, which may interfere with the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine and development of liver cancer.","icaritin suppresses cad-mediated liver cancer development by targeting mir-18b-5p in a xenograft mouse model. cancer cells show abnormal nucleotide metabolism and prefer the de novo synthesis pathway. as the key enzymes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase (cad) is overactivated in cancer and promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis, supplying cancer cells with dna and rna biosynthesis precursors. therefore, the development of drugs targeting cad might inhibit cancer progression and transformation. icaritin (ict) is an isoprenoid flavonoid derivative with a wide range of anticancer activities, however, the mechanism of ict in regulating pyrimidine biosynthesis in cancer remains unclear. micrornas are involved in carcinogenesis by regulating the expression of target genes, and ict has been shown to regulate the expression of mirnas leading to suppressing cancer progression. using both human normal hepatocytes and liver cancer cells, we found that cad expression was significantly elevated in cancer cells. interestingly, although ict treatment",icaritin suppress cad mediate liver development target mir b p xenograft mouse model cell show abnormal nucleotide metabolism prefer de novo synthesis pathway key enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase aspartate transcarbamoylase dihydroorotase cad overactivated promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis supply cell dna rna biosynthesis precursor therefore development drug target cad might inhibit progression transformation icaritin ict isoprenoid flavonoid derivative wide range anticancer activity however mechanism ict regulate pyrimidine biosynthesis remain unclear micrornas involve carcinogenesis regulate expression target gene ict show regulate expression mirnas lead suppress progression use human normal hepatocytes liver cell find cad expression significantly elevate cell interestingly although ict,b,Liver Cancer

"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of 272 patients compared with 5,829 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma To clarify clinicopathologic differences between patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and identify potential factors influencing survival after hepatectomy for ICC. Comparison of clinicopathologic data was made between patients who underwent hepatectomy for ICC (n = 272) and HCC (n = 5,829) during the same period. Twenty-five clinicopathologic variables were selected for univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate their influence on prognosis of ICC. Compared with patients with HCC, ICC patients were more common in females and more elderly, had a lower proportion of asymptomatic tumors, lower serum alpha-fetoprotein, higher serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 and alkaline phosphatase levels; lower incidence of hepatitis history, associated cirrhosis and serum hepatitis B surface antigen; lower proportion of small tumors, well-encapsulated tumors and tumor emboli in the portal vein; higher proportion of single tumor, perihila lymph node involvement and poor differentiation; and less frequency of limited resection (all, P < 0.0001). Distant metastasis was less frequent in patients with ICC (P = 0.027). A total of 5-years overall and disease-free survival (in brackets) after resection was 26.4% (13.1%) and 44.5% (33.1%) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001) for patients with ICC and HCC, respectively.

"Circular RNA circMET drives immunosuppression and anti-PD1 therapy resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR-30-5p/snail/DPP4 axis Amplification of chromosome 7q21-7q31 is associated with tumor recurrence and multidrug resistance, and several genes in this region are powerful drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the key circular RNAs (circRNAs) in this region that regulate the initiation and development of HCC. We used qRT-PCR to assess the expression of 43 putative circRNAs in this chromosomal region in human HCC and matched nontumor tissues. In addition, we used cultured HCC cells to modify circRNA expression and assessed the effects in several cell-based assays as well as gene expression analyses via RNA-seq. Modified cells were implanted into immunocompetent mice to assess the effects on tumor development. We performed additional experiments to determine the mechanism of action of these effects. circMET (hsa_circ_0082002) was overexpressed in HCC tumors, and circMET expression was associated with survival and recurrence in HCC patients. By modifying the expression of circMET in HCC cells in vitro, we found that circMET overexpression promoted HCC development by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and enhancing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, circMET induced this microenvironment through the miR-30-5p/Snail/ dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4)/CXCL10 axis. In addition, the combination of the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin and anti-PD1 antibody improved antitumor immunity in immunocompetent mice. Clinically, HCC tissues from diabetic patients receiving sitagliptin showed higher CD8+ T cell infiltration than those from HCC patients with diabetes without sitagliptin treatment. circMET is an onco-circRNA that induces HCC development and immune tolerance via the Snail/DPP4/CXCL10 axis. Furthermore, sitagliptin may enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in a subgroup of patients with HCC.","circular rna circmet drives immunosuppression and anti-pd1 therapy resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the mir-30-5p/snail/dpp4 axis amplification of chromosome 7q21-7q31 is associated with tumor recurrence and multidrug resistance, and several genes in this region are powerful drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). we aimed to investigate the key circular rnas (circrnas) in this region that regulate the initiation and development of hcc. we used qrt-pcr to assess the expression of 43 putative circrnas in this chromosomal region in human hcc and matched nontumor tissues. in addition, we used cultured hcc cells to modify circrna expression and assessed the effects in several cell-based assays as well as gene expression analyses via rna-seq. modified cells were implanted into immunocompetent mice to assess the effects on tumor development. we performed additional experiments to determine the mechanism of action of these effects. circmet (hsa_circ_0082002) was overexpressed in hcc tumors, and circmet expression was associated with",circular rna circmet drive immunosuppression anti pd therapy resistance hepatocellular carcinoma via mir p snail dpp axis amplification chromosome q q associate recurrence multidrug resistance several gene region powerful driver hepatocellular carcinoma hcc investigate key circular rna circrnas region regulate initiation development hcc use qrt pcr assess expression putative circrnas chromosomal region human hcc match nontumor tissue addition use culture hcc cell modify circrna expression assess effect several cell base assay well gene expression analyse via rna seq modify cell implant immunocompetent mouse assess effect development perform additional experiment determine mechanism action effect circmet hsa circ overexpressed hcc circmet expression associate,b,Liver Cancer
"Prognosis of male lung cancer patients with urinary cancer: a study from a national population-based analysis. Lung cancer accounts for the most cancer-related deaths in the world. Our previous study suggested the improved survival of lung cancer patients, mainly female patients, with subsequent metachronous primary breast cancer. However, whether the survival advantages of the two primaries are associated with patients' sex and the specific breast cancer is unclear. Whether male lung cancer patients with another primary may encounter the same survival advantage as female patients is also uncertain. The uncertainty hinders these patients from the potential benefit of lung cancer clinical trial. A total of 343 male lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (LCBC), 1539 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (BCLC), 1181 lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma (LCPC), 7426 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior prostate adenocarcinoma (PCLC), and patients with single bladder/prostate/lung (SLC) cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. Patients were classified into simultaneous two primary cancer (sTPC), metachronous two primary cancer 1 (mTPC1), or mTPC2 groups when interval time between two cancers was within 6 months, between 7 and 60 months, or over 60 months, respectively. Propensity matching score program was executed to match the two primary cancers with single primary. Cox regression and competing risk regression were performed to identify confounders associated with all-cause and cancer-specific survival, respectively. The major cancer-related and non-cancer-related death in the two primaries were lung cancer and heart disease, respectively. Median overall survival times since lung primary of LCBC and SLC were 97 and 17 months, respectively, and incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death in LCBC since lung malignancy was significantly lower (Coef. - 1.24, 95% CI - 1.49 to 0.99; SHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). Among the categorized groups, prognosis values of sTPC and mTPC2 groups were not statically different from that of the matched single lung cancer, whereas increased overall survival time and decreased incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death relative to the matched patients were observed in mTPC1 group (H.R 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.41; SHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47). Similar prognosis of LCPC relative to SLC was also observed. Furthermore, a generally improved survival relative to SLC was observed in PCLC (median survival times of PCLC and SLC were 17 and 12 months, respectively; Coef. - 0.32, 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.22; SHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85), whereas prognosis of BCLC was similar to the matched ones. These results hinted that survival of lung cancer patients might vary with prior cancer history. Further analysis among groups with the two primaries suggested that advanced bladder cancer was not associated with prognosis of patients with LCBC and BCLC. On the contrary, advanced prostate cancer was associated with all-cause and cancer-specific death in patients with PCLC but not in patients with LCPC. Compared with patients with single lung cancer, male lung cancer patients with subsequent bladder/prostate primary over 6 months experienced generally improved survival. These results were similar to our previous study regarding female lung cancer patients with another breast primary. On the contrary, male lung cancer patients with prior primary malignancy encountered varied prognosis: improved survival relative to single lung primary was observed in lung cancer with prior prostate cancer, whereas prognosis of lung cancer with prior bladder cancer was not different. Therefore, great attention was required to characterize prognosis of lung cancer patients with another primary in advance, which was essential to eliminate the potential bias when these patients were included into the clinical trials.","prognosis of male lung cancer patients with urinary cancer: a study from a national population-based analysis. lung cancer accounts for the most cancer-related deaths in the world. our previous study suggested the improved survival of lung cancer patients, mainly female patients, with subsequent metachronous primary breast cancer. however, whether the survival advantages of the two primaries are associated with patients' sex and the specific breast cancer is unclear. whether male lung cancer patients with another primary may encounter the same survival advantage as female patients is also uncertain. the uncertainty hinders these patients from the potential benefit of lung cancer clinical trial. a total of 343 male lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (lcbc), 1539 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (bclc), 1181 lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma (lcpc), 7426 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior prostate adenocarcinoma (pclc), and patients",prognosis male lung urinary national population base lung account related death world previous suggest improved survival lung mainly female subsequent metachronous primary breast however whether survival advantage two primary associate sex specific breast unclear whether male lung another primary may encounter survival advantage female also uncertain uncertainty hinders potential benefit lung trial total male lung adenocarcinoma subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma lcbc lung adenocarcinoma prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma bclc lung adenocarcinoma subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma lcpc lung adenocarcinoma prior prostate adenocarcinoma pclc,c,Lung Cancer
"miR-21: a non-invasive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer? We read with great interest the article, published in Cell Biochem Biophys, showing that serum level of miR-21 was significantly elevated in lung cancer patients compared with controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that miR-21 could differentiate lung cancer from healthy controls with an AUC (the area under the curve) of 0.85, and the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 85.7 and 86.5 %, respectively [1]. These findings suggest that miR-21 can be a potential non-invasive biomarker for lung cancer patients and miR-21 may be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [2]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80–85 % of all cases of lung cancer [3]. Despite much advances in lung cancer therapy, the survival rate for lung cancer patients remains very poor [4]. Recent advances in functional genomics provide an increasingly comprehensive portrayal of lung tumorigenesis, but the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer remains poorly understood. These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of novel molecular mechanisms to guide treatment of lung cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that repress target gene expression by a combination of mRNA degradation and translation inhibition [5]. Recently, miR-21 expression was found to be higher in lung cancer serum samples than in control serum samples [3, 6–9]. High serum miR-21 was significantly correlated with tumor node metastases stage and lymph node metastasis of NSCLC patients [3, 5]. Overexpression of miR-21 showed a highly discriminative ROC curve profile, clearly distinguishing cancer patients from cancer-free subjects, and the detection of miR-21 expression yielded high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of lung cancer [7–9]. Furthermore, miR-21 expression was elevated in human lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H446 and NCI-H460) [2]. Human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2), one of the core mismatch repair genes, is affected in lung cancer development. Zhong et al. [2] found that hMSH2 was directly regulated by miR-21, and miR-21 expression was inversely correlated with hMSH2 expression in human lung cancer cell lines [2]. Notably, upregulation of miR-21 markedly promoted cell proliferation and revealed a higher proportion of cells at S phase. However, knockdown of miR-21 expression led to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and inhibited cell proliferation [2]. Similarly, tumor tissues showed an inverse correlation between high expression of miR-21 and low amounts of PTEN protein, where miR-21 suppresses PTEN by direct binding to the 30-UTR of PTEN [5]. Lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1703, and 801D) transfected with miR-21 inhibitor showed decreased endogenous miR-21 levels but significantly increased PTEN protein expression [5]. In addition, A549 and H1703 cells transfected with miR-21 inhibitor could restrain the growth of A549 and H1703 cells, and downregulation of miR-21 with miR-21 inhibitor in 801D cells could restrain its invasion ability [5]. Collectively, available evidence suggests that miR-21 may be a good biomarker for detection of lung cancer, and miR-21 may play an important role in lung cancer. However, further studies, especially in human systems, are needed to comprehensively explore the role of miR-21 in lung cancer, and miR-21 may be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. S.-C.

"Prevalence and causes of air pollution and lung cancer in Xuanwei City and Fuyuan County, Yunnan Province, China Xuanwei City and Fuyuan County of the Yunnan Province in south-west China are located in late Permian coal-accumulating areas. Both regions are rich in coal resources and have many coal mines. In the 1970s, epidemiologic studies demonstrated that lung cancer rates in Xuanwei were 4–5 times higher than the average in China [1,2]. The characteristics of these lung cancer incidences in the populations of Xuanwei and Fuyuan were described in previous studies. First, more women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan suffered from lung cancer, in comparison to other areas. The male-to-female ratio of lung cancer incidences in Xuanwei was 1.09∶1. However, almost all of these women did not smoke. In contrast, the male-to-female ratios of lung cancer incidences in China and the United States were 2.07∶1 and 1.8∶1, respectively [3]. Second, the major type of lung cancer in women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan was adenocarcinoma [4]. Third, the rural population suffered from lung cancer more than the urban population [3]. Previous studies demonstrated that indoor air pollution caused by burning “smoky coal” in non-vented indoor fire pits was the main reason for lung cancer in Xuanwei [5–7]. Burning “smoky coal” releases cancer-causing substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [8]. Animal experiments confirmed that the combustion products from burning “smoky coal” were more tumorigenic than those from wood and smokeless coal [9]. In the 1970s, the local government and the Science and Technology Department of the Yunnan Province encouraged and supported the residents of Xuanwei and Fuyuan to modify their fire pits into stoves with chimneys. In the late 1980s, the stove improvement project was completed, and the levels of indoor air pollution as well as lung cancer incidences subsequently decreased [10,11]. However, the indoor air pollution was not able to fully explain the current characteristics of lung cancer in Xuanwei and Fuyuan. The total morbidity and mortality rates from lung cancer did not decrease even after the region-wide household stove improvement. Both rates increased in some towns and villages after the first decade. From 2002 to 2005, the total mortality from lung cancer in Xuanwei was still very high, and the lung cancer rate was 3.3 times higher than elsewhere [12–15]. Therefore, the reason for the unabated high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei and Fuyuan must be determined. We hypothesize that despite the elimination of indoor air pollution, industrial developments heightened the outdoor air pollution level. Consequently, the lung cancer rate increased. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. First, in Xuanwei, coal production and other coal-using industries (e.g., coal coking and thermal power generation) are very important. These industries very rapidly developed. Indeed, coal production, coal coking, and thermal power generation increased more than 5, 10, and 10 times, respectively, over the past 30 years. Within the same period, the mortality rate from lung cancer also increased 4 times (Fig. 1) [12–15]. This direct correlation has prompted us to","prevalence and causes of air pollution and lung cancer in xuanwei city and fuyuan county, yunnan province, china xuanwei city and fuyuan county of the yunnan province in south-west china are located in late permian coal-accumulating areas. both regions are rich in coal resources and have many coal mines. in the 1970s, epidemiologic studies demonstrated that lung cancer rates in xuanwei were 4–5 times higher than the average in china [1,2]. the characteristics of these lung cancer incidences in the populations of xuanwei and fuyuan were described in previous studies. first, more women in xuanwei and fuyuan suffered from lung cancer, in comparison to other areas. the male-to-female ratio of lung cancer incidences in xuanwei was 1.09∶1. however, almost all of these women did not smoke. in contrast, the male-to-female ratios of lung cancer incidences in china and the united states were 2.07∶1 and 1.8∶1, respectively [3]. second, the major",prevalence cause air pollution lung xuanwei city fuyuan county yunnan province china xuanwei city fuyuan county yunnan province south west china locate late permian coal accumulate area region rich coal resource many coal mine epidemiologic demonstrate lung rate xuanwei time high average china characteristic lung incidence population xuanwei fuyuan describe previous first woman xuanwei fuyuan suffer lung comparison area male female ratio lung incidence xuanwei however almost woman smoke contrast male female ratio lung incidence china united state respectively second major,c,Lung Cancer
"Five-year lung cancer mortality risk analysis and topography in Xuan Wei: a spatiotemporal correlation analysis. In Xuan Wei, China, the lung cancer mortality rate is rising significantly more than that of the nation overall. However, it remains unclear 1) if improved diagnosis can just partially explain this observation and how other local risk factors may be correlated with the lung cancer mortality rate and 2) how the lung cancer mortality rates differ within Xuan Wei and how these spatiotemporal patterns are linked with local risk factors. To increase etiological knowledge, this study evaluated the spatial and temporal distributions of the health effects (the lung cancer mortality rates) from 2011 to 2015. Four steps of spatial analysis were applied, as follows: 1) hotspot analysis to determine the geographical patterns of lung cancer mortality, 2) spatially-weighted sum to identify areas with higher health risks, 3) bivariate statistical analysis to assess the overall correlation between coal mines and lung cancer mortality, and 4) geographically-weighted regression to test for correlations among different towns within Xuan Wei. Women had higher lung cancer mortality rates than those in men, with an increasing trend in both sexes over time. The incidence rates in Laibin Town were the highest in Xuan Wei every year. Over the 5-year study period, the lung cancer mortality was increasingly concentrated in Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang, where the smoky coal mines are most concentrated. The population-level health risks from the coal mine in Xuan Wei were mapped and divided into five types of risk areas (Type I – Type IV). Correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant correlation between lung cancer mortality as a whole and coal mine distribution during the 5-year study period. However, the geographically-weighted regression revealed a stronger correlation in medium (Type III) and second-lowest (Type IV) health risks. Xuan Wei lung cancer mortality has increased continuously since the third national retrospective surveys on the causes of death by the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China (2004–2005), especially for local women and residents over 35 years of age. Geographically, lung cancer in Xuan Wei showed unique spatiotemporal clustering. The local lung cancer mortality was significantly correlated with the smoky coal mine geographically. Some specific towns (Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang) within Xuan Wei manifested high correlations between lung cancer mortality and coal mines. The effects of coal mines on lung cancer mortality rates also spread geographically outward from these areas. Public health concern regarding lung cancer in Xuan Wei should prioritize higher-risk towns surrounded by smoking coal mines. Intervention strategies for particular toxic coal types require further studies on their chemical characteristics and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Additional studies are also warranted to systematically examine the local environmental health risks related to coal industries and combustion air pollution and eventually to conduct early screening of lung cancer for local people who are more exposed to smoky coal in high-risk areas.","five-year lung cancer mortality risk analysis and topography in xuan wei: a spatiotemporal correlation analysis. in xuan wei, china, the lung cancer mortality rate is rising significantly more than that of the nation overall. however, it remains unclear 1) if improved diagnosis can just partially explain this observation and how other local risk factors may be correlated with the lung cancer mortality rate and 2) how the lung cancer mortality rates differ within xuan wei and how these spatiotemporal patterns are linked with local risk factors. to increase etiological knowledge, this study evaluated the spatial and temporal distributions of the health effects (the lung cancer mortality rates) from 2011 to 2015. four steps of spatial analysis were applied, as follows: 1) hotspot analysis to determine the geographical patterns of lung cancer mortality, 2) spatially-weighted sum to identify areas with higher health risks, 3) bivariate statistical analysis to assess the overall",five year lung mortality risk topography xuan wei spatiotemporal correlation xuan wei china lung mortality rate rise significantly nation overall however remain unclear improve diagnosis partially explain observation local risk factor may correlate lung mortality rate lung mortality rate differ within xuan wei spatiotemporal pattern link local risk factor increase etiological knowledge evaluate spatial temporal distribution health effect lung mortality rate four step spatial apply follow hotspot determine geographical pattern lung mortality spatially weight sum identify area high health risk bivariate statistical assess overall,c,Lung Cancer

People younger than 50 years old, people who were smoking and quit smoking, people who had been drinking consistently, people with family history of cancer and PM2.5 exposure were proven to be a risk factor for lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer varied with sex, smoking status and air pollution. Consistent alcohol consumption, persistent smoking and smoking quit were risk factors for lung cancer in men. By smoking status, male was risk factor for lung cancer in never smokers. Consistent alcohol consumption added risk for lung cancer in never smokers. The combined effects of PM2.5 pollution exposure and ever smoking aggravated the incidence of lung cancer. According to air pollution, lung cancer risk factors are completely different in lightly and heavily polluted areas. In lightly polluted areas, a history of lung-related disease was a risk factor for lung cancer.

"Survival analysis of patients with primary breast duct carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma: a population-based study from SEER. The appeal to enroll patients with primary breast and lung cancer in clinical trials is increasing, but survival of these two primary cancers remains to be elucidated. This study analyzed the prognosis of primary breast duct carcinoma with subsequent lung adenocarcinoma (BCLA) and primary breast duct carcinoma with prior lung adenocarcinoma (LABC). Cohorts of 3,515 patients with BCLA and 654 patients with LABC were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were classified into simultaneous two primary cancer (sTPC), metachronous two primary cancer (mTPC1), or mTPC2 groups when the interval times between breast and lung cancer were within 6 months, between 7 and 60 months, or over 60 months, respectively. The propensity score matching program (PSM) was applied to determine the survival of BCLA/LABC relative to single breast/lung cancer. Cox proportional hazard regression model and competing risk modes were performed to identify confounders associated with all-cause and cancer-specific death, respectively. Survival of patients with LABC/BCLA relative to single breast/lung cancer was accessed via median survival time. The survival of patients with BCLA/LABC was generally poor compared with the survival of those with single breast cancer. The PSM-estimated HR in the sTPC group with BCLA and in the mTPC1 and mTPC2 groups with LABC were 0.75 (95% CI 0.62–0.90), 0.52 (95% CI 0.27–0.98), and 0.36 (95% CI 0.20–0.65), respectively, whereas the SHRs were 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.97), 0.68 (95% CI 0.34–1.34), and 0.46 (95% CI 0.27–0.80), respectively, compared with those in the single lung cancer group. By contrast, the survival rates of the remaining patients did not differ. The median survival times since secondary malignancy were 42, 23, and 20 months in the sTPC, mTPC1, and mTPC2 groups with BCLA, respectively, and 18, 60, and 180 months in those with LABC, respectively. For patients with BCLA, the adjusted Cox regression suggested incidences of all-cause deaths in mTPC1group were statically higher than those in sTPC group, whereas the incidences of all-cause and cancer-specific death in the mTPC1 and mTPC2 groups were statistically lower than those in the sTPC group. The prognosis of patients with breast cancer and subsequent lung cancer of over 18 months was not significantly different than that of single lung cancer, which supported the profound appeal to increase the involvement of these two primary cancers in potential beneficial clinical trials. For patients with lung cancer and prior breast cancer of within 6 months and subsequent breast cancer of over 18 months, prognosis was improved relative to single lung cancer.

"Gene-expression data integration to squamous cell lung cancer subtypes reveals drug sensitivity Background: Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCC) is the second most common type of lung cancer in the United States. Previous studies have used gene-expression data to classify SqCC samples into four subtypes, including the primitive, classical, secretory and basal subtypes. These subtypes have different survival outcomes, although it is unknown whether these molecular subtypes predict response to therapy. Methods: Here, we analysed RNAseq data of 178 SqCC tumour samples and characterised the features of the different SqCC subtypes to define signature genes and pathway alterations specific to each subtype. Further, we compared the gene-expression features of each molecular subtype to specific time points in models of airway development. We also classified SqCC-derived cell lines and their reported therapeutic vulnerabilities. Results: We found that the primitive subtype may come from a later stage of differentiation, whereas the basal subtype may be from an early time. Most SqCC cell lines responded to one of five anticancer drugs (Panobinostat, 17-AAG, Irinotecan, Topotecan and Paclitaxel), whereas the basal-type cell line EBC-1 was sensitive to three other drugs (PF2341066, AZD6244 and PD-0325901). Conclusion: Compared with the other three subtypes of cell lines, the secretory-type cell lines were significantly less sensitive to the five most effective drugs, possibly because of their low proliferation activity. We provide a bioinformatics framework to explore drug repurposing for cancer subtypes based on the available genomic profiles of tumour samples, normal cell types, cancer cell lines and data of drug sensitivity in cell lines. Lung cancer now accounts for 13% of new cancer cases and 29% of all cancer deaths each year in the United States. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, leading to an estimated 1.4 million deaths in 2010. Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multiple histological and molecular subtypes. Lung cancers are usually classified according to the histological types because the histopathological type of lung cancer correlates with tumour behaviour and prognosis (Beadsmoore and Screaton, 2003). The vast majority of lung cancer types are carcinoma malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. The two most common subtypes of lung cancer are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer types (SqCC). Squamous cell lung cancer is the second most common type of lung cancer, usually originating in the large airways in the central part of the lungs. Even for patients with SqCCs, outcomes are variable, suggesting that heterogeneity exists within this subtype. Further classification of SqCC into subtypes may help to understand the disease mechanism better, define the pathways relevant in disease origin and pathogenesis, and help guide treatment.","gene-expression data integration to squamous cell lung cancer subtypes reveals drug sensitivity background: squamous cell lung cancer (sqcc) is the second most common type of lung cancer in the united states. previous studies have used gene-expression data to classify sqcc samples into four subtypes, including the primitive, classical, secretory and basal subtypes. these subtypes have different survival outcomes, although it is unknown whether these molecular subtypes predict response to therapy. methods: here, we analysed rnaseq data of 178 sqcc tumour samples and characterised the features of the different sqcc subtypes to define signature genes and pathway alterations specific to each subtype. further, we compared the gene-expression features of each molecular subtype to specific time points in models of airway development. we also classified sqcc-derived cell lines and their reported therapeutic vulnerabilities. results: we found that the primitive subtype may come from a later stage of differentiation, whereas the basal subtype",gene expression data integration squamous cell lung subtypes reveals drug sensitivity squamous cell lung sqcc second common type lung united state previous use gene expression data classify sqcc sample four subtypes include primitive classical secretory basal subtypes subtypes different survival outcome although unknown whether molecular subtypes predict response therapy method analyse rnaseq data sqcc sample characterise feature different sqcc subtypes define signature gene pathway alteration specific subtype far compare gene expression feature molecular subtype specific time point model airway development also classify sqcc derive cell line report therapeutic vulnerability result find primitive subtype may come late stage differentiation whereas basal subtype,c,Lung Cancer
"Polymorphisms of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1 genotypes and lung cancer susceptibility in Mongolian Aim: To study the genotype of cytochrome P450 1A1(CYP1A1) I462V and glutathions S-transferase M1( GSTM1) and the relationship of the genetic polymorphism of them with the susceptibility of lung cancer in Mongolia of China. Methods: Allele-specific PCR and a multiplex PCR were employed to identify the genotypes of I462V of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 in a case-control study of 210 lung cancer patients with bronchoscopy diagnosis and 210 matched controls free of malignancy. The frequencies of the variant CYP1A1(Val/Val) genotypes and GSTM1(-) in lung cancer groups were higher than that in control groups (15.24% vs 7.4% and 56.67% vs 40.95% ). The individuals who carried with CYP1A1(Val/Val) or GSTM1(-) genotype had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer, the OR is 2.56 and 1.89 respectively. Stratified histologically the relative risk increased to 2.6 - fold when the patients carried with two valine alleles than the ones carried one valine allele in cases of SCC. GSTM1(-) genotype is the risk factor of SCC (OR=2.39) and AC(OR=2.16). The presence of at least one Val allele of CYP1A1 and GSTM1(-), the risk of lung cancer was increased, the OR was 4.15 for one Val allele and GSTM1(-) and 2.67 for two Val alleles and GSTM1 Considering ages and smoking status, the risk of lung cancer increased when the age less than 50 who carried with CYP1A1 valine (one or two) alleles or the age during the 51 to 65 who carried with GSTM1(-) genotype. The light smokers with CYP1A1 valine alleles and GSTM1(-) have a high risk for lung cancer. No association was found between the light and heavy drinkers with the susceptibility of lung cancer and the genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1(-). Conclusion: The valine allele of CYP1A1 was the risk factors of lung cancer especially for SCC and GSTM1(-) also was the risk factor of lung cancer and especially for SCC and AC of Mongolian, China. Light smoking has a influence each other with genotype of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1(-) and susceptibility of lung cancer. No relationship was found between the susceptibility of lung cancer and drinkers with genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1(-). The influence of genotypes on the susceptibility of lung cancer may depend on the ages. There may be a synergetic interaction between CYP1A1 valine allele and GSTM1(-) genotypes on the elevated susceptibility of lung cancer. So do those genotypes with light smokers.

We herein report that Sp1 negatively regulates metastasis and cancer stemness in E2-A549 and A549-T24 cells. Furthermore, E2 increases the mRNA and protein levels of RING finger protein 4 (RNF4), which is the E3-ligase of Sp1, and thereby decreases Sp1 levels by promoting Sp1 degradation. Sp1 can be recruited to the promoter of miR-3194-5p, and positively regulate its expression. Furthermore, there was a strong inverse correlation between Sp1 and CD44 levels in clinical lung cancer specimens. Sp1 inhibited CD44 expression by increasing the expression of miR-3194-5p, miR-218-5p, miR-193-5p, miR-182-5p and miR-135-5p, ultimately resulting in lung cancer malignancy.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Premenopausal women with lung cancer and decreased Sp1 levels have a poor prognosis.

"SII and lung cancer in middle-aged and elderly population: the nonlinear connection and the mediating role of ABSI. Background Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Early identification of high-risk populations is crucial for improving prognosis. The Systemic Inflammatory Index (SII), as an indicator that comprehensively reflects the body’s inflammatory status, has unclear potential mediating factors associated with lung cancer risk and differences among different age groups. This study aims to explore the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk and analyze the differences among different age groups. Method This study included 37,780 individuals (NHANES data). By comparing their demographic and health-related characteristics, the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk was analyzed. A weighted generalized linear model was used to analyze the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk, adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, race, age, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, and the poverty-income ratio (PIR). Subgroup analyses were further conducted to explore the differences in the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk among individuals above and below the age of 50. In addition, the non-linear relationship between SII and lung cancer risk was explored through restricted cubic spline plots and threshold effect analysis, and the mediating effect of the Abdominal Body Shape Index (ABSI) was analyzed. Result The study found significant differences in age, SII, and ABSI between the two groups. Even after adjusting for confounding factors, SII was positively correlated with lung cancer risk (OR = 1.0006, P = 0.004). Subgroup analysis showed a more significant association between SII and lung cancer risk in individuals over the age of 50 (OR = 1.0004, P = 0.006). Restricted cubic spline plots and threshold effect analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between SII and lung cancer risk, with a significant inflection point at an SII value of 1113.6364. Additionally, ABSI had a stronger mediating effect on the relationship between SII and lung cancer in individuals over the age of 50 (mediating effect: 14.13%), while no mediating effect was observed in individuals under the age of 50. Conclusion This study indicates that SII is positively correlated with lung cancer risk, with a more pronounced association in individuals over the age of 50. The mediating effect of ABSI on the relationship between SII and lung cancer is stronger in individuals over 50 years old, while no mediating effect is observed in those under 50. The non-linear relationship between SII and lung cancer risk suggests that in clinical practice, the level of SII and its changing trend should be considered comprehensively.

"Genomic analyses based on pulmonary adenocarcinoma in situ reveal early lung cancer signature Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents more than about 80% of the lung cancer. The early stages of NSCLC can be treated with complete resection with a good prognosis. However, most cases are detected at late stage of the disease. The average survival rate of the patients with invasive lung cancer is only about 4%. Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is an intermediate subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that exhibits early stage growth patterns but can develop into invasion. In this study, we used RNA-seq data from normal, AIS, and invasive lung cancer tissues to identify a gene module that represents the distinguishing characteristics of AIS as AIS-specific genes. Two differential expression analysis algorithms were employed to identify the AIS-specific genes. Then, the subset of the best performed AIS-specific genes for the early lung cancer prediction were selected by random forest. Finally, the performances of the early lung cancer prediction were assessed using random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) on four independent early lung cancer datasets including one tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs) dataset. Based on the differential expression analysis, 107 AIS-specific genes that consisted of 93 protein-coding genes and 14 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified. The significant functions associated with these genes include angiogenesis and ECM-receptor interaction, which are highly related to cancer development and contribute to the smoking-free lung cancers. Moreover, 12 of the AIS-specific lncRNAs are involved in lung cancer progression by potentially regulating the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. The feature selection by random forest identified 20 of the AIS-specific genes as early stage lung cancer signatures using the dataset obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma samples. Of the 20 signatures, two were lncRNAs, BLACAT1 and CTD-2527I21.15 which have been reported to be associated with bladder cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. In blind classification for three independent tissue sample datasets, these signature genes consistently yielded about 98% accuracy for distinguishing early stage lung cancer from normal cases. However, the prediction accuracy for the blood platelets samples was only 64.35% (sensitivity 78.1%, specificity 50.59%, and AUROC 0.747). The comparison of AIS with normal and invasive tumor revealed diseases-specific genes and offered new insights into the mechanism underlying AIS progression into an invasive tumor. These genes can also serve as the signatures for early diagnosis of lung cancer with high accuracy. The expression profile of gene signatures identified from tissue cancer samples yielded remarkable early cancer prediction for tissues samples, however, relatively lower accuracy for boold platelets samples.","genomic analyses based on pulmonary adenocarcinoma in situ reveal early lung cancer signature non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) represents more than about 80% of the lung cancer. the early stages of nsclc can be treated with complete resection with a good prognosis. however, most cases are detected at late stage of the disease. the average survival rate of the patients with invasive lung cancer is only about 4%. adenocarcinoma in situ (ais) is an intermediate subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that exhibits early stage growth patterns but can develop into invasion. in this study, we used rna-seq data from normal, ais, and invasive lung cancer tissues to identify a gene module that represents the distinguishing characteristics of ais as ais-specific genes. two differential expression analysis algorithms were employed to identify the ais-specific genes. then, the subset of the best performed ais-specific genes for the early lung cancer prediction were selected by",genomic base pulmonary adenocarcinoma situ reveal early lung signature non small cell lung nsclc represent lung early stage nsclc treat complete resection good prognosis however detect late stage average survival rate invasive lung adenocarcinoma situ ai intermediate subtype lung adenocarcinoma exhibit early stage growth pattern develop invasion use rna seq data normal ai invasive lung tissue identify gene module represent distinguish characteristic ai ai specific gene two differential expression algorithm employ identify ai specific gene subset best performed ai specific gene early lung prediction select,c,Lung Cancer

"Molecular profiling of mouse lung tumors: association with tumor progression, lung development, and human lung adenocarcinomas. We have performed oligonucleotide array analysis on various murine lung tissues [normal lungs, lung adenomas, and lung adenocarcinomas (ACs)] using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips to examine the complex genetic changes occurring during lung carcinogenesis. Analysis yielded 20 novel genes differentially expressed in both lung adenomas and ACs versus normal lungs, including the tumor suppressor APC2 and the oncogene Ros 1. In addition, 50 genes were found to be differentially expressed in lung adenomas versus lung ACs, including the differentiation factor Hox C6, the oncogene Ets 2, and the Ras nuclear transport factor, nuclear transport factor 2. To understand the potential relationship between genes expressed in murine lung tumors and its relationship to altered gene expression observed during embryogenesis and postnatal development, tissues from embryonic lungs and from lungs of mice up to 4 weeks following birth were examined using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips. From this analysis, approximately 1300 genes were determined to exhibit differential expression in fetal lung versus postnatal lung. When we compared lung adenomas, lung ACs, and normal lung parenchyma, 24 developmentally regulated genes were found aberrantly expressed in lung tumors; these included the cell cycle control factor CDC5, the cellular differentiation factor TEA domain 4, and the proapoptotic factor BNIP 2. Finally, we compared the murine lung tumor gene expression data to the expression of genes in human lung cancer, in order to assess the relevance of murine lung cancer models in the study of human AC formation. When the 17 human lung ACs and six human lung large cell carcinomas were examined, it was found that 13 of the 17 human lung ACs clustered tightly together in a pattern that was different from the remaining four human lung ACs and six large cell carcinomas, which exhibited a different pattern. Interestingly, the mouse lung adenomas appeared similar to 13 clustered ACs, while mouse lung ACs appeared more similar in pattern to the group consisting of four ACs and six large-cell carcinomas (LCCs). Nevertheless, when compared with the combined human ACs, 39 genes with similar expression changes in murine lung tumors and human ACs/LCCs were identified, such as the oncogene-related BCL7B, the cell cycle regulator CDK4, and the proapoptotic Endophilin B1. Overall, we have determined, for the first time, the expression profiles during murine lung tumor progression and have established, at the molecular level, an association between murine lung tumorigenesis and lung development.

"Progress in lung cancer: non-oat cell (non-small cell lung cancer). Lung cancer remains the greatest killing cancer in the United States with 149,000 new cases expected in 1987. The present expected mortality rate is 87 per cent. More women in the United States died of lung cancer than breast cancer in 1986. Asymptomatic, early and curable lung cancer in high risk individuals is usually found by routine chest X-ray. So-called Stage I lung cancer was reported to have a 83 per cent survival rate at three years by Martini and Beattie in 1977 and 70 per cent five year survival rate subsequently. When the more than 30,000 volunteer males were enrolled in the National Cancer Institute, national lung program for screening, 223 unsuspected lung cancers were found. 47 per cent were Stage I with a survival rate at five years of over 76 per cent. The PMI-Strang/Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center study found 53 cancers in its first screen and 235 lung cancers over the next eight years of the study. Forty per cent were Stage I with a five year survival rate of 70 per cent. Sputum cytology as compared to chest X-ray was of little additional value. Studies (Martini) of N1 lung cancer was found to have a 49 per cent survival rate following resection. The N2 group of lung cancers where the mediastinal tumor was surgically removable and followed by external radiation therapy had a 27 per cent survival rate at five years. Those tumors with solitary brain metastases where the solitary brain metastasis could be resected and the primary tumor controlled, gave a 27 per cent survival rate at six years. The group of advanced N2 disease where the mediastinum could not be completely cleared were a serious group of cancers. A study of 100 patients treated from 1977 to 1980 with surgery plus internal radiotherapy followed by external radiotherapy had an overall 22 per cent survival rate for four to eight years with most of the deaths occurring because of metastases outside the chest.

"An overview of mortality & predictors of small-cell and non-small cell lung cancer among Saudi patients. Lung cancer ranks as the top cancer worldwide in terms of incidence and constitutes a major health problem. About 90% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advance stage where treatment is not available. Despite evidence that lung cancer screening improves survival, guidelines for lung cancer screening are still a subject for debate. In Saudi Arabia, only 14% of lung cancers are diagnosed at early stage and researches on survival and its predictors are lacking. This overview analysis was conducted on predictors of lung cancer mortality according to the two major cancer types, small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in Saudi Arabia. A secondary data analysis was performed on small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) registered in the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) for the period 2009-2013 to estimate predictors of mortality for both lung cancer types. A total of 404 cases (197 SCLC and 207 NSCLC) were included in the analysis, all Saudi nationals. A total of 213 (52.75%) deaths occurred among lung cancer patients, 108 (54.82%) among SCLCs and 105 (50.72%) among NCSLCs. Three quarter of patients are diagnosis with advance stage for both SCLC & NSCLC. Univariate analysis revealed higher mean age at diagnosis in dead patients compared to alive patients for SCLCs (p=0.04); but not NSCLCs, a lower mortality for NSCLCs diagnosed in 2013 (p=0.025) and a significant difference in stage of tumor (p=0.006) and (p=0.035) for both SCLC and NSCLC respectively. In multiple logistic regression, stage of tumor was a strong predictor of mortality, where distant metastasis increased morality by 6-fold (OR=5.87, 95% CI: 2.01 - 17.19) in SCLC and by 3-fold (OR=3.29, 95% CI: 1.22 - 8.85) in NSCLC, compared to localized tumors. Those with NSCLC who were diagnosed in 2013 were less likely to die by 64% compared to NSCLC diagnosed in 2009 (OR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.93). Age, sex, topography and laterality were not associated with mortality for both types of lung cancer. We observed that the stage of the tumor is the strongest predictor of mortality for both SCLCs and NSCLs. This confirms the impact of diagnostic stage on survival. However, establishing Saudi-specific lung cancer screening guidelines will require further research on the benefits and harms of screening modalities in the Saudi population.","an overview of mortality & predictors of small-cell and non-small cell lung cancer among saudi patients. lung cancer ranks as the top cancer worldwide in terms of incidence and constitutes a major health problem. about 90% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advance stage where treatment is not available. despite evidence that lung cancer screening improves survival, guidelines for lung cancer screening are still a subject for debate. in saudi arabia, only 14% of lung cancers are diagnosed at early stage and researches on survival and its predictors are lacking. this overview analysis was conducted on predictors of lung cancer mortality according to the two major cancer types, small-cell lung cancers (sclcs) and non-small cell lung cancers (nsclcs) in saudi arabia. a secondary data analysis was performed on small-cell lung cancers (sclcs) and non-small cell lung cancers (nsclcs) registered in the saudi cancer registry (scr) for the period 2009-2013",overview mortality predictor small cell non small cell lung among saudi lung rank top worldwide term incidence constitute major health problem lung diagnose advance stage available despite evidence lung screen improves survival guideline lung screening still subject debate saudi arabia lung diagnose early stage research survival predictor lack overview conduct predictor lung mortality accord two major type small cell lung sclcs non small cell lung nsclcs saudi arabia secondary data perform small cell lung sclcs non small cell lung nsclcs register saudi registry scr period,c,Lung Cancer
"The relationship between physical activity, obesity, and lung cancer risk by smoking status in a large prospective cohort of US adults. Physical activity has been associated with lower lung cancer risk in numerous studies with estimates ranging from 20 to 50% lower risk in the most versus the least active study participants. Underweight and obesity have also been associated with lower lung cancer risk, with a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship. However, associations of physical activity and obesity with lung cancer are likely significantly confounded by smoking since individuals who smoke are generally less active and leaner than non-smokers, but few studies have examined these associations stratified by smoking status. Using data from 162,679 men and women who were cancer-free at enrollment (1992–1993) in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, we examined associations of baseline recreational physical activity (MET-hours per week; none, 0.1 to <8.75 (reference), 8.75–17.4, 17.5+ MET-hours/week), baseline body mass index (BMI, weight (kg)/height (m2); <18.5, 18.5–22.0 (reference), 22.1–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0+ kg/m2), and waist circumference (measured in 1997; sex-specific quartiles) in relation to lung cancer risk stratified by smoking status and years since quitting among former smokers (never, current, former <10 years, former, 10–19 years, former 20+ years). Cox proportional hazards modeling computed hazard rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) while adjusting for potential confounders. During 2,384,546 person years of follow-up time, 4,669 men and women were diagnosed with lung cancer (453 among never smokers; 1,452 among current smokers; 1,194 among former smokers <10 years since quitting; 725 among former 10–19 years; and 845 among former 20+ years). Physical activity was not associated with lung cancer risk within any of the smoking strata except in former smokers less than 10 years since quitting (RR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.67–0.90 for 17.5+ MET-hours/week). Similarly, BMI was inversely associated with lung cancer in former smokers less than 10 years since quitting (RR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.55–0.84 for 30+ kg/m2) and more modestly in former smokers who quit 10–19 and 20+ years ago. Waist circumference was not associated with lung cancer risk in any smoking category. While being physically active and maintaining a healthy body weight are important for prevention of various chronic diseases, including several types of cancer, our results suggest that physical activity, BMI, and waist circumference are not associated with lung cancer risk, regardless of smoking status.","the relationship between physical activity, obesity, and lung cancer risk by smoking status in a large prospective cohort of us adults. physical activity has been associated with lower lung cancer risk in numerous studies with estimates ranging from 20 to 50% lower risk in the most versus the least active study participants. underweight and obesity have also been associated with lower lung cancer risk, with a nonlinear, inverted u-shaped relationship. however, associations of physical activity and obesity with lung cancer are likely significantly confounded by smoking since individuals who smoke are generally less active and leaner than non-smokers, but few studies have examined these associations stratified by smoking status. using data from 162,679 men and women who were cancer-free at enrollment (1992–1993) in the american cancer society cancer prevention study-ii nutrition cohort, we examined associations of baseline recreational physical activity (met-hours per week; none, 0.1 to <8.75 (reference), 8.75–17.4, 17.5+",relationship physical activity obesity lung risk smoke status large prospective cohort u adults physical activity associate low lung risk numerous estimate range low risk versus least active participant underweight obesity also associate low lung risk nonlinear inverted u shape relationship however association physical activity obesity lung likely significantly confound smoke since individual smoke generally less active lean non smoker examine association stratify smoke status use data men woman free enrollment american society prevention ii nutrition cohort examine association baseline recreational physical activity meet hour per week none reference,c,Lung Cancer
"Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer in Canada and their costs Escalating health care costs have made it imperative to evaluate the resources required to diagnose and treat major illnesses in Canadians. For Canadian men, lung cancer is not only the most common malignancy, but also the major cancer killer. As of 1994, lung cancer is expected to overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. This paper presents a detailed description of the methodology used to determine the direct health care costs associated with 'standard' diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for lung cancer in Canada in 1988. Clinical algorithms were developed for each stage of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The algorithms were designed to take the form of decision trees for each clinical stage of lung cancer. The proportion of patients assigned to each branch was based upon questionnaire responses obtained from thoracic surgeons and radiation oncologists when presented with clinical scenarios, and information from provincial cancer registries. Direct care costs were derived primarily from one provincial fee schedule (Ontario), and costing information obtained during the conduct of several Canadian clinical trials in lung cancer. Direct costs for diagnosis and initial treatment of NSCLC (excluding relapse and terminal care costs) ranged from $17,889 for the surgery/post-operative radiotherapy arm of stages I and II to $6,333 for the supportive care arm (stage IV). The cost of determining relapse for NSCLC was estimated to be $1,528, and terminal care costs, which included palliative radiotherapy and hospitalisation, were $10,331. Direct costs for diagnosis and initial treatment of SCLC ranged from $18,691 for limited stage disease to $4,739 for the supportive care arm of extensive disease. The cost of diagnosing relapse for SCLC was estimated to be $1,590, and terminal care costs averaged $9,966. This report provides an estimate of the Canadian costs of managing lung cancer by stage and treatment modality. Because the actual costs of all components of care are not available from any combination of sources, these cost estimates must be viewed as an idealised estimate of the cost of lung cancer management. However, we believe that the lung cancer costing model that we have developed provides a level of sophistication which gives a reasonable estimate of the cost per case of treating NSCLC and SCLC.","diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer in canada and their costs escalating health care costs have made it imperative to evaluate the resources required to diagnose and treat major illnesses in canadians. for canadian men, lung cancer is not only the most common malignancy, but also the major cancer killer. as of 1994, lung cancer is expected to overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. this paper presents a detailed description of the methodology used to determine the direct health care costs associated with 'standard' diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for lung cancer in canada in 1988. clinical algorithms were developed for each stage of non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) and small-cell lung cancer (sclc). the algorithms were designed to take the form of decision trees for each clinical stage of lung cancer. the proportion of patients assigned to each branch was based upon questionnaire responses",diagnostic therapeutic approach lung canada cost escalate health care cost make imperative evaluate resource require diagnose treat major illness canadian canadian men lung common malignancy also major killer lung expect overtake breast lead cause death woman paper present detailed description methodology use determine direct health care cost associate standard diagnostic therapeutic approach lung canada algorithm develop stage non small cell lung nsclc small cell lung sclc algorithm design take form decision tree stage lung proportion assign branch base upon questionnaire response,c,Lung Cancer
"A phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis reveals the genetical associations of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer. Lung cancer is a complex disease with varying subtypes. The genetic architectures and risk factors that are similar or distinct among these subtypes remain unclear. In this work, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by the International Lung Cancer Consortium and transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung were utilized to illustrate the genetic landscapes of different subtypes of lung cancer. GWAS of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank and 902 phenotypes from FinnGen Biobank were analyzed to identify the genetic risk factors specific or common to each subtype of lung cancer through two sample Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighting method. Multivariable Mendelian randomization was employed to assess the true causals of lung cancer. We found that lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma shared similar, yet varied genetic architectures. Genetic risk loci at 15q25 were identified in all types of lung cancer. Yet, genetic risk loci at 5p15 were observed in squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, but not in small cell lung carcinoma. Out of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank, smoking, time spent watching television, age first had sexual intercourse, alcohol usually taken with meal and age at first live birth were common risk factors for all types of lung cancer. Moreover, out of 902 traits in FinnGen Biobank, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was positively associated with small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. Angina pectoris and myocardial infarction were negatively associated with lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. And Alzheimer's disease was negatively associated with lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer. In further weighted median and weighted mode methods, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease also had genetical associations with lung cancer or its subtypes. Even, considering factors such as smoking, COPD, and other risk factors together, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease retained the genetical associations with lung cancer and its subtypes. Overall, in a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis, our results have highlighted both similar and distinct risk factors among different subtypes of lung cancer. Additionally, our findings have provided genetic associations linking myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer or its various subtypes.","a phenome-wide mendelian randomization analysis reveals the genetical associations of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and alzheimer's disease with lung cancer. lung cancer is a complex disease with varying subtypes. the genetic architectures and risk factors that are similar or distinct among these subtypes remain unclear. in this work, genome-wide association studies (gwas) conducted by the international lung cancer consortium and transdisciplinary research in cancer of the lung were utilized to illustrate the genetic landscapes of different subtypes of lung cancer. gwas of 942 phenotypes from uk biobank and 902 phenotypes from finngen biobank were analyzed to identify the genetic risk factors specific or common to each subtype of lung cancer through two sample mendelian randomization inverse variance weighting method. multivariable mendelian randomization was employed to assess the true causals of lung cancer. we found that lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma shared similar,",phenome wide mendelian randomization reveal genetical association myocardial infarction angina pectoris alzheimer lung lung complex vary subtypes genetic architecture risk factor similar distinct among subtypes remain unclear work genome wide association gwas conduct international lung consortium transdisciplinary research lung utilize illustrate genetic landscape different subtypes lung gwas phenotype uk biobank phenotype finngen biobank analyze identify genetic risk factor specific common subtype lung two sample mendelian randomization inverse variance weight method multivariable mendelian randomization employ assess true causals lung find lung small cell lung carcinoma squamous cell lung lung adenocarcinoma share similar,c,Lung Cancer

"Combined effects of lung disease history, environmental exposures, and family history of lung cancer to susceptibility of lung cancer in Chinese non-smokers Although cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, the incidence rate of lung cancer among non-smokers is notable. The etiology and potential mechanism of non-smoker lung cancer are worthy of further research. This study was designed to explore the collective effects of environmental factors and the relationship between environmental exposure index (EEI) and lung cancer among non-smokers by evaluating the joint effects among lung disease history, environmental factors, and family history of lung cancer without smoking confounders. A total of 767 never-smoked lung cancer cases and 767 sex- and age-matched controls were selected from the department of Thoracic Surgery and Respiratory Medicine of three hospitals in Fujian, China. We used two methods to develop the EEI according to 12 statistically significant environmental risk factors. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was applied to analyze the non-linear relationship between EEI and lung cancer in non-smokers. Combined effects, additive interaction, and multiplicative interaction were assessed among lung disease history, EEI, and family history of lung cancer to estimate susceptibility to develop lung cancer. Lung disease history, especially asthma, was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer with an odds ratio (OR) for asthma history of 14.720 (95% CI: 1.877–115.449). Family history of lung cancer was related to susceptibility of lung cancer (OR = 3.347, 95% CI: 1.930–5.806). According to type of relatives and cancer, a parental or children’s history and a sibling’s history of lung cancer were significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. The positive association between EEI and lung cancer was apparently stronger in those with lung disease history or family lung cancer history. Furthermore, there was a addictive interaction between EEI and lung disease history, and a possibly addictive interaction between EEI and family lung cancer history on development of lung cancer. There were combined effects among lung disease history, environmental exposures, and family history of lung cancer toward susceptibility to lung cancer in Chinese non-smokers. Non-smokers who had a family history of lung cancer were at higher risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who had lung disease history. Non-smokers with family cancer history may obtain benefits from removal of environmental exposures and active treatment of lung disease.","combined effects of lung disease history, environmental exposures, and family history of lung cancer to susceptibility of lung cancer in chinese non-smokers although cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, the incidence rate of lung cancer among non-smokers is notable. the etiology and potential mechanism of non-smoker lung cancer are worthy of further research. this study was designed to explore the collective effects of environmental factors and the relationship between environmental exposure index (eei) and lung cancer among non-smokers by evaluating the joint effects among lung disease history, environmental factors, and family history of lung cancer without smoking confounders. a total of 767 never-smoked lung cancer cases and 767 sex- and age-matched controls were selected from the department of thoracic surgery and respiratory medicine of three hospitals in fujian, china. we used two methods to develop the eei according to 12 statistically significant environmental risk factors. restricted",combined effect lung history environmental exposure family history lung susceptibility lung chinese non smoker although cigarette smoking major risk factor lung incidence rate lung among non smoker notable etiology potential mechanism non smoker lung worthy research design explore collective effect environmental factor relationship environmental exposure index eei lung among non smoker evaluate joint effect among lung history environmental factor family history lung without smoke confounders total never smoke lung sex age match control select department thoracic surgery respiratory medicine three hospital fujian china use two method develop eei accord statistically significant environmental risk factor restrict,c,Lung Cancer

"YangZheng XiaoJi exerts anti-tumour growth effects by antagonising the effects of HGF and its receptor, cMET, in human lung cancer cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ; is a cytokine that has a profound effect on cancer cells by stimulating migration and invasion and acting as an angiogenic factor. In lung cancer, the factor also plays a pivotal role and is linked to a poor outcome in patients. In particular, HGF is known to work in combination with EGF on lung cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a traditional Chinese medicine reported in cancer therapies, namely YangZheng XiaoJi (YZXJ) on lung cancer and on HGF mediated migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Human lung cancer cells, SKMES1 and A549 were used in the study. An extract from the medicine was used. Cell migration was investigated using the EVOS and by ECIS. Cell–matrix adhesion and in vitro invasion were assessed. In vivo growth of lung cancer was tested using an in vivo xenograft tumour model and activation of the HGF receptor in lung tumours by an immunofluorescence method. Both lung cancer cells increased their migration in response to HGF and responded to YZXJ by reducing their speed of migration. YZXJ markedly reduced the migration and in vitro invasiveness induced by HGF. It worked synergistically with PHA665752 and SU11274, HGF receptor inhibitors on the lung cancer cells both on HGF receptor activation and on cell functions. A combination of HGF and EGF resulted in a greater increase in cell migration, which was similarly inhibited by YZXJ, and in combination with the HGF receptor and EGF receptor inhibitors. In vivo, YZXJ reduced the rate of tumour growth and potentiated the effects of PHA665752 on tumour growth. It was further revealed that YZXJ significantly reduced the degree of phosphorylation of the HGF receptor in lung tumours. YZXJ has a significant role in reducing the migration, invasion and in vivo tumour growth of lung cancer and acts to inhibit the migratory and invasive effects induced by HGF and indeed by HGF/EGF. This effect is likely attributed to the inhibition of the HGF receptor activation. These results indicate that YZXJ has a therapeutic role in lung cancer and that combined strategy with methods to block HGF and EGF should be considered.","yangzheng xiaoji exerts anti-tumour growth effects by antagonising the effects of hgf and its receptor, cmet, in human lung cancer cells. hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) ; is a cytokine that has a profound effect on cancer cells by stimulating migration and invasion and acting as an angiogenic factor. in lung cancer, the factor also plays a pivotal role and is linked to a poor outcome in patients. in particular, hgf is known to work in combination with egf on lung cancer cells. in the present study, we investigated the effect of a traditional chinese medicine reported in cancer therapies, namely yangzheng xiaoji (yzxj) on lung cancer and on hgf mediated migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. human lung cancer cells, skmes1 and a549 were used in the study. an extract from the medicine was used. cell migration was investigated using the evos and by ecis. cell–matrix adhesion and in",yangzheng xiaoji exert anti growth effect antagonise effect hgf receptor cmet human lung cell hepatocyte growth factor hgf cytokine profound effect cell stimulate migration invasion act angiogenic factor lung factor also play pivotal role link poor outcome particular hgf know work combination egf lung cell present investigate effect traditional chinese medicine report therapy namely yangzheng xiaoji yzxj lung hgf mediate migration invasion lung cell human lung cell skmes use extract medicine use cell migration investigate use evos ecis cell matrix adhesion,c,Lung Cancer
"PPAR γ changing ALDH1A3 content to regulate lipid metabolism and inhibit lung cancer cell growth. PPAR γ, as a widely present receptor in tissues, plays a key role in lipid metabolism, energy balance, inflammatory response, and cell differentiation. It plays an important role in the occurrence and development of various tumors, including prostate cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, etc., by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the specific mechanism by which it affects lung cancer growth is not yet clear. To investigate how PPAR γ affects lung cancer cell growth by altering ALDH1A3 levels through its impact on lipid metabolism. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the correlation between PPAR γ, ALDH1A3 and lung cancer. Based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, PPAR γ activator (Pioglitazone, Pio) and ALDH1A3 inhibitor (diethylaminobenzaldehyde, DEAB) were used to act on lung cancer cells and observe their growth. After measuring the IC50 value of the drug in vitro experiments, lipid metabolomics analysis was conducted to identify the significant changes in differential metabolites and metabolic pathways under the combined influence of Pio and DEAB. Through bioinformatics analysis, it was found that there were significant differences in the levels of PPAR γ and ALDH1A3 between lung cancer and normal lung tissues, and ALDH1A3 was positively correlated with PPAR γ. AUC analysis found that PPAR γ and ALDH1A3 have good predictive value in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer. GSEA enrichment analysis showed that PPAR γ and ALDH1A3 were significantly correlated with lipid oxidation. Combining relevant literature to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PPAR γ receptors on lung cancer cells and the ability of PPAR γ activation to inhibit ALDH1A3 levels. Further in vitro CCK-8 and IC50 measurements of lung cancer cells A549 and H1299 were conducted, followed by non targeted lipidomics analysis. It was found that the metabolic pathways upregulated by activation of PPAR γ and inhibition of ALDH1A3 included glycerophospholipid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and fat digestion and absorption, with glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway accounting for the highest percentage. Conclusion: PPAR γ activation can inhibit the production of ALDH1A3, alter the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, and thus inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells. This study confirms that PPAR γ affects lung cancer proliferation by influencing the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway.","ppar γ changing aldh1a3 content to regulate lipid metabolism and inhibit lung cancer cell growth. ppar γ, as a widely present receptor in tissues, plays a key role in lipid metabolism, energy balance, inflammatory response, and cell differentiation. it plays an important role in the occurrence and development of various tumors, including prostate cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, etc., by regulating lipid metabolism. however, the specific mechanism by which it affects lung cancer growth is not yet clear. to investigate how ppar γ affects lung cancer cell growth by altering aldh1a3 levels through its impact on lipid metabolism. bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the correlation between ppar γ, aldh1a3 and lung cancer. based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, ppar γ activator (pioglitazone, pio) and aldh1a3 inhibitor (diethylaminobenzaldehyde, deab) were used to act on lung cancer cells and observe their growth. after measuring the ic50 value of the drug",ppar change aldh content regulate lipid metabolism inhibit lung cell growth ppar widely present receptor tissue play key role lipid metabolism energy balance inflammatory response cell differentiation play important role occurrence development various include prostate gastric lung etc regulate lipid metabolism however specific mechanism affect lung growth yet clear investigate ppar affect lung cell growth alter aldh level impact lipid metabolism bioinformatics use predict correlation ppar aldh lung base result bioinformatics ppar activator pioglitazone pio aldh inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde deab use act lung cell observe growth measure ic value drug,c,Lung Cancer

"Analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Fas/FasL in Japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer associated with HLA-A2. Abstract ; Purpose. In recent years, the use of immunotherapy for malignant tumors has been proposed. To explore the significance of immunotherapy for lung cancer, we examined two systems : the HLA class I and cancer-reactive CTL system, and the Fas-FasL system. ; Methods. HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) antigens were determined in 61 patients with lung cancer and in 30 healthy controls. The HLA class I phenotype was investigated by serological techniques. HLA-A2 alleles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer analysis. We analyzed lymphocytes isolated from 61 patients with two-color surface labeling and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we analyzed sFas and sFasL expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also examined lung cancer cell line-induced apoptosis of CD8+ lymphocytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy. ; Results. The HLA-A2 allele was observed in 27 of 61 patients with lung cancer. There were no differences in HLA-A2 allele classifications between lung cancer patients and controls. Thirty-six of the 61 lung cancer patients (57%) had elevated levels of sFas, and 16 of the 61 patients (26.2%) had elevated levels of sFasL. The sFas level of lung cancers with HLA-A2 was significantly higher than that of cancers without HLA-A2 (P<0.01). This tendency was observed in every lung cancer tissue type, and the sFas levels of lung cancers with HLA-A2 associated significantly with the CTL levels of lung cancers with HLA-A2. Furthermore, compared to lung cancers without HLA-A2, CD8+ T-cell levels were elevated in lung cancers with HLA-A2. In contrast, sFas levels of non-small cell lung cancers without HLA-A2 were higher than those in lung cancers with HLA-A2. In an in vitro experiment using lung cancer cell lines, we observed apoptosis of CD8+ lymphocytes induced by lung cancer cells. Lung cancer-reactive CTLs are mobilized easily by restriction of HLA-A2, but this restriction is not always specific. In addition, FasL derived from lung cancer cells can induce apoptosis of CD8+ T-cells, and the frequency of this phenomenon is increased in small cell lung cancers without HLA-A2. ; Conclusion. Our findings suggest that the effect of immunotherapy may be insufficient for non-small cell lung cancer without HLA-A2.","analysis of cytotoxic t lymphocytes and fas/fasl in japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer associated with hla-a2. abstract ; purpose. in recent years, the use of immunotherapy for malignant tumors has been proposed. to explore the significance of immunotherapy for lung cancer, we examined two systems : the hla class i and cancer-reactive ctl system, and the fas-fasl system. ; methods. hla class i (hla-a, -b, and -c) antigens were determined in 61 patients with lung cancer and in 30 healthy controls. the hla class i phenotype was investigated by serological techniques. hla-a2 alleles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer analysis. we analyzed lymphocytes isolated from 61 patients with two-color surface labeling and flow cytometry. furthermore, we analyzed sfas and sfasl expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). we also examined lung cancer cell line-induced apoptosis of cd8+ lymphocytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy. ; results. the hla-a2",cytotoxic lymphocyte fas fasl japanese non small cell lung associate hla abstract recent year use immunotherapy malignant propose explore significance immunotherapy lung examine two system hla class reactive ctl system fa fasl system method hla class hla b c antigen determine lung healthy control hla class phenotype investigate serological technique hla allele investigate polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primer analyze lymphocyte isolate two color surface labeling flow cytometry furthermore analyze sfas sfasl expression enzyme link immunosorbent assay elisa also examine lung cell line induce apoptosis cd lymphocyte use confocal laser scan microscopy result hla,c,Lung Cancer

"Identification of a panel of sensitive and specific DNA methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women in the United States. Three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%. DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral CT, improving early detection. In lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum. To date the penetrance of DNA methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. We used the real-time PCR-based method MethyLight to examine DNA methylation quantitatively at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples from non-lung cancer patients. We identified thirteen loci showing significant differential DNA methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor lung; eight of these show highly significant hypermethylation in adenocarcinoma: CDH13, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1, OPCML, RASSF1, SFPR1, and TWIST1 (p-value << 0.0001). Using the current tissue collection and 5-fold cross validation, the four most significant loci (CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML) individually distinguish lung adenocarcinoma from non-cancer lung with a sensitivity of 67–86% and specificity of 74–82%. DNA methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers. We applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The identification of eight CpG island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum. The four most highly ranked loci, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML, which show significant DNA methylation even in stage IA tumor samples, merit further investigation as some of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date.","identification of a panel of sensitive and specific dna methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women in the united states. three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%. dna hypermethylation at promoter cpg islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral ct, improving early detection. in lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum. to date the penetrance of dna methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. we used the real-time pcr-based method methylight to examine dna methylation quantitatively at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples",identification panel sensitive specific dna methylation marker lung adenocarcinoma lung number one killer men woman united state three quarter lung diagnose regionally distantly disseminate year survival dna hypermethylation promoter cpg islands show great promise specific marker would complement visual lung screen tool spiral ct improve early detection lung hypermethylation detectable variety sample range material blood sputum date penetrance dna methylation single locus low provide great sensitivity use real time pcr base method methylight examine dna methylation quantitatively twenty eight locus primary human lung adenocarcinoma adjacent non lung sample lung sample,c,Lung Cancer

"WNT pathway inhibition sensitizes HAT1-high lung cancers to treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Background Immunotherapies change the paradigm of current pulmonary oncological clinics, although majority of patients fail to benefit from these treatment modalities. HAT1 overexpression is frequently diagnosed in lung cancer patients. Effective immunotherapeutic scheme remains to be determined for this portion of patients. Methods In vitro experiments were used to verify the transcriptional regulation of PD-L1 by HAT1 in lung cancer cells. Mouse syngeneic lung tumors with sgHAT1 were treated with PD-1 antibodies to determine the impact of deficiency of HAT1 on the sensitivity of lung cancers to PD-1 inhibitors. RNA-seq and Chip-seq analyses revealed the effect of HAT1 on the WNT pathway. The impact of HAT1 on WNT signaling on stemness of lung cancer cells and their ability to escape immune surveillance were evaluated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Clinical relevance of expression level of HAT1 on prognosis of lung cancer patients were assessed using data from multiple public datasets. Carcinogenicity of HAT1 was evaluated using a transgenic mouse model in vivo. Results Silencing HAT1 expression downregulated PD-L1 expression in murine and human lung cancer cells. Notably, HAT1-knockout sensitized lung cancers to PD-1 antibody treatment. We found that HAT1 enhanced the stemness of lung cancer cells through enhancing expression of WNT ligands by direct binding of their promoter regions. WNT pathway inhibitor, ICG001, sensitized lung tumors to treatment with PD-1 antibody. HAT1 overexpression was highly frequent among lung cancer patients and was found transforming in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo. Conclusion This study demonstrates that overexpression HAT1 plays a critical role in mediating immune evasion in lung cancer. Mechanistically, on one hand, HAT1 upregulate PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells. On the other hand, HAT1 enhances stem-like properties of lung cancer cells by upregulating several WNT ligands. Consequently, combined inhibition of the WNT pathway and PD-1 signaling effectively shrinks HAT1-high lung cancers. These findings highlight the critical role of HAT1 overexpression in lung cancer development and shed light on potential precision medicine for this portion of lung cancer patients.

"The imbalance in the complement system and its possible physiological mechanisms in patients with lung cancer. The clinical and experimental evidences for complement-cancer relationships are solid, whereas an epidemiological study reporting the imbalance of complement system in patients is still lacking. Using publicly available databases, we jointly compared the levels of complement components in plasma and lung cancer tissues. With iTRAQ proteomics, quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, we analysed the differences in complement levels in lung cancer tissues and normal control tissues. Complement components are mainly synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. Using paired co-cultures of human normal QSG-7701 hepatocytes with lung cancer cells (A549, LTEP-α-2 or NCI-H1703) or human normal bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, we examined the effects of lung cancer cells on complement synthesis and secretion in QSG-7701 hepatocytes. An integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome datasets from 43 previous studies revealed lower mRNA and protein levels of 25 complement and complement-related components in lung cancer tissues than those in normal control tissues; conversely, higher levels of complement proteins were detected in plasma from patients than those in healthy subjects. Our iTRAQ proteome study identified decreased and increased levels of 31 and 2 complement and complement-related proteins, respectively, in lung cancer tissues, of which the reduced levels of 10 components were further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Paired co-cultures of QSG-7701 hepatocytes with A549, LTEP-α-2, NCI-H1703 or HBE cells indicated that lung cancer cells increased complement synthesis and secretion in QSG-7701 cells compared to HBE cells. The opposite associations between the levels of complement and complement-related components in lung cancer tissues and plasma from patients that have been repeatedly reported by independent publications may indicate the prevalence of an imbalance in the complement system of lung cancer patients. The possible mechanism of the imbalance may be associated not only with the decreased complement levels in lung cancer tissues but also the concurrent lung cancer tissue-induced increase in hepatocyte complement synthesis and plasma secretion in patients. And the imbalance should be accompanied by a suppression of complement-dependent immunity in lung cancer tissues coupled with a burden of complement immunity in the circulation of patients.","the imbalance in the complement system and its possible physiological mechanisms in patients with lung cancer. the clinical and experimental evidences for complement-cancer relationships are solid, whereas an epidemiological study reporting the imbalance of complement system in patients is still lacking. using publicly available databases, we jointly compared the levels of complement components in plasma and lung cancer tissues. with itraq proteomics, quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting, we analysed the differences in complement levels in lung cancer tissues and normal control tissues. complement components are mainly synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. using paired co-cultures of human normal qsg-7701 hepatocytes with lung cancer cells (a549, ltep-α-2 or nci-h1703) or human normal bronchial epithelial (hbe) cells, we examined the effects of lung cancer cells on complement synthesis and secretion in qsg-7701 hepatocytes. an integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome datasets from 43 previous studies revealed lower mrna and",imbalance complement system possible physiological mechanism lung experimental evidence complement relationship solid whereas epidemiological report imbalance complement system still lack use publicly available database jointly compare level complement component plasma lung tissue itraq proteomics quantitative rt pcr western blotting analyse difference complement level lung tissue normal control tissue complement component mainly synthesize liver secrete blood use pair co culture human normal qsg hepatocytes lung cell ltep nci h human normal bronchial epithelial hbe cell examine effect lung cell complement synthesis secretion qsg hepatocytes integrated transcriptome proteome datasets previous reveal low mrna,c,Lung Cancer
"Nicotine promotes the progression and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by modulating the OTUB1-c-Myc-EZH2 axis. Smoking has been identified as a major risk factor for the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a key component of tobacco smoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth and progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor tissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression of EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC samples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on EZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of nicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by OTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both bioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and promotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. Inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA significantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells induced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine induces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and enables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated deubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells.

"KLF8 overexpression promotes the growth of human lung cancer cells by promoting the expression of JMJD2A Non-small-cell lung cancer (lung cancer) has become one of the leading causes worldwide and the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The transcriptional factor Kruppel like factor 8 (KLF8) is involved in the initiation, progression, transformation, and metastasis of diverse cancers. However, the roles of KLF8 in human non-small cell lung cancer remain unknown. CCK-8 kit and colony formation assay were performed to determine the cell growth of lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry analysis was used to evaluate apoptosis and cell cycle of lung cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the activation of JMJD2A promoter by KLF8. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to evaluate the binding of KLF8 to JMJD2A promoter. Western blot and polymerase chain reaction were applied to analyze the expression of interested genes. The mRNA and protein levels of KLF8 in human non-small cell lung cancer tissues were overexpressed compared with the non-cancer tissues. KLF8 was knocked down with lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human lung cancer cells (A549 and H1299 cells). The phenotypic results showed that KLF8 knockdown decreased the proliferation rate and colony formation of lung cancer cells. By contrast, lentivirus-mediated KLF8 overexpression promoted the growth of lung cancer cells (A549 and H1299 cells) and non-cancerous bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Next, we showed that KLF8 regulated cell cycle at the G0 phase but not regulates cellular apoptosis of lung cancer cells. KLF8 regulated the expression of the cell cycle regulators P21 and CDK4 in a JMJD2A-dependent manner and JMJD2A knockdown significantly blocked the functions of KLF8 in regulating cell cycle and proliferation of lung cancer cells. Finally, we observed that KLF8 bound the promoter of JMJD2A and facilitated the expression of JMJD2A. Our evidence demonstrated that KLF8 upregulation in human lung cancer promotes the cell proliferation and colony formation of lung cancer cells. KLF8 binds to the promoter of JMJD2A and subsequently regulates the expression of P21 and CDK4, which contributes to the regulation of cell cycle by KLF8.

"CLEC3B as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in lung cancer and association with the immune microenvironment Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Discovering effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis is important to reduce the mortality rate and ensure efficient therapy for lung cancer patients. C-type lectin domain family 3 member B (CLEC3B) has been reported in various cancers, but its correlation with lung cancer remains elusive. The GEO, TCGA and Oncomine databases were analyzed to examine the expression of CLEC3B in lung cancer. The CLEC3B mRNA levels in 15 patient tissue samples were detected by real-time PCR and the CLEC3B protein levels in 34 patient tissue samples were detected by immunohistochemistry. A Chi-square test was performed to analyze the correlation of CLEC3B expression and clinicopathological factors. The diagnostic value of CLEC3B was revealed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan–Meier plots were used to evaluate the prognostic value of CLEC3B in lung cancer. The TIMER database was used to evaluate the correlation of CLEC3B and immune infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed tumor‐associated biological processes related to CLEC3B. CLEC3B is significantly downregulated in lung cancer patients compared with nontumor controls according to database analysis and patient tissue sample detection (p   0.9). Moreover, low expression of CLEC3B is related to poor progression-free survival (HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.49–0.74, p = 8.3e−07) and overall survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.58–0.75, p = 2.1e−10), indicating it as a risk factor for lung cancer. Multivariate analysis value showed that low expression of CLEC3B may be an independent risk factor for disease‐free survival in lung cancer patients (HR = 0.655, 95% CI 0.430–0.996, Cox p = 0.048). In addition, we also investigated the potential role of CLEC3B in tumor-immune interactions and found that CLEC3B might be associated with the immune infiltration and immune activation of lung cancer, especially in squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings indicate that CLEC3B expression is downregulated in lung cancer and reveal the diagnostic and prognostic potential of CLEC3B in lung cancer and its potential as an immune-related therapeutic target in lung cancer.","clec3b as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in lung cancer and association with the immune microenvironment lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. discovering effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis is important to reduce the mortality rate and ensure efficient therapy for lung cancer patients. c-type lectin domain family 3 member b (clec3b) has been reported in various cancers, but its correlation with lung cancer remains elusive. the geo, tcga and oncomine databases were analyzed to examine the expression of clec3b in lung cancer. the clec3b mrna levels in 15 patient tissue samples were detected by real-time pcr and the clec3b protein levels in 34 patient tissue samples were detected by immunohistochemistry. a chi-square test was performed to analyze the correlation of clec3b expression and clinicopathological factors. the diagnostic value of clec3b was revealed by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. univariate and multivariate cox proportional",clec b potential diagnostic prognostic biomarker lung association immune microenvironment lung lead cause relate mortality globally discover effective biomarkers early diagnosis prognosis important reduce mortality rate ensure efficient therapy lung c type lectin domain family member b clec b report various correlation lung remain elusive geo tcga oncomine database analyze examine expression clec b lung clec b mrna level tissue sample detect real time pcr clec b protein level tissue sample detect immunohistochemistry chi square test perform analyze correlation clec b expression clinicopathological factor diagnostic value clec b reveal receiver operate characteristic roc curve univariate multivariate cox proportional,c,Lung Cancer

This study was designed to investigate the gene expression differences between AIS (formerly non–mucinous BAC) and invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA, formerly non-mucinous BAC pattern with >5 mm invasion, mixed type adenocarcinoma with BAC features) and to investigate the mechanism of the progression of lung adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma. Gene expression analysis was performed by using Agilent 4 × 44 K Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray on 10 fresh frozen tissue samples of AIS and LPA, respectively. Real time RT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of 13 genes selected by cDNA microarray on fresh frozen tissue samples from 41 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 4 genes were confirmed. These 4 genes were then validated by western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining for these validated genes was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 81 cases of lung adenocarcinomna. We identified a 13 gene expression signature by comparative analysis of gene expression. Expression of these genes strongly differed between AIS and LPA. Four genes (MMP-2, c-fos, claudin 1 (CLDN1) and claudin 10(CLDN10)) were correlated with the results of microarray and real time RT-PCR analyses for the gene-expression data in samples from 41 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. As confirmed by western blotting, the expression levels of MMP-2 and c-fos were higher in LPA than those in AIS; the expression levels of CLDN1 and CLDN10 in LPA were lower than those in AIS. Immunohistochemical staining for these genes in samples from 81 cases of lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated the expressions of CLDN1 and CLDN10 were correlated with overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. CLDN1 and CLDN10 may play important roles in the development of AIS to LPA. Overexpression of CLDN1 and CLDN10 indicates a favorable prognosis for overall survival in some patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Expression of CLDN10 may be regulated by the c-fos pathway.","expression of cldn1 and cldn10 in lung adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (bac) is considered the early stage of lung adenocarcinoma and is classified as the lung adenocarcioma in situ (ais) by the international association for the study of lung cancer/american thoracic society/european respiratory society. this study was designed to investigate the gene expression differences between ais (formerly non–mucinous bac) and invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (lpa, formerly non-mucinous bac pattern with >5 mm invasion, mixed type adenocarcinoma with bac features) and to investigate the mechanism of the progression of lung adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma. gene expression analysis was performed by using agilent 4 × 44 k whole human genome oligo microarray on 10 fresh frozen tissue samples of ais and lpa, respectively. real time rt-pcr was used to validate the differential expression of 13 genes selected by cdna microarray on fresh frozen",expression cldn cldn lung adenocarcinoma situ invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma non mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma bac consider early stage lung adenocarcinoma classify lung adenocarcioma situ ai international association lung american thoracic society european respiratory society design investigate gene expression difference ai formerly non mucinous bac invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma lpa formerly non mucinous bac pattern mm invasion mixed type adenocarcinoma bac feature investigate mechanism progression lung adenocarcinoma situ invasive adenocarcinoma gene expression perform use agilent k whole human genome oligo microarray fresh frozen tissue sample ai lpa respectively real time rt pcr use validate differential expression gene select cdna microarray fresh frozen,c,Lung Cancer

"Evidence for tankyrases as antineoplastic targets in lung cancer New pharmacologic targets are urgently needed to treat or prevent lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death for men and women. This study identified one such target. This is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is deregulated in cancers, including those lacking adenomatous polyposis coli or β-catenin mutations. Two poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes regulate canonical Wnt activity: tankyrase (TNKS) 1 and TNKS2. These enzymes poly-ADP-ribosylate (PARsylate) and destabilize axin, a key component of the β-catenin phosphorylation complex. This study used comprehensive gene profiles to uncover deregulation of the Wnt pathway in murine transgenic and human lung cancers, relative to normal lung. Antineoplastic consequences of genetic and pharmacologic targeting of TNKS in murine and human lung cancer cell lines were explored, and validated in vivo in mice by implantation of murine transgenic lung cancer cells engineered with reduced TNKS expression relative to controls. Microarray analyses comparing Wnt pathway members in malignant versus normal tissues of a murine transgenic cyclin E lung cancer model revealed deregulation of Wnt pathway components, including TNKS1 and TNKS2. Real-time PCR assays independently confirmed these results in paired normal-malignant murine and human lung tissues. Individual treatments of a panel of human and murine lung cancer cell lines with the TNKS inhibitors XAV939 and IWR-1 dose-dependently repressed cell growth and increased cellular axin 1 and tankyrase levels. These inhibitors also repressed expression of a Wnt-responsive luciferase construct, implicating the Wnt pathway in conferring these antineoplastic effects. Individual or combined knockdown of TNKS1 and TNKS2 with siRNAs or shRNAs reduced lung cancer cell growth, stabilized axin, and repressed tumor formation in murine xenograft and syngeneic lung cancer models. Findings reported here uncovered deregulation of specific components of the Wnt pathway in both human and murine lung cancer models. Repressing TNKS activity through either genetic or pharmacological approaches antagonized canonical Wnt signaling, reduced murine and human lung cancer cell line growth, and decreased tumor formation in mouse models. Taken together, these findings implicate the use of TNKS inhibitors to target the Wnt pathway to combat lung cancer.","evidence for tankyrases as antineoplastic targets in lung cancer new pharmacologic targets are urgently needed to treat or prevent lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death for men and women. this study identified one such target. this is the canonical wnt signaling pathway, which is deregulated in cancers, including those lacking adenomatous polyposis coli or β-catenin mutations. two poly-adp-ribose polymerase (parp) enzymes regulate canonical wnt activity: tankyrase (tnks) 1 and tnks2. these enzymes poly-adp-ribosylate (parsylate) and destabilize axin, a key component of the β-catenin phosphorylation complex. this study used comprehensive gene profiles to uncover deregulation of the wnt pathway in murine transgenic and human lung cancers, relative to normal lung. antineoplastic consequences of genetic and pharmacologic targeting of tnks in murine and human lung cancer cell lines were explored, and validated in vivo in mice by implantation of murine transgenic lung cancer cells engineered with reduced tnks expression",evidence tankyrases antineoplastic target lung new pharmacologic target urgently need treat prevent lung common cause death men woman identify one target canonical wnt signal pathway deregulate include lack adenomatous polyposis coli catenin mutation two poly adp ribose polymerase parp enzyme regulate canonical wnt activity tankyrase tnks tnks enzyme poly adp ribosylate parsylate destabilize axin key component catenin phosphorylation complex use comprehensive gene profile uncover deregulation wnt pathway murine transgenic human lung relative normal lung antineoplastic consequence genetic pharmacologic targeting tnks murine human lung cell line explore validate vivo mouse implantation murine transgenic lung cell engineer reduced tnks expression,c,Lung Cancer
"EZH2 inhibitors reverse resistance to gefitinib in primary EGFR wild-type lung cancer cells. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. In traditional anti-cancer therapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been proven to be beneficial for patients with EGFR mutations. However, patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC were usually not respond to EGFR-TKIs. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a key molecular in the PRC2 complex and plays an important role in epigenetic regulation and is overexpressed in variant tumors. EZH2 inhibitors have been reported to sensitize variant tumor cells to anticancer drugs. This study aimed to investigate whether the EZH2 inhibitors, GSK343 and DZNep when combined with gefitinib can reverse EGFR-TKIs resistance in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells. The RNA-sequencing data of patients with NSCLC [502 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, including 49 paracancerous lung tissues and 513 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), including 59 paracancerous lung tissues] from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), were analyzed for EZH2 expression. EZH2 expression was verified in 40 NSCLC tissue cancer samples and their corresponding paracancerous tissues from our institute (TJMUGH) via RT-PCR. A549 and H1299 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors were subjected to cell viability and apoptosis analyses as well to EGFR pathway proteins expression analyses via western blotting. EZH2 was upregulated in human NSCLC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis in patients with LUAD based on data from both TCGA and TJMUGH. Both GSK343 and DZNep sensitized EGFR wild-type LUAD cells (A549 and H1299) to gefitinib and suppressed cell viability and proliferation in vitro by downregulating the phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT and by inducing cell apoptosis. Co-administration of EZH2 inhibitors (GSK343 or DZNep) with gefitinib exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor activity, cell proliferation and cell migration than single drug administration in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the combination of EZH2 inhibitors with EGFR-TKIs may be an effective method for treating NSCLC-patients with EGFR-wild type, who do not want to undergo traditional treatment with chemotherapy.","ezh2 inhibitors reverse resistance to gefitinib in primary egfr wild-type lung cancer cells. lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. in traditional anti-cancer therapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tki) have been proven to be beneficial for patients with egfr mutations. however, patients with egfr wild-type nsclc were usually not respond to egfr-tkis. enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2) is a key molecular in the prc2 complex and plays an important role in epigenetic regulation and is overexpressed in variant tumors. ezh2 inhibitors have been reported to sensitize variant tumor cells to anticancer drugs. this study aimed to investigate whether the ezh2 inhibitors, gsk343 and dznep when combined with gefitinib can reverse egfr-tkis resistance in egfr wild-type nsclc cells. the rna-sequencing data of patients with nsclc [502 patients with lung squamous cell",ezh inhibitor reverse resistance gefitinib primary egfr wild type lung cell lung lead cause relate death worldwide non small cell lung nsclc common type lung traditional anti therapy epidermal growth factor receptor egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki prove beneficial egfr mutation however egfr wild type nsclc usually respond egfr tkis enhancer zeste homolog ezh key molecular prc complex play important role epigenetic regulation overexpressed variant ezh inhibitor report sensitize variant cell anticancer drug investigate whether ezh inhibitor gsk dznep combine gefitinib reverse egfr tkis resistance egfr wild type nsclc cell rna sequence data nsclc lung squamous cell,c,Lung Cancer
"Spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China Lung cancer is the most common cancer in China. Previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. However, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China remains unclear. In this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in China in 2013 with annual concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 were analysed. GeoDetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer. An apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. Among the six selected pollutants, SO2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q = 0.154 in females) in north China. In the south, each selected pollutant has a significant impact on males or females, and the mean q value in the south is 0.181, which is bigger than that in the north (q = 0.154). In addition, the pollutants have evident non-linear interaction effects on lung cancer. In north China, the interaction between SO2 and PM2.5 is the dominant interaction, with q values of 0.207 in males and 0.334 in females. In the south, the dominant interactive factors are between SO2 and O3 in males and between SO2 and CO in females, with q values of 0.45, 0.232 respectively. Smoking is a substantial contributor to lung cancer among men, either in South or North China, with q value of 0.143 and 0.129 respectively, and the interaction between smoking and air pollutants increases this risk. This study implies that the influence of SO2 and PM2.5 on lung cancer should be focused on in north China, and in the south, the impact of O3 and CO as well as their interaction with SO2 need to be paid more attention. Smoking, particularly in men, remains a significant risk factor for lung cancer in both North and South China.","spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in china lung cancer is the most common cancer in china. previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. however, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in china remains unclear. in this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in china in 2013 with annual concentrations of pm2.5, pm10, so2, no2, co and o3 were analysed. geodetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer. an apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. among the six selected pollutants, so2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q = 0.154",spatial association outdoor air pollution lung incidence china lung common china previous indicate lung incidence exhibit remarkable spatial heterogeneity lung relate outdoor air pollution however non linear spatial association outdoor air pollution lung incidence china remains unclear relationship lung incidence male female county china annual concentration pm pm co analyse geodetector q statistic use examine non linear spatial association outdoor air pollution incidence lung apparent spatial population gender heterogeneity find spatial association outdoor air pollution lung incidence among six select pollutant great influence lung q,c,Lung Cancer
"Serum C-reactive protein and risk of lung cancer: a case–control study Recent advances in lung cancer biology presuppose their inflammatory origin. Thus, CRP is regarded to play a key role in the development of lung cancer. Nevertheless, this interesting hypothesis and the role of inflammation in tumor biology remain complex and incompletely sure. Meanwhile, the association between CRP and risk of lung cancer was not stable in many published results. This study was conducted to evaluate the association between serum CRP and SNPs in the aspect of lung cancer risks, in order to assess its possible diagnostic and prognostic importance. We conducted a case-control study of 96 patients newly diagnosed of lung cancer and 124 controls in this research. Controls were individuals matched to lung cancer cases on age, gender and tobacco use. In order to increase the statistical power, never smokers were matched to patients by using a 3:1 ratio, whereas former and current smokers were matched equal to the patients. CRP concentrations were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay, and SNPs were assessed at five loci within the CRP gene (rs1417938, rs1800947, rs1205, rs2808630 and rs3093077) as part of a Golden Gate assay. Logistic regression was used to calculate OR and 95 % CI for lung cancer. CRP concentrations tended to be in positive association with lung cancer risk in our research (Q4 vs Q1: OR = 2.11, 95 % CI, 1.66-2.91, p trend < 0.01). Although CRP SNPs were related to CRP levels, they were not associated with lung cancer risk.

"Comparison between immunotherapy efficacy in early non-small cell lung cancer and advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Currently, immunotherapy is widely used in the treatment of various stages of non-small cell lung cancer. According to clinical experience and results of previous studies, immunotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy seems to exhibit better efficacy against early resectable non-small cell lung cancer as compared to advanced lung cancer, which is often defined as unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. However, this observation has not been established in clinical studies. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy in early and late lung cancer, wherein objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were used as evaluation indexes.

"Long-term exposure to hypoxia inhibits tumor progression of lung cancer in rats and mice Hypoxia has been identified as a major negative factor for tumor progression in clinical observations and in animal studies. However, the precise role of hypoxia in tumor progression has not been fully explained. In this study, we extensively investigated the effect of long-term exposure to hypoxia on tumor progression in vivo.;  Rats bearing transplanted tumors consisting of A549 human lung cancer cells (lung cancer tumor) were exposed to hypoxia for different durations and different levels of oxygen. The tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated. We also treated A549 lung cancer cells (A549 cells) with chronic hypoxia and then implanted the hypoxia-pretreated cancer cells into mice. The effect of exposure to hypoxia on metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice was also investigated. We found that long-term exposure to hypoxia a) significantly inhibited lung cancer tumor growth in xenograft and orthotopic models in rats, b) significantly reduced lymphatic metastasis of the lung cancer in rats and decreased lung metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice, c) reduced lung cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in vitro, d) decreased growth of the tumors from hypoxia-pretreated A549 cells, e) decreased Na+-K+ ATPase α1 expression in hypoxic lung cancer tumors, and f) increased expression of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1α and HIF2α) but decreased microvessel density in the lung cancer tumors. In contrast to lung cancer, the growth of tumor from HCT116 human colon cancer cells (colon cancer tumor) was a) significantly enhanced in the same hypoxia conditions, accompanied by b) no significant change in expression of Na+-K+ ATPase α1, c) increased HIF1α expression (no HIF2α was detected) and d) increased microvessel density in the tumor tissues. This study demonstrated that long-term exposure to hypoxia repressed tumor progression of the lung cancer from A549 cells and that decreased expression of Na+-K+ ATPase was involved in hypoxic inhibition of tumor progression.

"Five-gene prognostic model based on autophagy-dependent cell death for predicting prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the predominant form of lung cancer originating from lung epithelial cells, making it the most prevalent pathological type. Currently, reliable indicators for predicting treatment efficacy and disease prognosis are lacking. Despite extensive validation of autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD) in solid tumor studies and its correlation with immunotherapy effectiveness and cancer prognosis, systematic research on ADCD-related genes in LUAD is limited. We utilized AddModuleScore, ssGSEA, and WGCNA to identify genes associated with ADCD across single-cell and bulk transcriptome datasets. The TCGA dataset, comprising 598 cases, was randomly divided into training and validation sets to develop an ADCD-related LUAD prediction model. Internal validation was performed using the TCGA validation set. For external validation, datasets GSE13213 (119 LUAD samples), GSE26939 (115 LUAD samples), GSE29016 (39 LUAD samples), and GSE30219 (86 LUAD samples) were employed. We evaluated the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting prognostic risk. Additionally, CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA techniques were used to explore immunological characteristics, drug response, and gene expression in LUAD. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted to assess variations in mRNA expression levels of the gene XCR1 between cancerous and normal tissues in 10 lung cancer patients. We identified 249 genes associated with autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD) at both single-cell and bulk transcriptome levels. Univariate COX regression analysis revealed that 18 genes were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Using LASSO-Cox analysis, we developed an ADCD signature based on five genes (BIRC3, TAP1, SLAMF1, XCR1, and HLA-DMB) and created the ADCD-related risk scoring system (ADCDRS). Validation of this model demonstrated its ability to predict disease prognosis and its correlation with clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration, and the tumor microenvironment. To enhance clinical applicability, we integrated an ADCDRS nomogram. Furthermore, we identified potential drugs targeting specific risk subgroups. We successfully identified a model based on five ADCD genes to predict disease prognosis and treatment efficacy in LUAD, as well as to assess the tumor immune microenvironment.

"Potential genetic modifiers for somatic EGFR mutation in lung cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review Accumulating evidence indicates inherited risk in the aetiology of lung cancer, although smoking exposure is the major attributing factor. Family history is a simple substitute for inherited susceptibility. Previous studies have shown some possible yet conflicting links between family history of cancer and EGFR mutation in lung cancer. As EGFR-mutated lung cancer favours female, never-smoker, adenocarcinoma and Asians, it may be argued that there may be some underlying genetic modifiers responsible for the pathogenesis of EGFR mutation. We searched four databases for all original articles on family history of malignancy and EGFR mutation status in lung cancer published up to July 2018. We performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model and odds ratio estimates. Heterogeneity and sensitivity were also investigated. Then we conducted a second literature research to curate case reports of familial lung cancers who studied both germline cancer predisposing genes and their somatic EGFR mutation status; and explored the possible links between cancer predisposing genes and EGFR mutation. Eleven studies have been included in the meta-analysis. There is a significantly higher likelihood of EGFR mutation in lung cancer patients with family history of cancer than their counterparts without family history, preferentially in Asians (OR = 1.35[1.06–1.71], P = 0.01), those diagnosed with adenocarcinomas ((OR = 1.47[1.14–1.89], P = 0.003) and those with lung cancer-affected relatives (first and second-degree: OR = 1.53[1.18–1.99], P = 0.001; first-degree: OR = 1.76[1.36–2.28, P < 0.0001]). Familial lung cancers more likely have concurrent EGFR mutations along with mutations in their germline cancer predisposition genes including EGFR T790 M, BRCA2 and TP53. Certain mechanisms may contribute to the combination preferences between inherited mutations and somatic ones. Potential genetic modifiers may contribute to somatic EGFR mutation in lung cancer, although current data is limited. Further studies on this topic are needed, which may help to unveil lung carcinogenesis pathways. However, caution is warranted in data interpretation due to limited cases available for the current study.","potential genetic modifiers for somatic egfr mutation in lung cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review accumulating evidence indicates inherited risk in the aetiology of lung cancer, although smoking exposure is the major attributing factor. family history is a simple substitute for inherited susceptibility. previous studies have shown some possible yet conflicting links between family history of cancer and egfr mutation in lung cancer. as egfr-mutated lung cancer favours female, never-smoker, adenocarcinoma and asians, it may be argued that there may be some underlying genetic modifiers responsible for the pathogenesis of egfr mutation. we searched four databases for all original articles on family history of malignancy and egfr mutation status in lung cancer published up to july 2018. we performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model and odds ratio estimates. heterogeneity and sensitivity were also investigated. then we conducted a second literature research to curate case reports of familial lung",potential genetic modifier somatic egfr mutation lung meta literature review accumulate evidence indicates inherit risk aetiology lung although smoking exposure major attribute factor family history simple substitute inherited susceptibility previous show possible yet conflict link family history egfr mutation lung egfr mutate lung favour female never smoker adenocarcinoma asian may argue may underlying genetic modifier responsible pathogenesis egfr mutation search four database original article family history malignancy egfr mutation status lung publish july perform meta use random effect model odds ratio estimate heterogeneity sensitivity also investigate conduct second literature research curate report familial lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Reduction in arsenic intake from water has different impacts on lung cancer and bladder cancer in an arseniasis endemic area in Taiwan Excessive arsenic intake has a detrimental effect on human health, as reflected in an increase in cancer incidence. In an area on the southwest coast of Taiwan, arsenic intake from well water since the 1920s had caused an exceptionally high mortality from cancer. Municipal water has become available to people living in the arseniasis endemic area since the early 1970s. This study explored the impacts of reduction in arsenic intake from water on lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area in Taiwan. Chart records of 23,013 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and 93,633 patients with lung cancer from 1979 to 2003 were retrieved from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Center. We used the age-period-cohort model to study the changes in the incidence of lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area and the rest of Taiwan. Three decades after municipal water supply to the arseniasis and black foot disease endemic area (BFDEA), we saw a marked decrease in the incidence of both bladder cancer and lung cancer in the area, especially for those in the later cohorts. The relative risk (RR) of getting a bladder cancer for people living in BFDEA when compared with those in the rest of Taiwan has dropped from 20 for the early cohorts to 5 for the late cohorts. As to lung cancer, the RR has decreased from 8 to between 1.5 and 2. Reduction in arsenic intake from water has a positive impact on the incidence of both lung and bladder cancer; however, while RR for lung cancer has dropped to below 2, RR for bladder cancer remained at around 5. The difference may be because (1) there are other risk factors beside the well-water intake or (2) bladder cancer may have longer latency period for excessive arsenic exposure than lung cancer. More studies are required to understand the causes behind the difference in RR for these two types of cancer.","reduction in arsenic intake from water has different impacts on lung cancer and bladder cancer in an arseniasis endemic area in taiwan excessive arsenic intake has a detrimental effect on human health, as reflected in an increase in cancer incidence. in an area on the southwest coast of taiwan, arsenic intake from well water since the 1920s had caused an exceptionally high mortality from cancer. municipal water has become available to people living in the arseniasis endemic area since the early 1970s. this study explored the impacts of reduction in arsenic intake from water on lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area in taiwan. chart records of 23,013 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and 93,633 patients with lung cancer from 1979 to 2003 were retrieved from the taiwan cancer registry center. we used the age-period-cohort model to study the changes in the incidence of lung cancer and",reduction arsenic intake water different impact lung bladder arseniasis endemic area taiwan excessive arsenic intake detrimental effect human health reflect increase incidence area southwest coast taiwan arsenic intake well water since cause exceptionally high mortality municipal water become available people live arseniasis endemic area since early explore impact reduction arsenic intake water lung bladder arseniasis endemic area taiwan chart record diagnose bladder lung retrieve taiwan registry center use age period cohort model change incidence lung,c,Lung Cancer
"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms in colon and lung cancer patients N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolizes arylamines and hydrazines moeities found in many therapeutic drugs, chemicals and carcinogens. The gene encoding NAT2 is polymorphic, thus resulting in rapid or slow acetylator phenotypes. The acetylator status may, therefore, predispose drug-induced toxicities and cancer risks, such as bladder, colon and lung cancer. Indeed, some studies demonstrate a positive association between NAT2 rapid acetylator phenotype and colon cancer, but results are inconsistent. The role of NAT2 acetylation status in lung cancer is likewise unclear, in which both the rapid and slow acetylator genotypes have been associated with disease. We investigated three genetic variations, c.481C>T, c.590G>A (p.R197Q) and c.857G>A (p.G286E), of the NAT2 gene, which are known to result in a slow acetylator phenotype. Using validated PCR-RFLP assays, we genotyped 243 healthy unrelated Caucasian control subjects, 92 colon and 67 lung cancer patients for these genetic variations. As there is a recent meta-analysis of NAT2 studies on colon cancer (unlike in lung cancer), we have also undertaken a systematic review of NAT2 studies on lung cancer, and we incorporated our results in a meta-analysis consisting of 16 studies, 3,865 lung cancer patients and 6,077 control subjects. We did not obtain statistically significant differences in NAT2 allele and genotype frequencies in colon cancer patients and control group. Certain genotypes, however, such as [c.590AA+c.857GA] and [c.590GA+c.857GA] were absent among the colon cancer patients. Similarly, allele frequencies in lung cancer patients and controls did not differ significantly. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase of genotypes [c.590GA] and [c.481CT+c.590GA], but absence of homozygous c.590AA and [c.590AA+c.857GA] in the lung cancer group. Meta-analysis of 16 NAT2 studies on lung cancer did not evidence an overall association of the rapid or slow acetylator status to lung cancer. Similarly, the summary odds ratios obtained with stratified meta-analysis based on ethnicity, and smoking status were not significant.

"Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation after treatment for lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women and men in the United States. As of 1987, lung cancer deaths in women exceeded deaths caused by breast cancer. Despite years of research and improvements in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiation treatments, this fact remains unchanged. Equally dismal is that the expected 5-year survival rate for all patients with lung cancer is 15%. Although hidden in this number is improved survival for many patients who have early disease, it still translates into significant morbidity and early mortality for many patients. Although prevention is key, optimizing the care of these patients with lung cancer is also paramount. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs have been shown to be effective in treating patients with chronic heart and lung diseases, among other illnesses, regardless of prerehabilitation functioning. Not only do morbidity and mortality from cancer hinge directly on premorbid functioning, health, and status, but functional status as a measure of baseline health is a reliable prognostic indicator for patients with lung cancer. As a result, including a program of exercise in any treatment regimen for cancer is sensible. However, rehabilitation in patients with lung cancer has not been studied well. Data on rehabilitation in patients with other cancers and illnesses (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are clear in the beneficial effects of supervised exercise on quality of life (QOL). To assess the role of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in patients with lung cancer undergoing treatment, it is necessary to meld studies regarding patients with noncancerous conditions with studies addressing rehabilitation in patients with cancer. This fusion of information demonstrates that rehabilitation results in significant improvements in QOL in patients who participate, regardless of the disease in question. Although QOL may not always have been an obvious endpoint for treating patients with lung cancer, it is apparent from studies of the patients themselves that an improved QOL is far more important than other goals of therapy.","cardiopulmonary rehabilitation after treatment for lung cancer. lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women and men in the united states. as of 1987, lung cancer deaths in women exceeded deaths caused by breast cancer. despite years of research and improvements in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiation treatments, this fact remains unchanged. equally dismal is that the expected 5-year survival rate for all patients with lung cancer is 15%. although hidden in this number is improved survival for many patients who have early disease, it still translates into significant morbidity and early mortality for many patients. although prevention is key, optimizing the care of these patients with lung cancer is also paramount. cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs have been shown to be effective in treating patients with chronic heart and lung diseases, among other illnesses, regardless of prerehabilitation functioning. not only do morbidity and mortality from cancer hinge directly on",cardiopulmonary rehabilitation lung lung lead cause relate death woman men united state lung death woman exceed death cause breast despite year research improvement surgical chemotherapeutic radiation fact remain unchanged equally dismal expected year survival rate lung although hidden number improved survival many early still translate significant morbidity early mortality many although prevention key optimize care lung also paramount cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program show effective treat chronic heart lung among illness regardless prerehabilitation function morbidity mortality hinge directly,c,Lung Cancer

"Distinctive gene expression of human lung adenocarcinomas carrying LKB1 mutations LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1.","distinctive gene expression of human lung adenocarcinomas carrying lkb1 mutations lkb1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the peutz-jeghers syndrome (pjs), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. regarding tumors arising in non-pjs patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (lads) harbor somatic lkb1 gene mutations, supporting a role for lkb1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. to characterize the pattern of lkb1 mutations in lads further, we first screened for lkb1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 lads and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. recent reports demonstrate that lkb1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the",distinctive gene expression human lung adenocarcinoma carry lkb mutation lkb suppressor gene codify serine threonine kinase mutate germ line affect peutz jeghers syndrome pjs increase incidence several include gastrointestinal pancreatic lung carcinoma regard arise non pjs recently observe least one third lung adenocarcinoma lads harbor somatic lkb gene mutation support role lkb origin sporadic characterize pattern lkb mutation lad far first screen lkb gene alteration gene mutation promoter hypermethylation homozygous deletion lad agreement previous data five show harbor mutation give rise truncate protein recent report demonstrate lkb able suppress cell growth little know,c,Lung Cancer
"Extracellular vesicle-associated microRNA-221-3p secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells targets HMBOX1 to promote the progression of lung cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have received increasing attention for their role as possible regulators of cancer. miR-221-3p is a microRNA (miR) up-regulated in EVs secreted by drug-resistant A549-GR lung cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism through which miR-221-3p-containing EVs regulate the progression of lung cancer remains elusive. Here, we attempted to reveal the mechanism by which miR-221-3p-containing EVs secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells regulate the functions of surrounding cells during the progression of lung cancer. A gemcitabine-sensitive lung cancer cell line was treated with isolated drug-resistant lung cancer EVs followed by an evaluation of the proliferation and migration of sensitive lung cancer cell lines and their resistance to gemcitabine treatment. Moreover, the miR-221-3p target gene HMBOX1 was identified by the Targetscan database while the progression of lung cancer was detected by knocking down miR-221-3p or overexpressing HMBOX1, or by treating sensitive cell lines with Akt/mTOR activator and inhibitor, respectively. Furthermore, an in vivo study was performed to validate the relationship between miR-221-3p and HMBOX1 and their roles in the progression of lung cancer. The proliferation and migration of sensitive lung cancer cell lines and their resistance to drugs were significantly enhanced after the treatment with drug-resistant EVs. Knockdown of miR-221-3p (in the EV of drug-resistant lung cancer or overexpression of HMBOX1 in sensitive lung cancer cell lines) reduced the transformation of sensitive lung cell lines, whereas, the treatment of sensitive lung cell lines with Akt/mTOR activator or inhibitor significantly affected the progression of lung cancer. In vivo experiments further confirmed that miR-221-3p released by drug-resistant lung cancer cells targeted the HMBOX1 to regulate the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and affected the progression of lung cancer. We conclude that miR-221-3p-containing EVs secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells can potentially activate the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by inhibiting HMBOX1, promoting the progression of lung cancer. The regulation of miR-221-3p represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer.","extracellular vesicle-associated microrna-221-3p secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells targets hmbox1 to promote the progression of lung cancer. extracellular vesicles (evs) have received increasing attention for their role as possible regulators of cancer. mir-221-3p is a microrna (mir) up-regulated in evs secreted by drug-resistant a549-gr lung cancer cells. however, the underlying mechanism through which mir-221-3p-containing evs regulate the progression of lung cancer remains elusive. here, we attempted to reveal the mechanism by which mir-221-3p-containing evs secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells regulate the functions of surrounding cells during the progression of lung cancer. a gemcitabine-sensitive lung cancer cell line was treated with isolated drug-resistant lung cancer evs followed by an evaluation of the proliferation and migration of sensitive lung cancer cell lines and their resistance to gemcitabine treatment. moreover, the mir-221-3p target gene hmbox1 was identified by the targetscan database while the progression of lung cancer was detected by knocking",extracellular vesicle associate microrna p secrete drug resistant lung cell target hmbox promote progression lung extracellular vesicle evs receive increase attention role possible regulator mir p microrna mir regulate ev secrete drug resistant gr lung cell however underlying mechanism mir p contain evs regulate progression lung remain elusive attempt reveal mechanism mir p contain ev secrete drug resistant lung cell regulate function surround cell progression lung gemcitabine sensitive lung cell line treat isolated drug resistant lung ev follow evaluation proliferation migration sensitive lung cell line resistance gemcitabine moreover mir p target gene hmbox identify targetscan database progression lung detect knock,c,Lung Cancer
"Comparison of interleukin-12 with lung cancer and malignant lymphoma undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Purpose: High-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has become an important treatment for solid tumors including lung cancer. Methods: We measured IL-12 levels in patients with lung cancer undergoing autologous PBSCT in order to elucidate the role of IL-12 in immune response recovery following stem cell transplantation. Results: Compared to IL-12 levels at 1 week after PBSCT for lung cancer patients, those at 3 weeks were significantly increased (P<0.01). In contrast, serum IL-12 levels in malignant lymphoma patients did not change significantly. There were no significant differences in levels of other cytokines between 1 week and 3 weeks after transplantation in patients with lung cancer. The frequency of helper/inducer T cells was increased in peripheral blood 1 week after transplantation in both lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. There was a significant increase in activated T cell numbers following PBSCT. Furthermore, high levels of other activated T cells persisted in the post-PBSCT period in patients with lung cancer and the number of cytotoxic T cells significantly increased. Natural killer (NK) cell numbers also tended to increase, although that of malignant lymphoma was not significant. A strong correlation was observed between serum IL-12 levels and NK cell numbers and interferon-γ levels in lung cancer not but in malignant lymphoma patients. The analysis of transfused PBSC showed that the numbers of granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units were similar in lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. However, the number of CD34+ cells was significantly higher in lung cancer than in malignant lymphoma patients. All of the CD34+ subpopulations were lower in percentage in patients with lung cancer than in patients with malignant lymphoma. In particular, the CD34+ CD33– subpopulation was significantly lower in percentage in lung cancer patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PBSC in lung cancer are potent mediators of anticancer activity and that they might play an immunotherapeutic role against autologous malignant cells.","comparison of interleukin-12 with lung cancer and malignant lymphoma undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. purpose: high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (pbsct) has become an important treatment for solid tumors including lung cancer. methods: we measured il-12 levels in patients with lung cancer undergoing autologous pbsct in order to elucidate the role of il-12 in immune response recovery following stem cell transplantation. results: compared to il-12 levels at 1 week after pbsct for lung cancer patients, those at 3 weeks were significantly increased (p<0.01). in contrast, serum il-12 levels in malignant lymphoma patients did not change significantly. there were no significant differences in levels of other cytokines between 1 week and 3 weeks after transplantation in patients with lung cancer. the frequency of helper/inducer t cells was increased in peripheral blood 1 week after transplantation in both lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. there was a",comparison interleukin lung malignant lymphoma undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation high dose chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell transplantation pbsct become important solid include lung method measure il level lung undergo autologous pbsct order elucidate role il immune response recovery follow stem cell transplantation result compare il level week pbsct lung week significantly increase p contrast serum il level malignant lymphoma change significantly significant difference level cytokine week week transplantation lung frequency helper inducer cell increase peripheral blood week transplantation lung malignant lymphoma,c,Lung Cancer
"The effect of anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments in lung cancer patients with active tuberculosis: a retrospective analysis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments in lung cancer patients with active lung TB. In a retrospective cohort study, lung cancer patients with active lung TB were identified between January 2013 and December 2016. Age- and sex-matched lung cancer patients without tuberculosis were selected as control subjects. Anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments were administered according to the national guidelines. The clinical courses and responses of lung cancer patients with and without active lung TB were examined and compared. A total of 31 consecutive lung cancer patients were diagnosed with active lung TB. Fifty-one lung cancer patients without TB were enrolled as control subjects. Most patients in the two groups were elderly, had advanced non-small cell lung cancer and had tumor burdens. The anti-cancer treatment completion rate and response rate were not different between two group (87.1% in TB treatment patients vs. 92.2% in lung cancer patients, 77.4% in TB treatment patients vs. 88.2% in lung cancer patients, respectively).

"Optimum diameter threshold for lung nodules at baseline lung cancer screening with low-dose chest CT: exploration of results from the Korean Lung Cancer Screening Project To explore the optimum diameter threshold for solid nodules to define positive results at baseline screening low-dose CT (LDCT) and to compare two-dimensional and volumetric measurement of lung nodules for the diagnosis of lung cancers. We included consecutive participants from the Korean Lung Cancer Screening project between 2017 and 2018. The average transverse diameter and effective diameter (diameter of a sphere with the same volume) of lung nodules were measured by semi-automated segmentation. Diagnostic performances for lung cancers diagnosed within 1 year after LDCT were evaluated using area under receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities, and specificities, with diameter thresholds for solid nodules ranging from 6 to 10 mm. The reduction of unnecessary follow-up LDCTs and the diagnostic delay of lung cancers were estimated for each threshold. Fifty-two lung cancers were diagnosed among 10,424 (10,141 men; median age 62 years) participants within 1 year after LDCT. Average transverse (0.980) and effective diameters (0.981) showed similar AUCs (p = .739). Elevating the average transverse diameter threshold from 6 to 9 mm resulted in a significantly increased specificity (91.7 to 96.7%, p < .001), a modest reduction in sensitivity (96.2 to 94.2%, p = .317), a 60.2% estimated reduction of unnecessary follow-up LDCTs, and a diagnostic delay in 1.9% of lung cancers. Elevating the threshold to 10 mm led to a significant reduction in sensitivity (86.5%, p = .025). Elevating the diameter threshold for solid nodules from 6 to 9 mm may lead to a substantial reduction in unnecessary follow-up LDCTs with a small proportion of diagnostic delay of lung cancers. • Elevation of the diameter threshold for solid nodules from 6 to 9 mm can substantially reduce unnecessary follow-up LDCTs with a small proportion of diagnostic delay of lung cancers.;  • The average transverse and effective diameters of lung nodules showed similar performances for the prediction of a lung cancer diagnosis.","optimum diameter threshold for lung nodules at baseline lung cancer screening with low-dose chest ct: exploration of results from the korean lung cancer screening project to explore the optimum diameter threshold for solid nodules to define positive results at baseline screening low-dose ct (ldct) and to compare two-dimensional and volumetric measurement of lung nodules for the diagnosis of lung cancers. we included consecutive participants from the korean lung cancer screening project between 2017 and 2018. the average transverse diameter and effective diameter (diameter of a sphere with the same volume) of lung nodules were measured by semi-automated segmentation. diagnostic performances for lung cancers diagnosed within 1 year after ldct were evaluated using area under receiver-operating characteristic curves (aucs), sensitivities, and specificities, with diameter thresholds for solid nodules ranging from 6 to 10 mm. the reduction of unnecessary follow-up ldcts and the diagnostic delay of lung cancers were estimated for each",optimum diameter threshold lung nodule baseline lung screen low dose chest ct exploration result korean lung screen project explore optimum diameter threshold solid nodule define positive result baseline screen low dose ct ldct compare two dimensional volumetric measurement lung nodule diagnosis lung include consecutive participant korean lung screen project average transverse diameter effective diameter diameter sphere volume lung nodule measure semi automate segmentation diagnostic performance lung diagnose within year ldct evaluate use area receiver operating characteristic curve aucs sensitivity specificity diameter threshold solid nodule range mm reduction unnecessary follow ldcts diagnostic delay lung estimate,c,Lung Cancer
"The role of general practice in routes to diagnosis of lung cancer in Denmark: a population-based study of general practice involvement, diagnostic activity and diagnostic intervals Lung cancer stage at diagnosis predicts possible curative treatment. In Denmark and the UK, lung cancer patients have lower survival rates than citizens in most other European countries, which may partly be explained by a comparatively longer diagnostic interval in these two countries. In Denmark, a pathway was introduced in 2008 allowing general practitioners (GPs) to refer patients suspected of having lung cancer directly to fast-track diagnostics. However, symptom presentation of lung cancer in general practice is known to be diverse and complex, and systematic knowledge of the routes to diagnosis is needed to enable earlier lung cancer diagnosis in Denmark. This study aims to describe the routes to diagnosis, the diagnostic activity preceding diagnosis and the diagnostic intervals for lung cancer in the Danish setting. We conducted a national registry-based cohort study on 971 consecutive incident lung cancer patients in 2010 using data from national registries and GP questionnaires. GPs were involved in 68.3% of cancer patients’ diagnostic pathways, and 27.4% of lung cancer patients were referred from the GP to fast-track diagnostic work-up. A minimum of one X-ray was performed in 85.6% of all cases before diagnosis. Patients referred through a fast-track route more often had diagnostic X-rays (66.0%) than patients who did not go through fast-track (49.4%). Overall, 33.6% of all patients had two or more X-rays performed during the 90 days before diagnosis. Patients whose symptoms were interpreted as non-alarm symptoms or who were not referred to fast-track were more likely to experience a long diagnostic interval than patients whose symptoms were interpreted as alarm symptoms or who were referred to fast-track. Lung cancer patients followed several diagnostic pathways. The existing fast-track pathway must be supplemented to ensure earlier detection of lung cancer. The high incidence of multiple X-rays warrants a continued effort to develop more accurate lung cancer tests for use in primary care.","the role of general practice in routes to diagnosis of lung cancer in denmark: a population-based study of general practice involvement, diagnostic activity and diagnostic intervals lung cancer stage at diagnosis predicts possible curative treatment. in denmark and the uk, lung cancer patients have lower survival rates than citizens in most other european countries, which may partly be explained by a comparatively longer diagnostic interval in these two countries. in denmark, a pathway was introduced in 2008 allowing general practitioners (gps) to refer patients suspected of having lung cancer directly to fast-track diagnostics. however, symptom presentation of lung cancer in general practice is known to be diverse and complex, and systematic knowledge of the routes to diagnosis is needed to enable earlier lung cancer diagnosis in denmark. this study aims to describe the routes to diagnosis, the diagnostic activity preceding diagnosis and the diagnostic intervals for lung cancer in the",role general practice route diagnosis lung denmark population base general practice involvement diagnostic activity diagnostic interval lung stage diagnosis predicts possible curative denmark uk lung low survival rate citizen european country may partly explain comparatively longer diagnostic interval two country denmark pathway introduce allow general practitioner gps refer suspect lung directly fast track diagnostics however symptom presentation lung general practice know diverse complex systematic knowledge route diagnosis need enable early lung diagnosis denmark describe route diagnosis diagnostic activity precede diagnosis diagnostic interval lung,c,Lung Cancer

Functional experiments revealed that LARRPM suppressed LUAD cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. LARRPM also repressed macrophage M2 polarization and infiltration. Taken together, LARRPM significantly restricted LUAD progression in vivo. Mechanistically, LARRPM bound and recruited DNA demethylase TET1 to the promoter of its anti-sense strand gene LINC00240, leading to a decrease in DNA methylation level of the LINC00240 promoter and transcriptional activation of LINC00240. Functional rescue assays suggested that the lncRNA LINC00240 was responsible for the roles of LARRPM in the malignant behavior of LUAD cells. LARRPM decreased the binding of TET1 to the CSF1 promoter, resulting in increased DNA methylation of the CSF1 promoter and transcriptional repression of CSF1, which is responsible for the roles of LARRPM in macrophage M2 polarization and infiltration.

"Clinical and radiographic differentiation of lung nodules caused by mycobacteria and lung cancer: a case–control study Lung nodules caused by mycobacteria can resemble lung cancer on chest imaging. The advent of lung cancer screening with low-dose Computed Tomography is accompanied by high false-positive rates, making it necessary to establish criteria to differentiate malignant from benign nodules. We conducted a retrospective case–control study of 52 patients with mycobacterial lung nodules and 139 patients with lung cancer, diagnosed between 2010 and 2012. We compared clinical and radiographic characteristics to identify predictors of disease by univariate and multivariate analysis. The discriminatory power of maximum Standardized Uptake Values from Positron-Emission-Tomography was also evaluated. Several variables were correlated with a diagnosis of mycobacterial infection or lung cancer on univariate analysis. Such variable include smoking status and history, lesion size and imaging evidence of tree-in-bud opacities, lymphadenopathy or emphysema on computed tomography. Upon author consensus, the most clinically-relevant variables were selected to undergo multivariate analysis. A history of current or former smoking [OR 4.4 (95 % CI 1.2–15.6) and 2.7 (95 % CI 1.1–6.8), respectively P = 0.04] was correlated with diagnoses of lung cancer. Contrarily, the presence of tree-in-bud opacities was less likely to be correlated with a diagnosis of malignancy [OR 0.04 (95 % CI 0.0–1.0), P = 0.05]. Additionally, higher maximum standardized uptake values from positron emission tomography were associated with malignancy on multivariate analysis [OR 1.1 (95 % CI 1.0–1.2), P = 0.04]; but the accuracy of the values in differentiating between diseases was only 0.67 as measured by the area under the curve.

Establishing the likelihood of malignancy for lung nodules based on isolated clinical or radiographic criteria is difficult.

"Lung cancer incidence and mortality in relationship to hormone replacement therapy use among women participating in the PLCO trial: a post hoc analysis To evaluate the impact of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the incidence and mortality of lung cancer among female participants in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovary (PLCO) trial. All women participating in the PLCO trial with complete information about HRT exposure were included in the current analysis. All study population were aged 55–74 years without prior history of lung cancer at the time of study enrollment. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of HRT exposure on lung cancer incidence and mortality. For both end points, the model was adjusted for: age, body mass index, study arm, race, cigarette smoking and family history of lung cancer. A total of 77,911 female participants were included in the current analysis, including 27,663 participants who never used HRT before inclusion into the PLCO trial and 50,248 participants who used some form of HRT before inclusion into the PLCO trial. Prior exposure to HRT seems to be protective against the development of lung cancer in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for ever exposure versus never exposure 0.876; 95% CI 0.783–0.981; P = 0.022). Similarly, prior exposure to HRT seems also to be protective against death from lung cancer in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for ever exposure versus never exposure 0.814; 0.709–0.934; P = 0.003). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that current HRT usage at the time of PLCO trial entry (and not former HRT usage) seemed to be protective against lung cancer development (hazard ratio for current versus never users 0.842; 0.743–0.954; P = 0.007) and lung cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio for current versus never users 0.800; 0.686–0.932; P = 0.004). HRT use at the time of PLCO trial entry seems to be associated with lower probability of lung cancer development and death.

"Cancer Burden Variations and Convergences in Globalization: A Comparative Study on the Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung (TBL) and Liver Cancer Burdens Among WHO Regions from 1990 to 2019. Lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, respectively. Both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. A thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, especially the convergences and variations among WHO regions, is useful in precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) database were analyzed to evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer and liver cancer. Western Pacific Region (WPR) had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] per 100,000 population) and TBL cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000 population) in 2019. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for liver and TBL cancer elevated with the increasing sociodemographic index (SDI) level, except for liver cancer in WPR and TBL cancer in European Region (EUR). Region of the Americas (AMR) showed the biggest upward trends of liver cancer age-standardized rates (ASRs), as well as the biggest downward trends of TBL cancer ASRs, followed by Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Alcohol use and smoking were the leading cause of liver and TBL cancer death in most WHO regions. Variances of ASRs for liver and TBL cancer among WHO memberships have been decreasing during the past decade. The homogenization and convergence of cancer burdens were also demonstrated in different agegroups and sexes and in the evolution of associated risk factors and etiology. In conclusion, our study reflects the variations and convergences in the liver and lung cancer burdens among the WHO regions with the developing globalization, which suggests that we need to be acutely aware of the global homogeneity of the disease burden that accompanies increasing globalization, including the global convergences in various populations, risk factors, and burden metrics.","cancer burden variations and convergences in globalization: a comparative study on the tracheal, bronchus, and lung (tbl) and liver cancer burdens among who regions from 1990 to 2019. lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, respectively. both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. a thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, especially the convergences and variations among who regions, is useful in precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. the global burden of disease (gbd) and who global health observatory (gho) database were analyzed to evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung (tbl) cancer and liver cancer. western pacific region (wpr) had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (asir) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] per 100,000 population) and tbl cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000",burden variation convergence globalization comparative tracheal bronchus lung tbl liver burden among region lung liver leading third cause death respectively lung liver clear major risk factor thorough understanding burden context globalization especially convergence variation among region useful precision prevention worldwide understand change epidemiological trend expand globalization global burden gbd global health observatory gho database analyze evaluate burden metric risk factor trachea bronchus lung tbl liver western pacific region wpr high age standardize incidence rate asir liver per population tbl per,c,Lung Cancer
"Nomogram based on homogeneous and heterogeneous associated factors for predicting bone metastases in patients with different histological types of lung cancer. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the prevalence, associated factors, and to construct a nomogram for predicting bone metastasis (BM) with different histological types of lung cancer. This study was a descriptive study that basing on the invasive lung cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. A total of 125,652 adult patients were retrieved. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate homogeneous and heterogeneous factors for BM occurrence. Nomogram was constructed to predict the risk for developing BM and the performance was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and the calibration curve. The overall survival of the patients with BM was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and the survival differences were tested by the log-rank test. A total of 25,645 (20.9%) were reported to have BM, and the prevalence in adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), large cell lung cancer (LCLC), and non-small cell lung cancer/not otherwise specified lung cancer (NSCLC/NOS) were 24.4, 12.5, 24.7, 19.5 and 19.4%, respectively, with significant difference (P < 0.001). Male gender, more metastatic sites and lymphatic metastasis were positively associated with BM in all lung cancer subtypes. Larger tumor size was positively associated with BM in all the lung cancer subtypes except for NSCLC/NOS. Poorly differentiated histology was positively associated with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and NSCLC/NOS. The calibration curve and ROC curve exhibited good performance for predicting BM. The median survival of the bone metastatic lung cancer patients was 4.00 (95%CI: 3.89–4.11) months. With the increased number of the other metastatic sites (brain, lung and liver metastasis), the survival significantly decreased (p < 0.001).

"Therapy with un-engineered naïve rat umbilical cord matrix stem cells markedly inhibits growth of murine lung adenocarcinoma Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite continuous efforts to find effective treatments. Data from the American Cancer Society indicate that while the overall incidence of lung cancer is declining, it continues to rise in women. Stem cell-based therapy has been an emerging strategy to treat various diseases. The purpose of this paper is to determine the efficacy of an intrinsic anti-cancer effect of rat umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) on lung cancer. A mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma model was used to test the basic ability of UCMSCs to control the growth of lung cancer. Lung tumors were experimentally induced by tail vein administration of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells derived from the lung of C57BL/6 mouse. Rat UCMSCs were then administered intratracheally five days later or intravenously on days 5 and 7. The tumor burdens were determined by measuring lung weight three weeks after the treatment. Co-culture of rat UCMSCs with LLC significantly attenuated the proliferation of LLC cells as monitored by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), a tetrazole cell proliferation assay, thymidine uptake, and direct cell counts. In vitro colony assays with rat UCMSCs as feeder layers markedly reduced LLC colony size and number. Co-culture of rat UCMSCs with LLCs causes G0/G1 arrest of cancer cells. This is evident in the decrease of cyclin A and CDK2 expression. The in vivo studies showed that rat UCMSC treatment significantly decreased tumor weight and the total tumor mass. Histological study revealed that intratracheally or systemically administered rat UCMSCs homed to tumor areas and survived for at least 3 weeks without any evidence of differentiation or adverse effects. These results indicate that rat UCMSCs alone remarkably attenuate the growth of lung carcinoma cells in vitro and in a mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma graft model and could be used for targeted cytotherapy for lung cancer.","therapy with un-engineered naïve rat umbilical cord matrix stem cells markedly inhibits growth of murine lung adenocarcinoma lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite continuous efforts to find effective treatments. data from the american cancer society indicate that while the overall incidence of lung cancer is declining, it continues to rise in women. stem cell-based therapy has been an emerging strategy to treat various diseases. the purpose of this paper is to determine the efficacy of an intrinsic anti-cancer effect of rat umbilical cord matrix stem cells (ucmscs) on lung cancer. a mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma model was used to test the basic ability of ucmscs to control the growth of lung cancer. lung tumors were experimentally induced by tail vein administration of lewis lung carcinoma (llc) cells derived from the lung of c57bl/6 mouse. rat ucmscs were then administered intratracheally five days later or intravenously on",therapy un engineer na rat umbilical cord matrix stem cell markedly inhibit growth murine lung adenocarcinoma lung remain lead cause relate mortality despite continuous effort find effective data american society indicate overall incidence lung decline continue rise woman stem cell base therapy emerge strategy treat various paper determine efficacy intrinsic anti effect rat umbilical cord matrix stem cell ucmscs lung mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma model use test basic ability ucmscs control growth lung lung experimentally induce tail vein administration lewis lung carcinoma llc cell derive lung c bl mouse rat ucmscs administer intratracheally five day later intravenously,c,Lung Cancer
"The blood-borne miRNA signature of lung cancer patients is independent of histology but influenced by metastases Objectives: In our previous studies we reported a panel of 24 miRNAs that allowed discrimination between blood of lung tumor patients independent of the histological subtype and blood of healthy controls with an accuracy of 95.4% [94.9%-95.9%]. Here, we now separately analyzed the miRNA expression in blood of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Patients and methods: In total, we examined the expression levels of 1,205 miRNAs in blood samples from 20 patients from each of the three histological groups and determined differentially expressed miRNAs between histological subtypes and metastatic and non-metastatic lung cancer. We further determined the overlap of miRNAs expressed in each subgroup with the 24-miRNA signature of lung tumor patients. Results: Based on a raw p-value<0.05, only 18 blood-borne miRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with adenocarcinoma and with squamous cell lung carcinoma, 11 miRNAs between adenocarcinoma and SCLC, and 2 between squamous cell lung carcinoma and SCLC. Likewise, the comparison based on a fold change of 1.5 did not reveal major differences of the blood-borne miRNA expression pattern between NSCLC and SCLC. In addition, we found a large overlap between the blood-borne miRNAs detected in the three histological subgroups and the previously described 24-miRNA signature that separates lung cancer patients form controls. We identified several miRNAs that allowed differentiating between metastatic and non-metastatic tumors both in blood of patients with adenocarcinoma and in blood of patients with SCLC. Conclusion: There is a common miRNA expression pattern in blood of lung cancer patients that does not allow a reliable further subtyping into NSCLC or SCLC, or into adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer. The previously described 24-miRNA signature for lung cancer appears not primarily dependent on histological subtypes. However, metastatic adenocarcinoma and SCLC can be predicted with 75% accuracy.","the blood-borne mirna signature of lung cancer patients is independent of histology but influenced by metastases objectives: in our previous studies we reported a panel of 24 mirnas that allowed discrimination between blood of lung tumor patients independent of the histological subtype and blood of healthy controls with an accuracy of 95.4% [94.9%-95.9%]. here, we now separately analyzed the mirna expression in blood of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma, and small cell lung cancer (sclc) patients. patients and methods: in total, we examined the expression levels of 1,205 mirnas in blood samples from 20 patients from each of the three histological groups and determined differentially expressed mirnas between histological subtypes and metastatic and non-metastatic lung cancer. we further determined the overlap of mirnas expressed in each subgroup with the 24-mirna signature of lung tumor patients. results: based on a raw p-value<0.05, only 18",blood borne mirna signature lung independent histology influence metastasis previous report panel mirnas allow discrimination blood lung independent histological subtype blood healthy control accuracy separately analyze mirna expression blood non small cell lung nsclc include squamous cell lung adenocarcinoma small cell lung sclc method total examine expression level mirnas blood sample three histological group determine differentially express mirnas histological subtypes metastatic non metastatic lung determine overlap mirnas express subgroup mirna signature lung result base raw p value,c,Lung Cancer

"PDZRN4 suppresses lung adenocarcinoma progression via inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated HIF-1A degradation. Indolent lung cancer is characterized by slow progression, and the patient may die of other causes before it becomes symptomatic. The increasing usage of lung cancer screening technologies has increased the detection of early-stage cancers, improved survival, and reduced mortality, but it also brings overdiagnosis or overtreatment for indolent lung cancer patients. In this study, we performed high-throughput whole-exome sequencing in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with a tumor doubling time of more than 600 days (the indolent group) and another group with a tumor doubling time of less than 30 days (the aggressive group). We identified a novel germline variation in PDZRN4, rs74955204 (p.G121E, c.362 G > A) in the indolent group. The rs74955204 variant resulted in upregulated PDZRN4 expression and was positively correlated with the survival of LUAD patients. We confirmed that overexpression of PDZRN4 inhibits the ubiquitylation of HIF-1A mediated by TRIM28, thus activating HIF-1A-IGFBP3 signaling to promote apoptosis, and inducing NDRG1 to inhibit EGFR-AKT signaling, restricting lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. With the EGFR<sup>L858R</sup>-driven lung cancer mouse model as an example, we found that PDZRN4 knockout promoted, whereas PDZRN4 overexpression suppressed LUAD growth in vivo. In addition, recombinant PDZRN4 or screened small molecules retinoic acid showed potent inhibitory effects on EGFR-driven LUAD growth and amelioration of osimertinib resistance. Overall, our findings suggest that targeted PDZRN4 is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating LUAD. Examination of PDZRN4 rs74955204 variant may be an effective approach for the early detection of indolent lung cancer and to avoid overdiagnosis. Graphical Abstract: Germline variation rs74955204 (p.G121E, c.362 G > A) in PDZRN4 significantly upregulated PDZRN4 expression and resulted in indolent growth of LUAD.

"Artificial neural networks improve LDCT lung cancer screening: a comparative validation study. This study proposes a prediction model for the automatic assessment of lung cancer risk based on an artificial neural network (ANN) with a data-driven approach to the low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) standardized structure report. This comparative validation study analysed a prospective cohort from Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. In total, 836 asymptomatic patients who had undergone LDCT scans between February 2017 and August 2018 were included, comprising 27 lung cancer cases and 809 controls. A derivation cohort of 602 participants (19 lung cancer cases and 583 controls) was collected to construct the ANN prediction model. A comparative validation of the ANN and Lung-RADS was conducted with a prospective cohort of 234 participants (8 lung cancer cases and 226 controls). The areas under the curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the prediction models. At the cut-off of category 3, the Lung-RADS had a sensitivity of 12.5%, specificity of 96.0%, positive predictive value of 10.0%, and negative predictive value of 96.9%. At its optimal cut-off value, the ANN had a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 85.0%, positive predictive value of 15.0%, and negative predictive value of 99.0%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.764 for the Lung-RADS and 0.873 for the ANN (P = 0.01). The two most important predictors used by the ANN for predicting lung cancer were the documented sizes of partially solid nodules and ground-glass nodules. Compared to the Lung-RADS, the ANN provided better sensitivity for the detection of lung cancer in an Asian population. In addition, the ANN provided a more refined discriminative ability than the Lung-RADS for lung cancer risk stratification with population-specific demographic characteristics. When lung nodules are detected and documented in a standardized structured report, ANNs may better provide important insights for lung cancer prediction than conventional rule-based criteria.","artificial neural networks improve ldct lung cancer screening: a comparative validation study. this study proposes a prediction model for the automatic assessment of lung cancer risk based on an artificial neural network (ann) with a data-driven approach to the low-dose computed tomography (ldct) standardized structure report. this comparative validation study analysed a prospective cohort from chiayi chang gung memorial hospital, taiwan. in total, 836 asymptomatic patients who had undergone ldct scans between february 2017 and august 2018 were included, comprising 27 lung cancer cases and 809 controls. a derivation cohort of 602 participants (19 lung cancer cases and 583 controls) was collected to construct the ann prediction model. a comparative validation of the ann and lung-rads was conducted with a prospective cohort of 234 participants (8 lung cancer cases and 226 controls). the areas under the curves (aucs) of the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were used to compare the",artificial neural network improve ldct lung screen comparative validation propose prediction model automatic assessment lung risk base artificial neural network ann data driven approach low dose compute tomography ldct standardized structure report comparative validation analyse prospective cohort chiayi chang gung memorial hospital taiwan total asymptomatic undergone ldct scan february august include comprise lung control derivation cohort participant lung control collect construct ann prediction model comparative validation ann lung rad conduct prospective cohort participant lung control area curve auc receiver operate characteristic roc curve use compare,c,Lung Cancer
"Current evidence on the relationship between CYP1B1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk: a meta-analysis The association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CYP1B1 gene and lung cancer risk is still ambiguous. In this meta analysis, we assessed 10 case-control studies included 7,067 cases and 9,374 controls of the association between CYP1B1 SNPs of Leu432Val (rs1056836, 432C>G), Asn453Ser (rs1800440, 453A>G), Ala119Ser (rs1056827, 119G>T), Arg48Gly (rs10012, 48C>G) and the risk of lung cancer. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association between the polymorphism and lung cancer risk under codominant model, dominant model and additive model respectively. Although there were limitations, this meta analysis indicated that individuals with 432GG genotype had a 39.7% higher risk of having lung cancer than those with the 432CC genotype, and individuals with the 432G allele had a 26.3% increased risk as well. An increased risk of lung cancer of 2.13 fold was observed in individuals with 119TT genotype. For Arg48Gly, individuals with 48GG genotype had a significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with individuals with 48CC (OR 3.859; 95% CI 2.536-5.87). Elevated risk of lung cancer were observed in dominant model (OR 2.115; 95% CI 1.653-2.705) as well. The risk of lung cancer was elevated as the frequency of G allele increased in additive model (P = 0.000). For individuals with the polymorphism at codon 453, no evidence of such association was observed. Furthermore, a possible association between the CYP1B1 polymorphism at codon 432 and the lung cancer could be detected in individuals of Caucasian origin, while a negative association was suggested in Asians and African-Americans. An increased lung cancer risk was also found in women with polymorphism at codon 453. These results are supportive for the hypothesis that the CYP1B1 432GG, 119TT and 48GG genotypes are low-penetrance risk factors for developing lung cancer, and further studies are needed to validate these associations.","current evidence on the relationship between cyp1b1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk: a meta-analysis the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of the cyp1b1 gene and lung cancer risk is still ambiguous. in this meta analysis, we assessed 10 case-control studies included 7,067 cases and 9,374 controls of the association between cyp1b1 snps of leu432val (rs1056836, 432c>g), asn453ser (rs1800440, 453a>g), ala119ser (rs1056827, 119g>t), arg48gly (rs10012, 48c>g) and the risk of lung cancer. crude odds ratios (ors) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were used to evaluate the strength of association between the polymorphism and lung cancer risk under codominant model, dominant model and additive model respectively. although there were limitations, this meta analysis indicated that individuals with 432gg genotype had a 39.7% higher risk of having lung cancer than those with the 432cc genotype, and individuals with the 432g allele had a 26.3% increased risk as well. an increased risk of lung",current evidence relationship cyp b polymorphism lung risk meta association single nucleotide polymorphism snp cyp b gene lung risk still ambiguous meta assess control include control association cyp b snp leu val r c g asn ser r g ala ser r g arg gly rs c g risk lung crude odds ratio confidence interval cis use evaluate strength association polymorphism lung risk codominant model dominant model additive model respectively although limitation meta indicate individual gg genotype high risk lung cc genotype individual g allele increase risk well increase risk lung,c,Lung Cancer
"SPECT/CT of lung nodules using 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) in a mouse lung carcinogenesis model Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, including Japan. Although computed tomography (CT) can detect small lung lesions such as those appearing as ground glass opacity, it cannot differentiate between malignant and non-malignant lesions. Previously, we have shown that single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using 111In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N′′,N′′′-tetraacetic acid-cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (DOTA-c(RGDfK)), an imaging probe of αvβ3 integrin, is useful for the early detection of pancreatic cancer in a hamster pancreatic carcinogenesis model. In this study, we aimed to assess the usefulness of SPECT/CT with 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) for the evaluation of the malignancy of lung cancer. Lung tumors were induced by a single intraperitoneal injection (250 mg/kg) of urethane in male A/J mice. Twenty-six weeks after the urethane treatment, SPECT was performed an hour after injection of 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK). Following this, the radioactivity ratios of tumor to normal lung tissue were measured by autoradiography (ARG) in the excised lung samples. We also examined the expression of αvβ3 integrin in mouse and human lung samples. Urethane treatment induced 5 hyperplasias, 41 adenomas and 12 adenocarcinomas in the lungs of 8 A/J mice. SPECT with 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) could clearly visualize lung nodules, though we failed to detect small lung nodules like adenoma and hyperplasias (adenocarcinoma: 66.7 %, adenoma: 33.6 %, hyperplasia: 0.0 %). ARG analysis revealed significant uptake of 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) in all the lesions. Moreover, tumor to normal lung tissue ratios increased along with the progression of carcinogenesis. Histopathological examination using human lung tissue samples revealed clear up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (Noguchi type B and C) rather than atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Although there are some limitations in evaluating the malignancy of small lung tumors using 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK), SPECT with 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) might be a useful non-invasive imaging approach for evaluating the characteristics of lung tumors in mice, thus showing potential for use in humans.","spect/ct of lung nodules using 111in-dota-c(rgdfk) in a mouse lung carcinogenesis model lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, including japan. although computed tomography (ct) can detect small lung lesions such as those appearing as ground glass opacity, it cannot differentiate between malignant and non-malignant lesions. previously, we have shown that single photon emission computed tomography (spect) imaging using 111in-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-n,n′,n′′,n′′′-tetraacetic acid-cyclo-(arg-gly-asp-d-phe-lys) (dota-c(rgdfk)), an imaging probe of αvβ3 integrin, is useful for the early detection of pancreatic cancer in a hamster pancreatic carcinogenesis model. in this study, we aimed to assess the usefulness of spect/ct with 111in-dota-c(rgdfk) for the evaluation of the malignancy of lung cancer. lung tumors were induced by a single intraperitoneal injection (250 mg/kg) of urethane in male a/j mice. twenty-six weeks after the urethane treatment, spect was performed an hour after injection of 111in-dota-c(rgdfk). following this, the radioactivity ratios of tumor to",spect ct lung nodule use dota c rgdfk mouse lung carcinogenesis model lung one leading cause relate death worldwide include japan although compute tomography ct detect small lung lesion appear ground glass opacity cannot differentiate malignant non malignant lesion previously show single photon emission compute tomography spect image use tetraazacyclododecane n n n n tetraacetic acid cyclo arg gly asp phe lys dota c rgdfk image probe v integrin useful early detection pancreatic hamster pancreatic carcinogenesis model assess usefulness spect ct dota c rgdfk evaluation malignancy lung lung induce single intraperitoneal injection mg kg urethane male j mouse twenty six week urethane spect perform hour injection dota c rgdfk follow radioactivity ratio,c,Lung Cancer

"Metal concentrations in lung tissue of subjects suffering from lung cancer. Concentrations of nine metals (Fe, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb and Cr) concentrations in lung tissues from 224 lung cancer cases were compared with those in other cases to achieve an understanding of their contribution to the development of lung cancer and the varieties after the development of cancer. Comparisons of metal concentrations in each cell type of lung cancer were also performed. All cases were collected from routine autopsies in Tokyo and Saitama, Japan. The copper concentration in tissue from lung cancers was significantly higher than that in other specimens, although calcium, magnesium, zinc and cobalt concentrations in lung cancers were significantly lower than those in other cases. There were no significant differences in the 99% intervals (excluding extremely high values for occupationally exposed cases) for chromium, nickel and lead concentrations between lung cancers and other cases, although these values were lower in lung cancers. However, in comparisons of men only, the chromium concentration, the degree of lung contamination and the severity of pulmonary emphysema in lung cancer cases were significantly higher than those in other specimens. Moreover, percentages of lung cancer in men at each degree of contamination and each severity of emphysema increased with increasing grades. Thus, this finding could be evidence that the exposure to contaminants other than chromium and nickel in the air had affected the development of lung cancer, except for occupationally exposed individuals. Therefore, almost all chromium and nickel in lung tissue might not deposit in carcinogenic forms such as hexavalent chromium or nickel subsulfide. Comparison of the characteristics in each cell type of lung cancer revealed that calcium and chromium concentrations in lung tissue (not including tumor) or squamous cell carcinomas were higher than those in the other cell types. In small cell carcinomas, calcium magnesium and zinc concentrations were low.","metal concentrations in lung tissue of subjects suffering from lung cancer. concentrations of nine metals (fe, ca, mg, zn, cu, co, ni, pb and cr) concentrations in lung tissues from 224 lung cancer cases were compared with those in other cases to achieve an understanding of their contribution to the development of lung cancer and the varieties after the development of cancer. comparisons of metal concentrations in each cell type of lung cancer were also performed. all cases were collected from routine autopsies in tokyo and saitama, japan. the copper concentration in tissue from lung cancers was significantly higher than that in other specimens, although calcium, magnesium, zinc and cobalt concentrations in lung cancers were significantly lower than those in other cases. there were no significant differences in the 99% intervals (excluding extremely high values for occupationally exposed cases) for chromium, nickel and lead concentrations between lung cancers and other",metal concentration lung tissue subject suffer lung concentration nine metal fe ca mg zn cu co ni pb cr concentration lung tissue lung compare achieve understanding contribution development lung variety development comparison metal concentration cell type lung also perform collect routine autopsy tokyo saitama japan copper concentration tissue lung significantly high specimen although calcium magnesium zinc cobalt concentration lung significantly low significant difference interval exclude extremely high value occupationally expose chromium nickel lead concentration lung,c,Lung Cancer
"MicroRNA-218 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer by targeting IL-6/STAT3 and negatively correlates with poor prognosis Aberrant expression of microRNAs in different human cancer types has been widely reported. MiR-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in diverse human cancer types impacting regulation of multiple genes in oncogenic pathways. Here, we evaluated the expression and function of miR-218 in human lung cancer and ALDH positive lung cancer cells to understand the potential mechanisms responsible for disease pathology. Also, the association between its host genes and the target genes could be useful towards the better understanding of prognosis in clinical settings. Publicly-available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was mined to compare the levels of miR-218 and its host gene SLIT2/3 between lung cancer tissues and normal lung tissues. Transfection of miR-218 to investigate its function in lung cancer cells was done and in vivo effects were determined using miR-218 expressing lentiviruses. Aldefluor assay and Flow cytometry was used to quantify and enrich ALDH positive lung cancer cells. Levels of miR-218, IL-6R, JAK3 and phosphorylated STAT3 were compared in ALDH1A1 positive and ALDH1A1 negative cells. Overexpression of miR-218 in ALDH positive cells was carried to test the survival by tumorsphere culture. Finally, utilizing TCGA data we studied the association of target genes of miR-218 with the prognosis of lung cancer. We observed that the expression of miR-218 was significantly down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared to normal lung tissues. Overexpression of miR-218 decreased cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, and tumor sphere formation in vitro and repressed tumor growth in vivo. We further found that miR-218 negatively regulated IL-6 receptor and JAK3 gene expression by directly targeting the 3′-UTR of their mRNAs. In addition, the levels of both miR-218 host genes and the components of IL-6/STAT3 pathway correlated with prognosis of lung cancer patients.

"Benzyl isothiocyanate induces protective autophagy in human lung cancer cells through an endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated mechanism Isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocya¬nate (AITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothio¬cyanate (PEITC) and sulforaphane (SFN), are natural compounds abundant in cruciferous vegetables, which have substantial chemopreventive activities against various human malignancies. However, the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of tumor cell growth by isothiocyanates are not fully understood. Since autophagy has dual functions in cancer, in the present study we investigated the effects of BITC on autophagy induction in human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. BITC (1–100 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the growth of 3 different human lung cancer cell lines A549 (adenocarcinoma), H661 (large cell carcinoma) and SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma) with IC50 values of 30.7±0.14, 15.9±0.22 and 23.4±0.11 μmol/L, respectively. BITC (10–40 μmol/L) induced autophagy in the lung cancer cells, evidenced by the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs), the accumulation of LC3-II, the punctate pattern of LC3, and the expression of Atg5. Pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (5 mmol/L) significantly enhanced the BITC-caused growth inhibition in the lung cancer cells. Furthermore, BITC (20–40 μmol/L) activated ER stress, as shown by the increased cytosolic Ca2+ level and the phosphorylation of the ER stress marker proteins PERK and eIF2α in the lung cancer cells. Pretreatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA (5 mmol/L) attenuated the autophagy induction and potentiated the BITC-induced cell growth inhibition. In nude mice bearing A549 xenografts, administration of BITC (100 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) for 8 weeks markedly suppressed the lung tumor growth, and significantly enhanced both autophagy and ER stress in the tumor tissues. Our results demonstrate that BITC inhibits human lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, BITC induces autophagy in the lung cancer cells, which protects the cancer cells against the inhibitory action of BITC; the autophagy induction is mediated by the ER stress response.","benzyl isothiocyanate induces protective autophagy in human lung cancer cells through an endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated mechanism isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocya¬nate (aitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothio¬cyanate (peitc) and sulforaphane (sfn), are natural compounds abundant in cruciferous vegetables, which have substantial chemopreventive activities against various human malignancies. however, the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of tumor cell growth by isothiocyanates are not fully understood. since autophagy has dual functions in cancer, in the present study we investigated the effects of bitc on autophagy induction in human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. bitc (1–100 μmol/l) dose-dependently inhibited the growth of 3 different human lung cancer cell lines a549 (adenocarcinoma), h661 (large cell carcinoma) and sk-mes-1 (squamous cell carcinoma) with ic50 values of 30.7±0.14, 15.9±0.22 and 23.4±0.11 μmol/l, respectively. bitc (10–40 μmol/l) induced autophagy in the lung cancer cells, evidenced by the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (avos), the accumulation",benzyl isothiocyanate induces protective autophagy human lung cell endoplasmic reticulum stress mediate mechanism isothiocyanate allyl isothiocya nate aitc benzyl isothiocyanate bitc phenethyl isothio cyanate peitc sulforaphane sfn natural compound abundant cruciferous vegetable substantial chemopreventive activity various human malignancy however mechanism underlie inhibition cell growth isothiocyanate fully understood since autophagy dual function present investigate effect bitc autophagy induction human lung cell vitro vivo bitc mol l dose dependently inhibit growth different human lung cell line adenocarcinoma h large cell carcinoma sk squamous cell carcinoma ic value mol l respectively bitc mol l induce autophagy lung cell evidence formation acidic vesicular organelle avos accumulation,c,Lung Cancer
"Inhibition of ASAP1 Modulates the Tumor Immune Microenvironment and Suppresses Lung Cancer Metastasis via the p-STAT3 Signaling Pathway. ADP ribosylation factor guanylate kinase 1 (ASAP1), a key protein regulating cell migration and invasion, has attracted extensive attention in oncological research in recent years. This study aims to explore the effects of ASAP1 inhibition on lung cancer metastasis and its potential mechanisms, particularly how it modulates the tumor immune microenvironment through the p-STAT3 signaling pathway. In this study, shRNA technology was employed to specifically inhibit ASAP1 expression in lung cancer cell lines A549, NCI-H1299, and PC-9. The effects of ASAP1 inhibition on lung cancer cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were evaluated using CCK-8, TUNEL apoptosis detection, and cell migration and invasion assays. Furthermore, animal experiments were conducted to assess the in vivo effects of ASAP1 inhibition on lung cancer metastasis, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to investigate changes in immune cells in lung metastasis models, further exploring its impact on the tumor immune microenvironment. The experimental results demonstrated that ASAP1 inhibition significantly reduced lung cancer cell viability, induced apoptosis in A549, NCI-H1299, and PC-9 cells, and suppressed the migration and invasion abilities of these cells. In vivo experiments revealed that ASAP1 inhibition effectively suppressed lung cancer metastasis and altered the tumor immune microenvironment by regulating immune cells. Moreover, we found that ASAP1 inhibition could decrease tumor cell proliferation and induce tumor apoptosis in lung metastasis models by inhibiting the p-STAT3 signaling pathway. This study confirms that ASAP1 inhibition can suppress lung cancer metastasis by modulating the tumor immune microenvironment through the inhibition of the p-STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings provide new targets for lung cancer treatment and a theoretical basis for developing novel strategies against lung cancer metastasis. Future research will further explore the mechanisms of ASAP1 in lung cancer metastasis and how to optimize treatment strategies for lung cancer patients by targeting ASAP1.","inhibition of asap1 modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and suppresses lung cancer metastasis via the p-stat3 signaling pathway. adp ribosylation factor guanylate kinase 1 (asap1), a key protein regulating cell migration and invasion, has attracted extensive attention in oncological research in recent years. this study aims to explore the effects of asap1 inhibition on lung cancer metastasis and its potential mechanisms, particularly how it modulates the tumor immune microenvironment through the p-stat3 signaling pathway. in this study, shrna technology was employed to specifically inhibit asap1 expression in lung cancer cell lines a549, nci-h1299, and pc-9. the effects of asap1 inhibition on lung cancer cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were evaluated using cck-8, tunel apoptosis detection, and cell migration and invasion assays. furthermore, animal experiments were conducted to assess the in vivo effects of asap1 inhibition on lung cancer metastasis, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to investigate changes in immune",inhibition asap modulate immune microenvironment suppresses lung metastasis via p stat signal pathway adp ribosylation factor guanylate kinase asap key protein regulate cell migration invasion attract extensive attention oncological research recent year explore effect asap inhibition lung metastasis potential mechanism particularly modulate immune microenvironment p stat signal pathway shrna technology employ specifically inhibit asap expression lung cell line nci h pc effect asap inhibition lung cell viability apoptosis migration invasion evaluate use cck tunel apoptosis detection cell migration invasion assay furthermore animal experiment conduct assess vivo effect asap inhibition lung metastasis immunohistochemical perform investigate change immune,c,Lung Cancer
"Current lung cancer screening guidelines may miss high-risk population: a real-world study. Despite much research published on lung cancer screening, China has had no large-scale study on the missed diagnosis of lung cancer in a health examination population. We therefore did a real-world study using the current lung cancer screening guidelines to a health examination population in China to determine the proportion of lung cancer cases that have been missed. A real-world cohort study of screening, with the use of low-dose computed tomography, was conducted among people who took yearly health checkup in health management center of West China Hospital between 2006 and 2017. We respectively used current guidelines including lung cancer screening guidelines of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and expert consensus on low dose spiral CT lung cancer screening in China. In a total of 15,996 participants with health examination who completed the baseline screening, 6779 (42.4%) subjects had at least one positive finding, and 142 (2.1%) cases of lung cancer were screened positive. The false positive rate was 97.9%. Of 142 lung cancer cases detected in our study, only 9.2% met the lung cancer screening guidelines proposed by the USPSTF, and 24.4% met that of China. The rates of missed diagnosis were as high as 90.8 and 75.6% respectively. In addition, we did an in-depth analysis by gender. We found that among male patients with lung cancer, the proportion of smokers was 75%, and the proportion of young people under 50 was 23.2%. Among female patients with lung cancer, the proportion of smokers was only 5.8%, and the proportion of young people under 50 was up to 33.3%. The rate of missed diagnosis was as high as 90.8% applying the current lung cancer screening guidelines to the health examination population in China.

"Phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits metastasis potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells through FTO mediated TLE1 m6A modification. N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification is a prevalent RNA epigenetic modification, which plays a crucial role in tumor progression including metastasis. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are natural compounds and inhibit the tumorigenesis of various cancers. Our previous studies show that ITCs inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and have synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of ITCs on cancer cell metastasis. We showed that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) dose-dependently inhibited the cell viability of both NSCLC cell lines H1299 and H226 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 17.6 and 15.2 μM, respectively. Furthermore, PEITC dose-dependently inhibited the invasion and migration of H1299 and H226 cells. We demonstrated that PEITC treatment dose-dependently increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation levels and inhibited the expression of the m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in H1299 and H226 cells. Knockdown of FTO significantly increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in H1299 and H226 cells, impaired their abilities of invasion and migration in vitro, and enhanced the inhibition of PEITC on tumor growth in vivo. Overexpression of FTO promoted the migration of NSCLC cells, and also mitigated the inhibitory effect of PEITC on migration of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we found that FTO regulated the mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a transcriptional co-repressor Transducin-Like Enhancer of split-1 (TLE1) and further affected its stability and expression. TCGA database analysis revealed TLE1 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to normal tissues, which might be correlated with the metastasis status. Moreover, we showed that PEITC suppressed the migration of NSCLC cells by inhibiting TLE1 expression and downstream Akt/NF-κB pathway. This study reveals a novel mechanism underlying ITC's inhibitory effect on metastasis of lung cancer cells, and provided valuable information for developing new therapeutics for lung cancer by targeting m<sup>6</sup>A methylation.","phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits metastasis potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells through fto mediated tle1 m6a modification. n6-methyladenosine (m 6 a) modification is a prevalent rna epigenetic modification, which plays a crucial role in tumor progression including metastasis. isothiocyanates (itcs) are natural compounds and inhibit the tumorigenesis of various cancers. our previous studies show that itcs inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) cells, and have synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs. in this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of itcs on cancer cell metastasis. we showed that phenethyl isothiocyanate (peitc) dose-dependently inhibited the cell viability of both nsclc cell lines h1299 and h226 with ic 50 values of 17.6 and 15.2 μm, respectively. furthermore, peitc dose-dependently inhibited the invasion and migration of h1299 and h226 cells. we demonstrated that peitc treatment dose-dependently increased m 6 a methylation levels and inhibited the",phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits metastasis potential non small cell lung cell fto mediate tle modification n methyladenosine modification prevalent rna epigenetic modification play crucial role progression include metastasis isothiocyanate itcs natural compound inhibit tumorigenesis various previous show itcs inhibit proliferation metastasis non small cell lung nsclc cell synergistic effect chemotherapy drug investigate molecular mechanism underlie inhibitory effect itcs cell metastasis show phenethyl isothiocyanate peitc dose dependently inhibit cell viability nsclc cell line h h ic value respectively furthermore peitc dose dependently inhibit invasion migration h h cell demonstrate peitc dose dependently increase methylation level inhibit,c,Lung Cancer
"An immunohistochemical study of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC): a possible prognostic biomarker. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is an atypical CDK which plays a vital role in several cancers via regulating migration and motility of cancer cells. However, the clinicopathological impact and function of CDK5 in lung cancer remain poorly understood. The present study was aimed at exploring expression and clinicopathological significance of CDK5 in lung cancer. There were 395 samples of lung tissue including 365 lung tumors (339 non-small cell lung cancers and 26 small cell lung cancers) and 30 samples of normal lung. CDK5 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry on lung tissue microarrays. Over expression was detected in lung cancer compared with normal lung tissues (P = 0.001). Furthermore, area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of CDK5 was 0.685 (95 % CI 0.564~0.751, P = 0.004). In lung cancer, we also discovered close correlations between CDK5 and pathological grading (r = 0.310, P < 0.001), TNM stage (r = 0.155, P = 0.003), and lymph node metastasis (r = 0.279, P < 0.001) by using Spearman analysis. In two subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the expression of CDK5 was also higher than that of normal lung tissue, respectively (P = 0.001 and P = 0.004). Moreover, in NSCLCs, Spearman analysis revealed that expression of CDK5 was correlated with TNM stages (r = 0.129, P = 0.017), lymph node metastasis (r = 0.365, P < 0.001), and pathological grading (r = 0.307, P < 0.001), respectively. The significant correlation was also found between CDK5 expression and TNM stages (r = 0.415, P = 0.049) and lymphatic metastasis (r = 0.469, P = 0.024) in SCLCs.

"Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting Stat3 activation Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer development have not been fully understood. The functions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), a class of total eighteen proteins (HDAC1–11 and SIRT1–7 in mammals) that deacetylate histones and non-histone proteins, in cancers are largely unknown. Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice and HDAC7-depleted human lung cancer cell lines were used as models for studying the function of Hdac7 gene in lung cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to explore the relationship between HDAC7 expression and prognosis of human lung cancers. Recombinant lentivirus-mediated in vivo gene expression or knockdown, Western blotting, and pull-down assay were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis. The number and burden of lung tumor were dramatically reduced in Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice compared to control K-Ras mice. Also, in Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and apoptosis in lung tumors was greatly enhanced. Similarly, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of human lung cancer cell lines expressing shHDAC7 were also significantly suppressed and apoptosis was dramatically elevated respectively. Mechanistic study revealed that Hdac7 mutation in mouse lung tumors or HDAC7 depletion in human tumor cell lines resulted in significantly enhanced acetylation and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Stat3 and HDAC7 protein directly interacted with and deacetylateed STAT3. The Hdac7 mutant-mediated inhibitory effects on lung tumorigenesis in mice and cell proliferation/soft agar colony formation of human lung cancer cell lines were respectively reversed by expressing dnStat3. Finally, the high HDAC7 mRNA level was found to be correlated with poor prognosis of human lung cancer patients. Our study suggests that Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting Stat3 activation via deacetylating Stat3 and may shed a light on the design of new therapeutic strategies for human lung cancer.","hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting stat3 activation lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer development have not been fully understood. the functions of histone deacetylases (hdacs), a class of total eighteen proteins (hdac1–11 and sirt1–7 in mammals) that deacetylate histones and non-histone proteins, in cancers are largely unknown. hdac7; +/−/k-ras mice and hdac7-depleted human lung cancer cell lines were used as models for studying the function of hdac7 gene in lung cancer. kaplan-meier survival analysis was performed to explore the relationship between hdac7 expression and prognosis of human lung cancers. recombinant lentivirus-mediated in vivo gene expression or knockdown, western blotting, and pull-down assay were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis. the number and burden of lung tumor were dramatically reduced in hdac7; +/−/k-ras mice compared to control k-ras mice. also, in hdac7;",hdac promotes lung tumorigenesis inhibit stat activation lung lead cause death worldwide however molecular mechanism underlie lung development fully understood function histone deacetylases hdacs class total eighteen protein hdac sirt mammal deacetylate histone non histone protein largely unknown hdac k ras mouse hdac deplete human lung cell line use model function hdac gene lung kaplan meier survival perform explore relationship hdac expression prognosis human lung recombinant lentivirus mediate vivo gene expression knockdown western blotting pull assay apply investigate underlying molecular mechanism hdac promote lung tumorigenesis number burden lung dramatically reduce hdac k ras mouse compare control k ra mouse also hdac,c,Lung Cancer
"Expression of the candidate tumor suppressor gene hSRBC is frequently lost in primary lung cancers with and without DNA methylation. Recently, the human SRBC (hSRBC) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG), has been mapped to the chromosomal region 11p 15.5--p15.4 where frequent allele loss has been described in lung cancer. Aberrant methylation (referred to as methylation) of the promoter region of TSGs has been identified as an important mechanism for gene silencing. Loss of hSRBC protein expression occurs frequently in lung cancer cell lines and sodium bisulfite sequencing of the promoter region of hSRBC in several lung cancer cell lines suggested that methylation plays an important role in inactivating hSRBC. To determine the methylation status of hSRBC in a large collection of primary lung cancer samples, corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues and lung cancer cell lines (N=52), we designed primers for a methylation-specific PCR assay. Methylation was detected in 41% of primary non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (N=107) and in 80% of primary small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) (N=5), but was seen only in 4% of corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues (N=103). In all, 79% of lung cancer cell lines were methylated and the frequency of hSRBC methylation was significantly higher in SCLC (100%) than in NSCLC (58%) cell lines. Normal hSRBC protein expression was detected in only 18% of primary NSCLCs (N=93) by immunostaining and a significant association between loss of protein expression and methylation was found. hSRBC re-expression was observed after treatment of lung cancer cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In addition, 45% of the 76 hSRBC immunostaining-negative NSCLCs did not have hSRBC promoter methylation, indicating that other mechanisms of hSRBC expression silencing also exist. Both hSRBC immunostaining and methylation results did not correlate with clinicopathological characteristics of these patients. Our findings suggest that hSRBC is a candidate TSG involved in lung cancer pathogenesis, where expression is frequently inactivated by methylation and other mechanisms.","expression of the candidate tumor suppressor gene hsrbc is frequently lost in primary lung cancers with and without dna methylation. recently, the human srbc (hsrbc) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene (tsg), has been mapped to the chromosomal region 11p 15.5--p15.4 where frequent allele loss has been described in lung cancer. aberrant methylation (referred to as methylation) of the promoter region of tsgs has been identified as an important mechanism for gene silencing. loss of hsrbc protein expression occurs frequently in lung cancer cell lines and sodium bisulfite sequencing of the promoter region of hsrbc in several lung cancer cell lines suggested that methylation plays an important role in inactivating hsrbc. to determine the methylation status of hsrbc in a large collection of primary lung cancer samples, corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues and lung cancer cell lines (n=52), we designed primers for a methylation-specific pcr assay. methylation was detected in 41%",expression candidate suppressor gene hsrbc frequently lose primary lung without dna methylation recently human srbc hsrbc gene candidate suppressor gene tsg map chromosomal region p p frequent allele loss describe lung aberrant methylation refer methylation promoter region tsgs identify important mechanism gene silencing loss hsrbc protein expression occur frequently lung cell line sodium bisulfite sequencing promoter region hsrbc several lung cell line suggest methylation play important role inactivate hsrbc determine methylation status hsrbc large collection primary lung sample correspond nonmalignant lung tissue lung cell line n design primer methylation specific pcr assay methylation detect,c,Lung Cancer

The transcriptome data of lung adenocarcinoma were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the hypergeometric correlation of the differently expressed miRNA-lncRNA and miRNA-mRNA were analyzed based on the starBase. In addition, the Kaplan–Meier survival and Cox regression model analysis were used to identify the prognostic ceRNA network and TIICs. Correlation analysis was performed to analysis the correlation between the ceRNA network and TIICs. In the differently expressed RNAs between tumor and normal tissue, a total of 190 miRNAs, 224 lncRNAs and 3024 mRNAs were detected, and the constructed ceRNA network contained 5 lncRNAs, 92 mRNAs and 10 miRNAs. Then, six prognostic RNAs (FKBP3, GPI, LOXL2, IL22RA1, GPR37, and has-miR-148a-3p) were viewed as the key members for constructing the prognostic prediction model in the ceRNA network, and three kinds of TIICs (Monocytes, Macrophages M1, activated mast cells) were identified to be significantly related with the prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Correlation analysis suggested that the FKBP3 was associated with Monocytes and Macrophages M1, and the GPI was obviously related with Monocytes and Macrophages M1. Besides, the LOXL2 was associated with Monocytes and Activated mast cells, and the IL22RA1 was significantly associated with Monocytes and Macrophages M1, while the GPR37 and Macrophages M1 was closely related. The constructed ceRNA network and identified Monocytes, Macrophages M1 and activated Mast cells are all prognostic factors for lung adenocarcinoma.

"Pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer in an immuocompetent patient: a case report and literature review Pulmonary Cryptococcosis is a common fungal infection mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/C.gattii species in immunocompromised patients. Cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with normal immune function are increasingly common in China. Clinical and radiographic features of pulmonary cryptococcosis are various and without obvious characteristics, so it is often misdiagnosed as pulmonary metastatic tumor or tuberculosis. When coexisting with malignant lung tumors, it was more difficult to differentiate from metastatic lung cancer, although the coexistence of pulmonary cryptococcosis and central type lung cancer is rare. Reviewing the imaging manifestations and diagnosis of the case and the relevant literature will contribute to recognition of the disease and a decrease in misdiagnoses. A 72-year-old immunocompetent Han Chinese man had repeated dry cough for more than half a year. CT examination of chest showed an irregular mass at the left hilum of the lung, and two small nodules in the right lung, which were considered as the left central lung cancer with right lung metastasis. However, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer based on the results of laboratory examination, percutaneous lung biopsy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and surgical pathology. The patient underwent surgical resection of the left central type lung cancer and was placed on fluconazole treatment after a positive diagnosis was made. Five years after the lung cancer surgery, the patient had a recurrence, but the pulmonary cryptococcus nodule disappeared.

"Spatio-temporal Distribution Characteristics and Environmental Impact Factors of Lung Cancer Mortality: A Case Study of Yuhui District in Bengbu City, China Among cancers, lung cancer is the most common cause of death in China. For the prevention and control of lung cancer, it is necessary to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality, as well as the changes in the trend and the affecting mechanism. Based on statistics and auto-correlation analysis, this paper studied the spatial and temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality in Yuhui District, Bengbu, Huaihe River Basin, from 2017 to 2020. In addition, Spearman’s Rank Correlation Assessment Model and Geographic Detector Model were used to examine the relationship between environmental factors and lung cancer mortality to identify impact factors and their mechanisms. The findings indicated that: 1) from the characteristics of temporal distribution, the number of lung cancer deaths exhibited a linear growth tendency, with the highest mortality in winter; 2) from the characteristics of spatial distribution, lung cancer mortality showed a strong spatial agglomeration form, concentrating on two clustering areas, located in the old city and the central city of Bengbu, near the Huaihe River; 3) from the point of view of the whole research area, there were 15 impact factors with significant correlation in the built and natural environment factors. The significant impacting factors in the built environment included land use, road traffic, spatial form and blue-green space, which could indirectly affect lung cancer mortality, while air pollution and temperature constituted the significant impacting factors in the natural environment; 4) the influence of screened environmental factors on lung cancer mortality was different. Spatial stratified heterogeneity assessment, the interaction among environmental factors demonstrated statistical significance, it was found that the interaction between environmental factors in pairs had a significant enhancement effect on lung cancer mortality. To some extent, urban planning and policies could reduce lung cancer mortality.","spatio-temporal distribution characteristics and environmental impact factors of lung cancer mortality: a case study of yuhui district in bengbu city, china among cancers, lung cancer is the most common cause of death in china. for the prevention and control of lung cancer, it is necessary to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality, as well as the changes in the trend and the affecting mechanism. based on statistics and auto-correlation analysis, this paper studied the spatial and temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality in yuhui district, bengbu, huaihe river basin, from 2017 to 2020. in addition, spearman’s rank correlation assessment model and geographic detector model were used to examine the relationship between environmental factors and lung cancer mortality to identify impact factors and their mechanisms. the findings indicated that: 1) from the characteristics of temporal distribution, the number of lung cancer deaths exhibited a linear growth tendency,",spatio temporal distribution characteristic environmental impact factor lung mortality yuhui district bengbu city china among lung common cause death china prevention control lung necessary investigate spatial temporal distribution lung mortality well change trend affect mechanism base statistic auto correlation paper spatial temporal distribution lung mortality yuhui district bengbu huaihe river basin addition spearman rank correlation assessment model geographic detector model use examine relationship environmental factor lung mortality identify impact factor mechanism finding indicate characteristic temporal distribution number lung death exhibit linear growth tendency,c,Lung Cancer
"Methylation of the DCLK1 promoter region in circulating free DNA and its prognostic value in lung cancer patients. The possibility of detection of suppressor genes methylation in circulating free DNA (cf-DNA) of cancer patients and the lack of methylation in healthy individuals makes this epigenetic alternation an ideal diagnostic marker of neoplastic processes. Moreover, hypermethylation in several genes promoter was described as a biomarker of lung cancer. Methylation in the gene encoding doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is observed in patients with colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. However, there are no studies concerning DCLK1 methylation in lung cancer patients. The aims of the study was to evaluate the frequency of DCLK1 promoter methylation in cf-DNA of lung cancer patients and of healthy persons as well as the usefulness of this test for predicting the lung cancer course. DCLK1 methylation status was evaluated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood plasma from 65 lung cancer patients and 95 healthy individuals. After DNA bisulfitation, DCLK1 methylation was determined using the qMSP-PCR technique. Moreover, the presence of DCLK1 methylation was correlated with the overall survival (OS) probability of lung cancer patients. DCLK1 promoter methylation was detected in 32 lung cancer patients (49.2 %) and 8 healthy individuals (8.4 %). The methylation of the region before transcription start site (TSS) and the region after TSS of DCLK1 gene was detected in 28 and 11 patients, respectively. In seven cases (10.8 %), the DCLK1 promoter methylation in both regions was reported simultaneously. The methylation was observed slightly frequently in patients with small cell lung cancer (75 % of SCLC patients). The median overall survival of patients with DCLK1 promoter methylation was lower than that of patients without DCLK1 gene modification (p = <0.001, HR = 4.235). The evaluation of DCLK1 promoter region methylation may be useful in both early diagnosis and prediction of the course of lung cancer.","methylation of the dclk1 promoter region in circulating free dna and its prognostic value in lung cancer patients. the possibility of detection of suppressor genes methylation in circulating free dna (cf-dna) of cancer patients and the lack of methylation in healthy individuals makes this epigenetic alternation an ideal diagnostic marker of neoplastic processes. moreover, hypermethylation in several genes promoter was described as a biomarker of lung cancer. methylation in the gene encoding doublecortin-like kinase 1 (dclk1) is observed in patients with colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. however, there are no studies concerning dclk1 methylation in lung cancer patients. the aims of the study was to evaluate the frequency of dclk1 promoter methylation in cf-dna of lung cancer patients and of healthy persons as well as the usefulness of this test for predicting the lung cancer course. dclk1 methylation status was evaluated in dna isolated from peripheral blood plasma from 65 lung",methylation dclk promoter region circulate free dna prognostic value lung possibility detection suppressor gene methylation circulate free dna cf dna lack methylation healthy individual make epigenetic alternation ideal diagnostic marker neoplastic process moreover hypermethylation several gene promoter describe biomarker lung methylation gene encode doublecortin like kinase dclk observe colorectal cholangiocarcinoma however concern dclk methylation lung evaluate frequency dclk promoter methylation cf dna lung healthy person well usefulness test predict lung course dclk methylation status evaluate dna isolate peripheral blood plasma lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes from lung cancer and noncancer patients: a correlation with family histories of cancer. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity was measured in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from cigarette smokers with and without primary lung cancer. Frequency distribution analysis of AHH induction ratios for the two groups revealed an increased number of individuals in the lung cancer patient group with high lymphocyte induction values (P less than 0.05). A similar increase was not shown for high-PAM AHH values in lung cancer patients (P greater than 0.2). When individual PAM and lymphocyte AHH values were compared between noncancer and lung cancer patients, a positive correlation was observed for noncancer patients (r=0.195, P less than 0.001), but no correlation of these values was noted for lung cancer patients. The lung cancer patients were divided into three subgroups of patients showing (I) high PAM and low lymphocyte AHH levels, (II) low PAM and low lymphocyte AHH levels, and (III) low PAM and high lymphocyte AHH levels. When the incidence of family history of cancer was compared for these subgroups, no family cancer history was recorded for persons in subgroup II; however, individuals in subgroups I and III presented family cancer history incidence of 9.5% and 39.3%, respectively. Patients in group III averaged 6 years younger than those in group I. These data suggest that familial factors may be identified among lung cancer patients and that these factors appear to associate as either a cause of an effect with the capacity of pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes to be induced for AHH. The data support the hypothesis that high AHH values may be characteristic of lung cancer patients but show that enzyme values determined from a single tissue, either PAMs or lymphocytes, may not be appropriate for showing whether high AHH inducibility is correlated with lung cancer.","aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes from lung cancer and noncancer patients: a correlation with family histories of cancer. aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (ahh) activity was measured in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (pams) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from cigarette smokers with and without primary lung cancer. frequency distribution analysis of ahh induction ratios for the two groups revealed an increased number of individuals in the lung cancer patient group with high lymphocyte induction values (p less than 0.05). a similar increase was not shown for high-pam ahh values in lung cancer patients (p greater than 0.2). when individual pam and lymphocyte ahh values were compared between noncancer and lung cancer patients, a positive correlation was observed for noncancer patients (r=0.195, p less than 0.001), but no correlation of these values was noted for lung cancer patients. the lung cancer patients were divided into three subgroups of patients showing",aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity pulmonary alveolar macrophage lymphocyte lung noncancer correlation family history aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase ahh activity measure pulmonary alveolar macrophage pams peripheral blood lymphocyte cigarette smoker without primary lung frequency distribution ahh induction ratio two group reveal increased number individual lung group high lymphocyte induction value p less similar increase show high pam ahh value lung p great individual pam lymphocyte ahh value compare noncancer lung positive correlation observe noncancer r p less correlation value note lung lung divide three subgroup show,c,Lung Cancer
"Performance comparison of two commercial human whole-exome capture systems on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma samples Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a valuable tool for molecular landscape characterization of cancer genomes, leading to a better understanding of tumor onset and progression, and opening new avenues in translational oncology. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is the method of choice for storage of clinical samples, however low quality of FFPE genomic DNA (gDNA) can limit its use for downstream applications. To investigate the FFPE specimen suitability for NGS analysis and to establish the performance of two solution-based exome capture technologies, we compared the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of gDNA extracted from 5 fresh frozen (FF) and 5 matched FFPE lung adenocarcinoma tissues using: SeqCap EZ Human Exome v.3.0 (Roche NimbleGen) and SureSelect XT Human All Exon v.5 (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing metrics on Illumina HiSeq were optimal for both exome systems and comparable among FFPE and FF samples, with a slight increase of PCR duplicates in FFPE, mainly in Roche NimbleGen libraries. Comparison of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between FFPE-FF pairs reached overlapping values >90 % in both systems. Both WES showed high concordance with target re-sequencing data by Ion PGM™ in 22 lung-cancer genes, regardless the source of samples. Exon coverage of 623 cancer-related genes revealed high coverage efficiency of both kits, proposing WES as a valid alternative to target re-sequencing. High-quality and reliable data can be successfully obtained from WES of FFPE samples starting from a relatively low amount of input gDNA, suggesting the inclusion of NGS-based tests into clinical contest. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that the WES approach could be extended to a translational research context as well as to the clinic (e.g. to study rare malignancies), where the simultaneous analysis of the whole coding region of the genome may help in the detection of cancer-linked variants.","performance comparison of two commercial human whole-exome capture systems on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma samples next generation sequencing (ngs) has become a valuable tool for molecular landscape characterization of cancer genomes, leading to a better understanding of tumor onset and progression, and opening new avenues in translational oncology. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue is the method of choice for storage of clinical samples, however low quality of ffpe genomic dna (gdna) can limit its use for downstream applications. to investigate the ffpe specimen suitability for ngs analysis and to establish the performance of two solution-based exome capture technologies, we compared the whole-exome sequencing (wes) data of gdna extracted from 5 fresh frozen (ff) and 5 matched ffpe lung adenocarcinoma tissues using: seqcap ez human exome v.3.0 (roche nimblegen) and sureselect xt human all exon v.5 (agilent technologies). sequencing metrics on illumina hiseq were optimal for both exome systems and comparable among",performance comparison two commercial human whole exome capture system formalin fix paraffin embed lung adenocarcinoma sample next generation sequence ng become valuable tool molecular landscape characterization genome lead good understanding onset progression open new avenue translational oncology formalin fix paraffin embed ffpe tissue method choice storage sample however low quality ffpe genomic dna gdna limit use downstream application investigate ffpe specimen suitability ng establish performance two solution base exome capture technologies compare whole exome sequence wes data gdna extract fresh frozen ff match ffpe lung adenocarcinoma tissue use seqcap ez human exome v roche nimblegen sureselect xt human exon v agilent technology sequence metric illumina hiseq optimal exome system comparable among,c,Lung Cancer
"Recent developments in the field of radiotherapy for the management of lung cancer. Lung cancer has a poor prognosis, and further improvements in outcomes are needed. Radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of unresectable lung cancer, and there have been recent developments in the field of radiotherapy for the management of lung cancer. However, to date, there have been few reviews on the improvement in treatment outcomes associated with high precision radiotherapy for lung cancer. Thus, this review aimed to summarize the recent developments in radiotherapy techniques and indicate the future directions in the use of radiotherapy for lung cancer. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresectable stage I lung cancer has been reported to improve local control rates without severe adverse events, such as radiation pneumonitis. For locally advanced lung cancer, a combination of chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors dramatically improves treatment outcomes, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) enables safer radiation therapy with less frequent pneumonitis. Particle beam therapy, such as carbon-ion radiotherapy and proton beam therapy, has been administered as advanced medical care for patients with lung cancer. Since 2024, it has been covered under insurance for early stage lung cancer with tumors ≤ 5 cm in size in Japan. In addition to chemotherapy, local ablative radiotherapy improves treatment outcomes in patients with oligometastatic stage IV lung cancer. A particular problem with radiotherapy for lung cancer is that the target location changes with respiratory motion, and various physical methods have been used to control respiratory motion. Recently, coronavirus disease has had a major impact on lung cancer treatment, and cancer treatment during situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, must be performed carefully. To improve treatment outcomes for lung cancer, it is necessary to fully utilize evolving radiotherapy modalities, and the role of radiotherapy in lung cancer treatment is expected to increase.","recent developments in the field of radiotherapy for the management of lung cancer. lung cancer has a poor prognosis, and further improvements in outcomes are needed. radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of unresectable lung cancer, and there have been recent developments in the field of radiotherapy for the management of lung cancer. however, to date, there have been few reviews on the improvement in treatment outcomes associated with high precision radiotherapy for lung cancer. thus, this review aimed to summarize the recent developments in radiotherapy techniques and indicate the future directions in the use of radiotherapy for lung cancer. stereotactic body radiotherapy (sbrt) for unresectable stage i lung cancer has been reported to improve local control rates without severe adverse events, such as radiation pneumonitis. for locally advanced lung cancer, a combination of chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors dramatically improves treatment outcomes, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (imrt)",recent development field radiotherapy management lung lung poor prognosis improvement outcome need radiotherapy play important role unresectable lung recent development field radiotherapy management lung however date review improvement outcome associate high precision radiotherapy lung thus review summarize recent development radiotherapy technique indicate future direction use radiotherapy lung stereotactic body radiotherapy sbrt unresectable stage lung report improve local control rate without severe adverse event radiation pneumonitis locally advanced lung combination chemoradiotherapy adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor dramatically improve outcome intensity modulate radiotherapy imrt,c,Lung Cancer

"Secular trend analysis of lung cancer incidence in Sihui city, China between 1987 and 2011 Background: With industrial and economic development in recent decades in South China, cancer incidence may have changed due to the changing lifestyle and environment. However, the trends of lung cancer and the roles of smoking and other environmental risk factors in the development of lung cancer in rural areas of South China remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the lung cancer incidence trends and the possible causes of these trends. Methods: Joinpoint regression analysis and the age-period-cohort (APC) model were used to analyze the lung cancer incidence trends in Sihui, Guangdong province, China between 1987 and 2011, and explore the possible causes of these trends. Results: A total of 2,397 lung cancer patients were involved in this study. A 3-fold increase in the incidence of lung cancer in both sexes was observed over the 25-year period. Joinpoint regression analysis showed that while the incidence continued to increase steadily in females during the entire period, a sharp acceleration was observed in males starting in 2005. The full APC model was selected to describe age, period, and birth cohort effects on lung cancer incidence trends in Sihui. The age cohorts in both sexes showed a continuously significant increase in the relative risk (RR) of lung cancer, with a peak in the eldest age group (80-84 years). The RR of lung cancer showed a fluctuating curve in both sexes. The birth cohorts identified an increased trend in both males and females; however, males had a plateau in the youngest cohorts who were born during 1955-1969. Conclusions: Increasing trends of the incidence of lung cancer in Sihui were dominated by the effects of age and birth cohorts. Social aging, smoking, and environmental changes may play important roles in such trends.","secular trend analysis of lung cancer incidence in sihui city, china between 1987 and 2011 background: with industrial and economic development in recent decades in south china, cancer incidence may have changed due to the changing lifestyle and environment. however, the trends of lung cancer and the roles of smoking and other environmental risk factors in the development of lung cancer in rural areas of south china remain unclear. the purpose of this study was to explore the lung cancer incidence trends and the possible causes of these trends. methods: joinpoint regression analysis and the age-period-cohort (apc) model were used to analyze the lung cancer incidence trends in sihui, guangdong province, china between 1987 and 2011, and explore the possible causes of these trends. results: a total of 2,397 lung cancer patients were involved in this study. a 3-fold increase in the incidence of lung cancer in both sexes was",secular trend lung incidence sihui city china industrial economic development recent decade south china incidence may change due change lifestyle environment however trend lung role smoking environmental risk factor development lung rural area south china remain unclear explore lung incidence trend possible cause trend method joinpoint regression age period cohort apc model use analyze lung incidence trend sihui guangdong province china explore possible cause trend result total lung involve fold increase incidence lung sex,c,Lung Cancer

"RAGE acts as an oncogenic role and promotes the metastasis of human lung cancer. RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-product) is thought to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis of various types of cancer. However, RAGE is constitutively expressed in the normal lung and down-regulated in cancerous lung, while the opposite evidence shows that RAGE-mediated signaling contributes to the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. Therefore, the role of RAGE in lung cancer progression is still unclear to be further investigated. In this study, RAGE-overexpressed stable clones of human lung cancer A549 cells and two local lung adenocarcinoma cell lines CL1-0 and CL1-5 were utilized to verify the effect of RAGE on lung cancer cells while the in vivo xenograft animal model was further performed to evaluate the role of RAGE in the progression of lung cancer. The growth of A549 cells was inhibited by RAGE overexpression. p53-dependent p21CIP1 expression contributed to RAGE-induced growth inhibition by suppressing CDK2 kinase activity and retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation in vitro. On the other hand, RAGE overexpression promoted migration, invasion, and mesenchymal features of lung adenocarcinoma cells through ERK signaling. Furthermore, an in vivo xenograft experiment indicated that RAGE promoted the metastasis of lung cancer cells with p21CIP1 up-regulation, ERK activation, and the changes of EMT markers. Regarding to the involvement of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) in the microenvironment, we monitored the expressions of TAM markers including CD68 and CD163 as well as angiogenesis marker CD31 in xenograft slice. The data showed that RAGE might induce the accumulation of TAM in lung cancer cells and further accelerate the in vivo tumor growth. In summary, our study provides evidence indicating the distinct in vitro and in vivo effects of RAGE and related mechanisms on tumor growth and metastasis, which shed light on the oncogenic role of RAGE in lung cancer.","rage acts as an oncogenic role and promotes the metastasis of human lung cancer. rage (receptor for advanced glycation end-product) is thought to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis of various types of cancer. however, rage is constitutively expressed in the normal lung and down-regulated in cancerous lung, while the opposite evidence shows that rage-mediated signaling contributes to the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. therefore, the role of rage in lung cancer progression is still unclear to be further investigated. in this study, rage-overexpressed stable clones of human lung cancer a549 cells and two local lung adenocarcinoma cell lines cl1-0 and cl1-5 were utilized to verify the effect of rage on lung cancer cells while the in vivo xenograft animal model was further performed to evaluate the role of rage in the progression of lung cancer. the growth of a549 cells was inhibited by rage overexpression. p53-dependent p21cip1 expression contributed",rage act oncogenic role promote metastasis human lung rage receptor advanced glycation end product think associate metastasis poor prognosis various type however rage constitutively express normal lung regulate cancerous lung opposite evidence show rage mediate signal contributes tumorigenesis lung therefore role rage lung progression still unclear far investigate rage overexpressed stable clone human lung cell two local lung adenocarcinoma cell line cl cl utilize verify effect rage lung cell vivo xenograft animal model far perform evaluate role rage progression lung growth cell inhibit rage overexpression p dependent p cip expression contribute,c,Lung Cancer

"Myofibroblasts derived type V collagen promoting tissue mechanical stress and facilitating metastasis and therapy resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with a dismal 5-year survival rate, particularly for Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Mechanical changes within the tumor microenvironment, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibroblast activity, play pivotal roles in cancer progression and metastasis. However, the specific impact of the basement membrane (BM) on the mechanical characteristics of LUAD remains unclear. This study aims to identify BM genes influencing internal mechanical stress in tumors, elucidating their effects on LUAD metastasis and therapy resistance, and exploring strategies to counteract these effects. Using Matrigel overlay and Transwell assays, we found that mechanical stress, mimicked by matrix application, augmented LUAD cell migration and invasion, correlating with ECM alterations and activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Employing machine learning, we developed the SVM_Score model based on relevant BM genes, which accurately predicted LUAD patient prognosis and EMT propensity across multiple datasets. Lower SVM_Scores were associated with worse survival outcomes, elevated cancer-related pathways, increased Tumor Mutation Burden, and higher internal mechanical stress in LUAD tissues. Notably, the SVM_Score was closely linked to COL5A1 expression in myofibroblasts, a key marker of mechanical stress. High COL5A1 expression from myofibroblasts promoted tumor invasiveness and EMT pathway activation in LUAD cells. Additionally, treatment with Sorafenib, which targets COL5A1 secretion, attenuated the tumor-promoting effects of myofibroblast-derived COL5A1, inhibiting LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and enhancing chemosensitivity. In conclusion, this study elucidates the complex interplay between mechanical stress, ECM alterations, and LUAD progression. The SVM_Score emerges as a robust prognostic tool reflecting tumor mechanical characteristics, while Sorafenib intervention targeting COL5A1 secretion presents a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate LUAD aggressiveness. These findings deepen our understanding of the biomechanical aspects of LUAD and offer insights for future research and clinical applications.","myofibroblasts derived type v collagen promoting tissue mechanical stress and facilitating metastasis and therapy resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells. lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with a dismal 5-year survival rate, particularly for lung adenocarcinoma (luad). mechanical changes within the tumor microenvironment, such as extracellular matrix (ecm) remodeling and fibroblast activity, play pivotal roles in cancer progression and metastasis. however, the specific impact of the basement membrane (bm) on the mechanical characteristics of luad remains unclear. this study aims to identify bm genes influencing internal mechanical stress in tumors, elucidating their effects on luad metastasis and therapy resistance, and exploring strategies to counteract these effects. using matrigel overlay and transwell assays, we found that mechanical stress, mimicked by matrix application, augmented luad cell migration and invasion, correlating with ecm alterations and activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) pathway. employing machine learning, we developed the svm_score model",myofibroblasts derive type v collagen promote tissue mechanical stress facilitating metastasis therapy resistance lung adenocarcinoma cell lung lead cause relate mortality globally dismal year survival rate particularly lung adenocarcinoma luad mechanical change within microenvironment extracellular matrix ecm remodeling fibroblast activity play pivotal role progression metastasis however specific impact basement membrane bm mechanical characteristic luad remain unclear identify bm gene influence internal mechanical stress elucidate effect luad metastasis therapy resistance explore strategy counteract effect use matrigel overlay transwell assay find mechanical stress mimic matrix application augment luad cell migration invasion correlate ecm alteration activation epithelial mesenchymal transition emt pathway employ machine learning develop svm score model,c,Lung Cancer

"The role of CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE in monitoring tumor response to Nivolumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE are tumor markers used for monitoring the response to chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer, respectively. Their role in cancer immunotherapy needs to be elucidated. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks within the Italian Nivolumab Expanded Access Program. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each cycle up to cycle 5 and then every two cycles until patient’s withdrawn from the study. All patients underwent a CT-scan after every 4 cycles of treatment and responses were classified according to RECIST 1.1. The biomarkers serum levels were measured with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for CEA and with an immuno radiometric assay for CYFRA21-1 and NSE. The markers values at baseline and after 4 cycles were used to analyze the relationship between their variation over baseline and the tumor response, evaluated as disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD), and survival (PFS and OS). A total of 70 patients were evaluable for the analysis. Overall, a disease control was obtained in 24 patients (35.8%, 4 PR + 20 SD). After 4 cycles of nivolumab a CEA or CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% over the baseline was significantly associated with DCR (CEA, p = 0.021; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001), PFS (CEA, p = 0.028; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001) and OS (CEA, p = 0.026; CYFRA21-1, p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis confirmed the ability of CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% to predict DCR (p = 0.002) and PFS (p < 0.001).

"Syntenin overexpression in human lung cancer tissue and serum is associated with poor prognosis Lung cancer is the major malignant tumour. The present study was conducted to determine the expression level of syntenin in lung cancer tissues and serum from lung cancer patients and to explore its clinical significance. Syntenin expression levels were determined in paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue specimens (n = 191) using immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expressions of syntenin in fresh lung cancer tissues and the paracancerous tissues were examined by RT-qPCR (n = 25). Syntenin and VEGF expression levels were measured in serum from patients with lung cancer (n = 60) and control subjects (n = 30) using ELISA. The associations between syntenin and the clinicopathological features or prognosis in 191 patients with lung cancer were analysed. The correlation between the syntenin and VEGF levels in serum from 60 lung cancer patients was analysed.

"Gender disparities in lung cancer incidence in the United States during 2001-2019. Lung cancer ranks as one of the top malignancies and the leading cause of cancer death in both males and females in the US. Using a cancer database covering the entire population, this study was to determine the gender disparities in lung cancer incidence during 2001-2019. Cancer patients were obtained from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The SEER*Stat software was applied to calculate the age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR). Temporal changes in lung cancer incidence were analyzed by the Joinpoint software. A total of 4,086,432 patients (53.3% of males) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Among them, 52.1% were 70 years or older, 82.7% non-Hispanic white, 39.7% from the South, and 72.6% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

This retrospective study compared the cancer survival rates of a cohort of 122 cancer patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM), or systemic sclerosis with that of a cohort of 366 age-, sex-, and, cancer type-matched patients without RD who received medical care from 2000 to 2014. Staging, comorbidities, and functional status were ascertained. Survival was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risk of death was estimated as a hazard ratio (HR) using Cox regression analysis. The mean age of the RD patients at the time of cancer diagnosis was 58.7 ± 11.5 years. The overall survival rate of gastric cancer patients did not differ between the cohorts. The survival of lung or breast cancer was worse in patients with RA or DM/PM than in those without RD (all, p < 0.05). After adjusting for cancer stage, comorbidity index, performance status and age at the time of cancer diagnosis (as well as interstitial lung disease for lung cancer group), the mortality rate among lung cancer patients with RA was significantly higher (HR, 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.03–3.18) than that of lung cancer patients without RD, whereas SSc was associated with decreased mortality of lung cancer (HR, 0.16; 95 % CI, 0.04–0.58).

"Forecasting lung cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence to year 2030. Background Lung cancer incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide and there is a focus on prevention, early detection, and development of new treatments which will impact the epidemiological patterns of lung cancer. The clinical characteristics and the trends in incidence, mortality, and prevalence of lung cancer in Denmark from 2006 through 2015 are described and a model for predicting the future epidemiological profile of lung cancer through 2030 is introduced. Methods The study population comprised all cases of lung cancer, registered in the Danish Cancer Registry, who were alive on January 1, 2006 or had a first-time ever diagnosis of lung cancer during 2006 through 2015. Information on morphology, stage of the disease, comorbidity and survival was obtained from other Danish health registers. Based on NORDCAN data and estimated patient mortality rates as well as prevalence proportions for the period 2006 through 2015, future case numbers of annual incidence, deaths, and resulting prevalence were projected. Results A total of 44.291 patients were included in the study. A shift towards more patients diagnosed with lower stages and with adenocarcinoma was observed. The incidence increased and the patient mortality rate decreased significantly, with a doubling of the prevalence during the observation period. We project that the numbers of prevalent cases of lung cancer in Denmark most likely will increase from about 10,000 at the end of 2015 to about 23,000 at the end of 2030. Conclusions Our findings support that lung cancer is being diagnosed at an earlier stage, that incidence will stop increasing, that mortality will decrease further, and that the prevalence will continue to increase substantially. Projections of cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence are important for planning health services and should be updated at regular intervals.","forecasting lung cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence to year 2030. background lung cancer incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide and there is a focus on prevention, early detection, and development of new treatments which will impact the epidemiological patterns of lung cancer. the clinical characteristics and the trends in incidence, mortality, and prevalence of lung cancer in denmark from 2006 through 2015 are described and a model for predicting the future epidemiological profile of lung cancer through 2030 is introduced. methods the study population comprised all cases of lung cancer, registered in the danish cancer registry, who were alive on january 1, 2006 or had a first-time ever diagnosis of lung cancer during 2006 through 2015. information on morphology, stage of the disease, comorbidity and survival was obtained from other danish health registers. based on nordcan data and estimated patient mortality rates as well as prevalence proportions for the period",forecast lung incidence mortality prevalence year lung incidence prevalence increase worldwide focus prevention early detection development new impact epidemiological pattern lung characteristic trend incidence mortality prevalence lung denmark describe model predict future epidemiological profile lung introduce method population comprise lung register danish registry alive january first time ever diagnosis lung information morphology stage comorbidity survival obtain danish health register base nordcan data estimate mortality rate well prevalence proportion period,c,Lung Cancer

"Activity of vitamin A analogues in cell cultures of mouse epidermis and organ cultures of hamster trachea. FIFTY years after the discovery that vitamin A controls cel differentiation in epithelial tissues the mechanism involved is still unknown. The recent introduction of two-cell and organ culture systems, involving serum-free medium, for the assay of vitamin A activity in vitro may help. One assay uses epidermal cell cultures derived from mouse skin1 and the other uses tracheal organ cultures from vitamin A-deficient hamsters2. In both, the observed cellular response depends on the addition of vitamin A, which induces a marked increase in the cellular RNA of the skin cultures and a change from the production of keratin to the production of cilia and mucus in the tracheal organ cultures. We have now investigated the Biological activity of seven analogues of natural vitamin A ester (β-retinyl acetate) and vitamin A acid (β-retinoic acid), in line with the common practice of assaying physiological and pharmacological actions of vitamins, hormones and drugs using structural analogues of a parent compound. In the analogues we used, the 5,6-cyclohexenyl ring system of natural vitamin A is modified substantially. Although data obtained in vivo show that modification of the ring portion of the molecule can reduce growth-promoting activity3–5, we found that several vitamin A analogues with alterations in the ring, including a shift of the 5,6-double bond of the cyclohexene ring to the 4,5-position and replacement of the cyclohexene ring with substituted aromatic and cyclopentene rings, have substantial activity in the skin and tracheobronchial assays. Because of the sensitivity of the two assays it is now possible to assay vitamin A activity in the 10−9–10−10M range (30–300 pg ml−1). Moreover, there is excellent correlation between the results of the two assays in terms of the evaluation of Biol.ogical activity of new analogues.","activity of vitamin a analogues in cell cultures of mouse epidermis and organ cultures of hamster trachea. fifty years after the discovery that vitamin a controls cel differentiation in epithelial tissues the mechanism involved is still unknown. the recent introduction of two-cell and organ culture systems, involving serum-free medium, for the assay of vitamin a activity in vitro may help. one assay uses epidermal cell cultures derived from mouse skin1 and the other uses tracheal organ cultures from vitamin a-deficient hamsters2. in both, the observed cellular response depends on the addition of vitamin a, which induces a marked increase in the cellular rna of the skin cultures and a change from the production of keratin to the production of cilia and mucus in the tracheal organ cultures. we have now investigated the biological activity of seven analogues of natural vitamin a ester (β-retinyl acetate) and vitamin a acid (β-retinoic acid),",activity vitamin analogue cell culture mouse epidermis organ culture hamster trachea fifty year discovery vitamin control cel differentiation epithelial tissue mechanism involve still unknown recent two cell organ culture system involve serum free medium assay vitamin activity vitro may help one assay use epidermal cell culture derive mouse skin us tracheal organ culture vitamin deficient hamster observed cellular response depend addition vitamin induce marked increase cellular rna skin culture change production keratin production cilium mucus tracheal organ culture investigate biological activity seven analogue natural vitamin ester retinyl acetate vitamin acid retinoic acid,c,Lung Cancer
"Interleukin-1β-mediated suppression of microRNA-101 and upregulation of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is involved in particle-induced lung cancer Lung cancer may be a result of complex factors. Small mineral particle is the well-known inducer of lung cancer. Previous study revealed the high morbidity of lung cancer in Xuan Wei in China, and the main cause of lung cancer is the use of smoky coal there. And it is generally accepted that chronic inflammation induced by small mineral particle may be a cause of lung cancer. But the relationship between chronic lung inflammation and lung cancer is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that silica particle was able to induce the secretion of interleukin-1β from a Xuan Wei lung cancer cell line, XWLC-05. At the same time, microRNA-101 (mir-101) was found to be downregulated by the treatment of silica particle. Interestingly, the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-1β antibody can reduce silica particle-induced downregulation of mir-101. Twenty-four Xuan Wei lung tumor tissues were collected to detect the expression level of mir-101 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is the potential target of mir-101. The results showed that mir-101 was down-regulated and EZH2 were upregulated. Subsequently, the roles of mir-101 and EZH2 in tumor growth and progression in vitro were tested. Overexpression of mir-101 mimics was able to suppress the expression of EZH2 in XWLC-05 cells. And this resulted in the inhibited tumor cell growth and attenuated cell migration. The results in the present study showed that particle can induce the secretion of interleukin-1β. Interleukin-1β subsequently induces the downregulation of mir-101, which may result in the upregulated level of EZH2, and occurrence of lung cancer. We for the first time proposed the role interleukin-1β-mir-101-EZH2 axes in the particle-induced lung cancer. Further study may be needed to decipher the detailed mechanism involved.","interleukin-1β-mediated suppression of microrna-101 and upregulation of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is involved in particle-induced lung cancer lung cancer may be a result of complex factors. small mineral particle is the well-known inducer of lung cancer. previous study revealed the high morbidity of lung cancer in xuan wei in china, and the main cause of lung cancer is the use of smoky coal there. and it is generally accepted that chronic inflammation induced by small mineral particle may be a cause of lung cancer. but the relationship between chronic lung inflammation and lung cancer is largely unknown. in the present study, we found that silica particle was able to induce the secretion of interleukin-1β from a xuan wei lung cancer cell line, xwlc-05. at the same time, microrna-101 (mir-101) was found to be downregulated by the treatment of silica particle. interestingly, the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-1β antibody",interleukin mediate suppression microrna upregulation enhancer zeste homolog involve particle induced lung lung may result complex factor small mineral particle well known inducer lung previous reveal high morbidity lung xuan wei china main cause lung use smoky coal generally accept chronic inflammation induce small mineral particle may cause lung relationship chronic lung inflammation lung largely unknown present find silica particle able induce secretion interleukin xuan wei lung cell line xwlc time microrna mir find downregulated silica particle interestingly interleukin receptor antagonist interleukin antibody,c,Lung Cancer
"Increased lung cancer risks are similar whether arsenic is ingested or inhaled In 1980, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined there was sufficient evidence to support that inorganic arsenic was a human lung carcinogen based on studies involving exposure through inhalation. In 2004, IARC listed arsenic in drinking water as a cause of lung cancer, making arsenic the first substance established to cause human cancer through two unrelated pathways of exposure. It may initially seem counterintuitive that arsenic in drinking water would cause human lung cancer, and even if it did, one might expect risks to be orders of magnitude lower than those from direct inhalation into the lungs. In this paper, we consider lung cancer dose-response relationships for inhalation and ingestion of arsenic by focusing on two key studies, a cohort mortality study in the United States involving Tacoma smelter workers inhaling arsenic, and a lung cancer case-control study involving ingestion of arsenic in drinking water in northern Chile. When exposure was assessed based on the absorbed dose identified by concentrations of arsenic in urine, there was very little difference in the dose-response findings for lung cancer relative risks between inhalation and ingestion. The lung cancer mortality rate ratio estimate was 8.0 (95% CI 3.2-16.5, P<0.001) for an average urine concentration of 1179 microg/l after inhalation, and the odds ratio estimate of the lung cancer incidence rate ratio was 7.1 (95% CI 3.4-14.8, P<0.001) for an estimated average urine concentration of 825 microg/l following ingestion. The slopes of the linear dose-response relationships between excess relative risk (RR-1) for lung cancer and urinary arsenic concentration were similar for the two routes of exposure. We conclude that lung cancer risks probably depend on absorbed dose, and not on whether inorganic arsenic is ingested or inhaled.","increased lung cancer risks are similar whether arsenic is ingested or inhaled in 1980, the international agency for research on cancer (iarc) determined there was sufficient evidence to support that inorganic arsenic was a human lung carcinogen based on studies involving exposure through inhalation. in 2004, iarc listed arsenic in drinking water as a cause of lung cancer, making arsenic the first substance established to cause human cancer through two unrelated pathways of exposure. it may initially seem counterintuitive that arsenic in drinking water would cause human lung cancer, and even if it did, one might expect risks to be orders of magnitude lower than those from direct inhalation into the lungs. in this paper, we consider lung cancer dose-response relationships for inhalation and ingestion of arsenic by focusing on two key studies, a cohort mortality study in the united states involving tacoma smelter workers inhaling arsenic, and a lung",increase lung risk similar whether arsenic ingest inhale international agency research iarc determine sufficient evidence support inorganic arsenic human lung carcinogen base involve exposure inhalation iarc list arsenic drink water cause lung make arsenic first substance establish cause human two unrelated pathway exposure may initially seem counterintuitive arsenic drinking water would cause human lung even one might expect risk order magnitude low direct inhalation lung paper consider lung dose response relationship inhalation ingestion arsenic focus two key cohort mortality united state involve tacoma smelter worker inhale arsenic lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Why and how would we implement a lung cancer screening program For decades, lung cancer has been the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality. There has been very little improvement in the prognosis of lung cancer. Early treatment following early diagnosis is considered to have potential for development. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large, well-designed randomized controlled trial, evaluated low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as a screening tool for lung cancer. Compared with chest X-ray, annual LDCT screening reduced death from lung cancer and overall mortality by 20 and 6.7 %, respectively, in high-risk people aged 55–74 years. Several smaller trials of LDCT screening are under way, but none are sufficiently powered to detect a 20 % reduction in lung cancer death. Thus, it is very unlikely that the NLST results will be replicated. In addition, the NLST raises several issues related to screening, such as the high false-positive rate, overdiagnosis and cost. Healthcare providers and systems are now left with the question of whether the available findings should be translated into practice. We present the main reasons for implementing lung cancer screening in high-risk adults and discuss the main issues related to lung cancer screening. We stress the importance of eligibility criteria, smoking cessation programs, primary care physicians, and informed-decision making should lung cancer screening be implemented. Seven years ago, we were waiting for the results of trials. Such evidence is now available. Similar to almost all other cancer screens, uncertainties exist and persist even after recent scientific efforts and data. We believe that by staying within the characteristics of the original trial and appropriately sharing the evidence as well as the uncertainties, it is reasonable to implement a LDCT lung cancer screening program for smokers and former smokers.","why and how would we implement a lung cancer screening program for decades, lung cancer has been the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality. there has been very little improvement in the prognosis of lung cancer. early treatment following early diagnosis is considered to have potential for development. the national lung screening trial (nlst), a large, well-designed randomized controlled trial, evaluated low-dose computed tomography (ldct) as a screening tool for lung cancer. compared with chest x-ray, annual ldct screening reduced death from lung cancer and overall mortality by 20 and 6.7 %, respectively, in high-risk people aged 55–74 years. several smaller trials of ldct screening are under way, but none are sufficiently powered to detect a 20 % reduction in lung cancer death. thus, it is very unlikely that the nlst results will be replicated. in addition, the nlst raises several issues related to screening, such",would implement lung screen program decade lung common term incidence mortality little improvement prognosis lung early follow early diagnosis consider potential development national lung screen trial nlst large well design randomize control trial evaluate low dose compute tomography ldct screening tool lung compare chest x ray annual ldct screen reduce death lung overall mortality respectively high risk people age year several small trial ldct screen way none sufficiently power detect reduction lung death thus unlikely nlst result replicate addition nlst raise several issue relate screen,c,Lung Cancer

"Epidemiological study on the relationship between the environmental pollution and lung cancer in high lung cancer incidence areas, China Xuanwei and Fuyuan, two counties located in southwest China, are areas with exceptionally high lung cancer incidence since the 1970s. In this study, questionnaires from a total of 18 communes, and 28 administrative villages (consisting of 280 small villages) in the two counties were fulfilled and collected. The sampling sites were randomly chosen in consideration of the incidence rate of lung cancer and the types of coal used. The sampling sites were divided into high lung cancer occurrence areas and low lung cancer occurrence areas. Industrial and environmental information was investigated and finally analyzed for the possible relationship to the lung cancer. It indicated that 78.1 % of the villages in high lung cancer incidence areas had been found using smoky coal or coking coals in people’s everyday lives; 43.4 % of these villages located near the coking factories, 31.1 % near the iron-zinc smelters and 11.8 % near the chemical industries. In the low lung cancer incidence areas, 78.8 % of the villages had been found using non-smoky coals (anthracite) in people’s everyday lives; 26.9 % of these villages are near the coking factories, 23.1 % near the iron-zinc smelters and 5.8 % near the chemical industries. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the coal type used was a foremost risk factor related to incidence of lung cancer [β > 0, Exp (β) >1, P < 0.05]. The use of smoky coals and coking coals seemed to be a hazardous factor for lung cancer generation, while non-smoky coals seemed to have no significant relationship to the lung cancer incidence. The results in this study added basic and important data and should be helpful for the future study on the etiology of lung cancer.","epidemiological study on the relationship between the environmental pollution and lung cancer in high lung cancer incidence areas, china xuanwei and fuyuan, two counties located in southwest china, are areas with exceptionally high lung cancer incidence since the 1970s. in this study, questionnaires from a total of 18 communes, and 28 administrative villages (consisting of 280 small villages) in the two counties were fulfilled and collected. the sampling sites were randomly chosen in consideration of the incidence rate of lung cancer and the types of coal used. the sampling sites were divided into high lung cancer occurrence areas and low lung cancer occurrence areas. industrial and environmental information was investigated and finally analyzed for the possible relationship to the lung cancer. it indicated that 78.1 % of the villages in high lung cancer incidence areas had been found using smoky coal or coking coals in people’s everyday lives; 43.4 %",epidemiological relationship environmental pollution lung high lung incidence area china xuanwei fuyuan two county locate southwest china area exceptionally high lung incidence since questionnaires total commune administrative village consist small village two county fulfil collect sample site randomly choose consideration incidence rate lung type coal use sample site divide high lung occurrence area low lung occurrence area industrial environmental information investigate finally analyze possible relationship lung indicate village high lung incidence area find use smoky coal coke coal people everyday life,c,Lung Cancer
"MET amplification identified by next-generation sequencing and its clinical relevance for MET inhibitors. BACKGROUND MET amplification plays an important role in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) either de novo or in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) settings. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the standard method for MET amplification. With more and more discoveries of oncogenic driver genes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays a significant role in precision oncology. Meanwhile, the role of NGS in MET amplification remains uncertain. METHODS Forty patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC were included. FISH and NGS were conducted prior to MET inhibitors treatment. MET amplification by FISH was defined as a MET/CEP7 ratio of  >  2.0 and/or copy number (CN)  >  5. MET amplification by NGS was defined as gene copy number (GCN)  ≥  5. RESULTS The concordance rate among FISH and NGS was 62.5% (25/40). MET amplification identified by FISH showed the optimal predictive value. The partial response (PR) rate was 68.0% (17/25 with MET amplification) vs. 6.7% (1/15 without MET amplification); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4 months versus 1.0 months (P  < 0.001). MET amplification identified by NGS failed to distinguish significant clinical outcomes. The PR rate was 60.0% (6/10, with MET GCN  ≥ 5) vs. 40.0% (12/30, with MET GCN  < 5); the median PFS was 4.8 months vs. 2.2 months (P  = 0.357). The PR rate was 68.8% (11/16) and the median PFS was 4.8 months in patients with focal amplification by NGS. CONCLUSIONS MET amplification identified by FISH remains the optimal biomarker to identify suitable candidates for MET-TKI therapy. In comparison, amplification identified by NGS seems not as robust to be effective predictive biomarker. Further exploration is needed regarding the focal amplification by NGS in predicting the efficacy.","met amplification identified by next-generation sequencing and its clinical relevance for met inhibitors. background met amplification plays an important role in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) either de novo or in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (egfr-tki) settings. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) is the standard method for met amplification. with more and more discoveries of oncogenic driver genes, next-generation sequencing (ngs) plays a significant role in precision oncology. meanwhile, the role of ngs in met amplification remains uncertain. methods forty patients diagnosed with advanced nsclc were included. fish and ngs were conducted prior to met inhibitors treatment. met amplification by fish was defined as a met/cep7 ratio of > 2.0 and/or copy number (cn) > 5. met amplification by ngs was defined as gene copy number (gcn) ≥ 5. results the concordance rate among fish and ngs was 62.5% (25/40). met amplification identified by",meet amplification identify next generation sequencing relevance met inhibitor meet amplification play important role development non small cell lung nsclc either de novo resistance epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor egfr tki setting fluorescence situ hybridization fish standard method meet amplification discovery oncogenic driver gene next generation sequence ng play significant role precision oncology meanwhile role ng met amplification remain uncertain method forty diagnose advanced nsclc include fish ng conduct prior meet inhibitor meet amplification fish define met cep ratio copy number cn meet amplification ng define gene copy number gcn result concordance rate among fish ng meet amplification identify,c,Lung Cancer
"Dose-dependent M2 macrophage polarization induced by Talaromyces marneffei promotes lung cancer cell growth via arginine-ornithine-cycle activation. It is now widely accepted that lungs are colonized by diverse microbes. Dysbiosis of the lung microbiota has been found to affect the progression of lung cancer. Fungi are a major component of the lung microbiota. However, the causal links between the mycobiome or specific species and lung cancer remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a study examining the composition of lung mycobiota in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients using shotgun metagenomics. The differential taxa between NSCLC patients and non-cancer controls were defined by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Nested PCR was used to measure the abundance of specific fungal species. Metabolomics analysis was performed to investigate the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages triggered by intracellular infection of specific fungal species. In vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to examine the effect of the specific fungus on cancer cell growth. Our findings showed that Ascomycota, Microsporidia and Mucoromycota were the dominant fungal taxa in the lungs. Talaromyces marneffei (T.marneffei) was the most significantly differential fungus between lung cancer patients and non-cancer controls, with its abundance positively correlated with lung cancer. The lung cancer animal model demonstrated that T.marneffei promotes lung cancer growth. Our study also demonstrated that T.marneffei promotes lung cancer cell growth by inducing dose-dependent M2 macrophage polarization through arginine-ornithine-cycle activation. Furthermore, inhibition of arginase can reduce M2 polarization of macrophages and the survival of T. marneffei inside macrophages. In summary, our study reveals that the increased abundance of T. marneffei in the lungs affects lung cancer cell growth by triggering arginine-induced M2 polarization of macrophages. These findings provide potential drug targets for the development of therapies aimed at targeting the survival of fungi inside macrophages in the fight against cancer.","dose-dependent m2 macrophage polarization induced by talaromyces marneffei promotes lung cancer cell growth via arginine-ornithine-cycle activation. it is now widely accepted that lungs are colonized by diverse microbes. dysbiosis of the lung microbiota has been found to affect the progression of lung cancer. fungi are a major component of the lung microbiota. however, the causal links between the mycobiome or specific species and lung cancer remain unclear. to address this, we conducted a study examining the composition of lung mycobiota in non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients using shotgun metagenomics. the differential taxa between nsclc patients and non-cancer controls were defined by the wilcoxon rank-sum test. nested pcr was used to measure the abundance of specific fungal species. metabolomics analysis was performed to investigate the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages triggered by intracellular infection of specific fungal species. in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to examine the effect of the",dose dependent macrophage polarization induce talaromyces marneffei promotes lung cell growth via arginine ornithine cycle activation widely accept lung colonize diverse microbes dysbiosis lung microbiota find affect progression lung fungi major component lung microbiota however causal link mycobiome specific specie lung remain unclear address conduct examine composition lung mycobiota non small cell lung nsclc use shotgun metagenomics differential taxon nsclc non control define wilcoxon rank sum test nest pcr use measure abundance specific fungal specie metabolomics perform investigate metabolic reprogramming macrophage trigger intracellular infection specific fungal specie vitro vivo assay conduct examine effect,c,Lung Cancer

"Incidence and risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected patients. Lung cancer is one of the most common non-AIDS-defining malignancies among HIV-infected patients. The incidence of lung cancer has significantly increased in the HIV-positive population in recent years. The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence and risk of lung cancer in published population-based studies of people with HIV/AIDS. Published literature from PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and Google Scholar was retrieved. Sixty-five publications were selected and assessed for the following parameters: research coverage and location; continent; study period; duration of follow-up; lung cancer cases; HIV cases; incidence rate; and overall SIR or adjusted IRR. In addition, the risk of lung cancer was compared based on age, gender, HIV exposure category, CD4 count, and periods with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Lung cancer risk was greater among HIV-infected individuals compared with the general population. SIRs or adjusted IRRs were 1.5–3.4 in Europe, 0.7–6.9 in the USA, and 5.0 in Africa. Most, but not all studies did not observe a significant change in the incidence and risk of lung cancer between the pre-HAART and HAART eras. In most studies, the risk of lung cancer was higher among women, younger individuals, and injection drug users (IDUs), but the incidence of lung cancer was higher among men and the elderly. No significant trend in lung cancer risk across CD4 cell count categories was reported among the selected articles. Our study suggests an increase in the incidence and risk of lung cancer in HIV/AIDS population is worldwide. The effect of HAART on the incidence and risk of lung cancer is in dispute. The risk of lung cancer based on gender differences, especially among females, as well as IDUs, requires further investigation.","incidence and risk of lung cancer in hiv-infected patients. lung cancer is one of the most common non-aids-defining malignancies among hiv-infected patients. the incidence of lung cancer has significantly increased in the hiv-positive population in recent years. the purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence and risk of lung cancer in published population-based studies of people with hiv/aids. published literature from pubmed, embase, the web of science, and google scholar was retrieved. sixty-five publications were selected and assessed for the following parameters: research coverage and location; continent; study period; duration of follow-up; lung cancer cases; hiv cases; incidence rate; and overall sir or adjusted irr. in addition, the risk of lung cancer was compared based on age, gender, hiv exposure category, cd4 count, and periods with highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). lung cancer risk was greater among hiv-infected individuals compared with the general population. sirs or adjusted irrs",incidence risk lung hiv infected lung one common non aid define malignancy among hiv infected incidence lung significantly increase hiv positive population recent year summarize incidence risk lung publish population base people hiv aid publish literature embase web science google scholar retrieve sixty five publication select assess following parameter research coverage location continent period duration follow lung hiv incidence rate overall sir adjust irr addition risk lung compare base age gender hiv exposure category cd count period highly active antiretroviral therapy haart lung risk great among hiv infect individual compare general population sir adjust irrs,c,Lung Cancer

"Lung cancer screening with MRI: Evaluation of MRI for lung cancer screening by comparison of LDCT- and MRI-derived Lung-RADS categories in the first two screening rounds To evaluate MRI for lung cancer screening comparing LDCT- and MRI-derived Lung-RADS categories in the first two screening rounds. 224 participants in a lung cancer screening study were examined with MRI and low-dose CT (LDCT). Acquired MRI sequences were T2, balanced, T1 and DWI. MRI was prospectively analysed regarding nodules. Minimum nodule size was 4 mm. Nodules were assigned a Lung-RADS score based on appearance and size at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. MRI findings were correlated with LDCT. The early recall rate dropped from 13.8% at baseline to 1.9% in the second screening round with biopsy rates of 3.6% in the first round and 0.5% in the second round. Histology revealed lung cancer in 8/9 participants undergoing biopsy/surgery. All eight cancers were accurately depicted by MRI.

"Variation in Adequate Lymph Node Yield for Gastric, Lung, and Bladder Cancer: Attributable to the Surgeon, Pathologist, or Hospital? The Commission on Cancer recently released quality-of-care measures regarding adequate lymphadenectomy for colon, gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. There is currently little information regarding variation in adequate lymph node yield (ALNY) for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. The New York State Cancer Registry and Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System were queried for stage I–III gastric, stage I–II lung, and stage II–III bladder cancer resections from 2004 to 2014. Hierarchical models assessed factors associated with ALNY (gastric ≥ 15; lung ≥ 10; bladder ≥ 2). Additionally, the proportions of variation attributable to surgeons, pathologists, and hospitals were estimated among Medicare patients. Among 3716 gastric, 18,328 lung, and 1512 bladder cancer resections, there were low rates of ALNY (gastric = 53%, lung = 36%, bladder = 67%). When comparing 2004–2006 and 2012–2014, there was significant improvement in ALNY for gastric cancer (39% vs. 68%), but more modest improvement for lung (33% vs. 38%) and bladder (65% vs. 71%) cancer. Large provider-level variation existed for each organ system. After controlling for patient-level factors/variation, the majority of variation was attributable to hospitals (gastric: surgeon = 4%, pathologist = 2.8%, hospital = 40%; lung: surgeon = 13.8%, pathologist = 1.5%, hospital = 18.3%) for gastric and lung cancer. For bladder cancer, most of the variation was attributable to pathologists (surgeon = 3.3%, pathologist = 10.5%, hospital = 6.2%). ALNY rates are low for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer, with only modest improvement over time for lung and bladder cancer. Given that the proportion of variation attributable to the surgeon, pathologist, and hospital is different for each organ system, future quality improvement initiatives should target the underlying causes, which vary by individual organ system.","variation in adequate lymph node yield for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer: attributable to the surgeon, pathologist, or hospital? the commission on cancer recently released quality-of-care measures regarding adequate lymphadenectomy for colon, gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. there is currently little information regarding variation in adequate lymph node yield (alny) for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. the new york state cancer registry and statewide planning and research cooperative system were queried for stage i–iii gastric, stage i–ii lung, and stage ii–iii bladder cancer resections from 2004 to 2014. hierarchical models assessed factors associated with alny (gastric ≥ 15; lung ≥ 10; bladder ≥ 2). additionally, the proportions of variation attributable to surgeons, pathologists, and hospitals were estimated among medicare patients. among 3716 gastric, 18,328 lung, and 1512 bladder cancer resections, there were low rates of alny (gastric = 53%, lung = 36%, bladder = 67%). when comparing 2004–2006 and 2012–2014,",variation adequate lymph node yield gastric lung bladder attributable surgeon pathologist hospital commission recently release quality care measure regard adequate lymphadenectomy colon gastric lung bladder currently little information regard variation adequate lymph node yield alny gastric lung bladder new york state registry statewide planning research cooperative system query stage iii gastric stage ii lung stage ii iii bladder resection hierarchical model assess factor associate alny gastric lung bladder additionally proportion variation attributable surgeon pathologist hospital estimate among medicare among gastric lung bladder resection low rate alny gastric lung bladder comparing,c,Lung Cancer
"A systematic review of the impact of stigma and nihilism on lung cancer outcomes This study systematically reviewed the evidence on the influence of stigma and nihilism on lung cancer patterns of care; patients’ psychosocial and quality of life (QOL) outcomes; and how this may link to public health programs. Medline, EMBASE, ProQuest, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were: included lung cancer patients and/or partners or caregivers and/or health professionals (either at least 80% of participants had lung cancer or were partners or caregivers of lung cancer patients, or there was a lung cancer specific sub-group focus or analysis), assessed stigma or nihilism with respect to lung cancer and published in English between 1st January 1999 and 31st January 2011. Trial quality and levels of evidence were assessed. Eighteen articles describing 15 studies met inclusion criteria. The seven qualitative studies were high quality with regard to data collection, analysis and reporting; however most lacked a clear theoretical framework; did not address interviewer bias; or provide a rationale for sample size. The eight quantitative studies were generally of low quality with highly selected samples, non-comparable groups and low participation rates and employed divergent theoretical and measurement approaches. Stigma about lung cancer was reported by patients and health professionals and was related to poorer QOL and higher psychological distress in patients. Clear empirical explorations of nihilism were not evident. There is qualitative evidence that from the patients’ perspectives public health programs contribute to stigma about lung cancer and this was supported by published commentary. Health-related stigma presents as a part of the lung cancer experience however there are clear limitations in the research to date. Future longitudinal and multi-level research is needed and this should be more clearly linked to relevant theory.","a systematic review of the impact of stigma and nihilism on lung cancer outcomes this study systematically reviewed the evidence on the influence of stigma and nihilism on lung cancer patterns of care; patients’ psychosocial and quality of life (qol) outcomes; and how this may link to public health programs. medline, embase, proquest, cinahl, psycinfo databases were searched. inclusion criteria were: included lung cancer patients and/or partners or caregivers and/or health professionals (either at least 80% of participants had lung cancer or were partners or caregivers of lung cancer patients, or there was a lung cancer specific sub-group focus or analysis), assessed stigma or nihilism with respect to lung cancer and published in english between 1st january 1999 and 31st january 2011. trial quality and levels of evidence were assessed. eighteen articles describing 15 studies met inclusion criteria. the seven qualitative studies were high quality with regard to data collection,",systematic review impact stigma nihilism lung outcomes systematically review evidence influence stigma nihilism lung pattern care psychosocial quality life qol outcome may link public health program medline embase proquest cinahl psycinfo database search inclusion criterion include lung partner caregiver health professional either least participant lung partner caregiver lung lung specific sub group focus assess stigma nihilism respect lung publish english st january st january trial quality level evidence assess eighteen article describe meet inclusion criterion seven qualitative high quality regard data collection,c,Lung Cancer
"Genetic polymorphism of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and the risk of lung cancer. Chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for the development of lung cancer. It has been suggested that genetic susceptibility may contribute to the risk, because only a small portion of smokers develops the disease. Several polymorphisms that involve the metabolic activation or detoxification of carcinogens derived from cigarette smoke have been found to be associated with lung cancer risk. Many studies have focused on the relation between the distribution of polymorphic variants of different forms of the metabolic enzymes and lung cancer susceptibility. In this respect two groups of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, cytochrome P450 (CYP) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), have been discussed.CYP multigene superfamily consists of 10 subfamilies (CYP1-CYP10). A positive association between development of lung cancer and the mutant homozygous genotype ofCYP1A1 gene has been reported in several Japanese populations but such an association has not been observed in either Caucasians or African-Americans. The relation betweenCYP2D6 and lung cancer remains conflicting and inconclusive. Several polymorphisms have been identified at theCYP2E1 locus. No definitive link between the polymorphisms ofCYP2E1 and the risk of lung cancer has, however, been identified. The role of otherCYP2 isoforms in lung carcinogenesis has not been sufficiently investigated.GSTs form a superfamily of genes consisting of five distinct families, namedGSTA, GSTM, GSTP, GSTT andGSTS. The role ofGSTM, GSTT1 orGSTP1 polymorphism in modifying the lung cancer risk may be more limited than has been so far anticipated. Although some genetic polymorphisms discussed here have not shown significant increases/decreases in risk, individuals with differing genotypes may have different susceptibilities to lung cancer. Hopefully, in future studies it will be possible to screen for lung cancer using specific biomarkers.","genetic polymorphism of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and the risk of lung cancer. chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for the development of lung cancer. it has been suggested that genetic susceptibility may contribute to the risk, because only a small portion of smokers develops the disease. several polymorphisms that involve the metabolic activation or detoxification of carcinogens derived from cigarette smoke have been found to be associated with lung cancer risk. many studies have focused on the relation between the distribution of polymorphic variants of different forms of the metabolic enzymes and lung cancer susceptibility. in this respect two groups of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, cytochrome p450 (cyp) and glutathione s-transferases (gsts), have been discussed.cyp multigene superfamily consists of 10 subfamilies (cyp1-cyp10). a positive association between development of lung cancer and the mutant homozygous genotype ofcyp1a1 gene has been reported",genetic polymorphism enzyme involve xenobiotic metabolism risk lung chronic inhalation cigarette smoke major risk factor development lung suggest genetic susceptibility may contribute risk small portion smoker develop several polymorphism involve metabolic activation detoxification carcinogen derive cigarette smoke find associate lung risk many focus relation distribution polymorphic variant different form metabolic enzyme lung susceptibility respect two group genetic polymorphism enzyme involve xenobiotic metabolism cytochrome p cyp glutathione transferase gsts discuss cyp multigene superfamily consist subfamily cyp cyp positive association development lung mutant homozygous genotype ofcyp gene report,c,Lung Cancer
"ZAR1 is a novel epigenetically inactivated tumour suppressor in lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths with 1.8 million new cases each year and poor 5-year prognosis. Promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressors leads to their inactivation and thereby can promote cancer development and progression. In this study, we analysed ZAR1 (zygote arrest 1), which has been said to be a maternal-effect gene and its expression mostly limited to certain reproductive tissues. Our study shows that ZAR1 is expressed in normal lung but inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer. ZAR1 is hypermethylated in primary lung cancer samples (22% small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and 76% non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), p < 0.001) vs. normal control lung tissue (11%). In lung cancer cell lines, ZAR1 was significantly methylated in 75% of SCLC and 83% of NSCLC vs. normal tissue (p < 0.005/0.05). In matching tumours and control tissues, we observed that NSCLC primary tumour samples exhibited a tumour-specific promoter methylation of ZAR1 in comparison to the normal control lung tissue. Demethylation treatment of various lung cancer cell lines reversed ZAR1 promoter hypermethylation and subsequently re-established ZAR1 expression. In addition, we could show the growth inhibitory potential of ZAR1 in lung cancer cell lines and cancer cell lines. Exogenous expression of ZAR1 not only inhibited colony formation but also blocked cell cycle progression of cancer cell lines. Our study shows for the first time the lung tumour-specific epigenetic inactivation of ZAR1 due to DNA methylation of its CpG island promoter. Furthermore, ZAR1 was characterised by the ability to block tumour growth through the inhibition of cell cycle progression in cancer cell lines. We propose that ZAR1 could serve as an epigenetically inactivated biomarker in lung cancer.","zar1 is a novel epigenetically inactivated tumour suppressor in lung cancer lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths with 1.8 million new cases each year and poor 5-year prognosis. promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressors leads to their inactivation and thereby can promote cancer development and progression. in this study, we analysed zar1 (zygote arrest 1), which has been said to be a maternal-effect gene and its expression mostly limited to certain reproductive tissues. our study shows that zar1 is expressed in normal lung but inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer. zar1 is hypermethylated in primary lung cancer samples (22% small cell lung carcinoma (sclc) and 76% non-small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc), p < 0.001) vs. normal control lung tissue (11%). in lung cancer cell lines, zar1 was significantly methylated in 75% of sclc and 83% of nsclc vs. normal tissue (p < 0.005/0.05). in matching tumours and",zar novel epigenetically inactivate suppressor lung lung lead cause relate death million new year poor year prognosis promoter hypermethylation suppressor lead inactivation thereby promote development progression analyse zar zygote arrest say maternal effect gene expression mostly limit certain reproductive tissue show zar express normal lung inactivate promoter methylation lung zar hypermethylated primary lung sample small cell lung carcinoma sclc non small cell lung carcinoma nsclc p v normal control lung tissue lung cell line zar significantly methylated sclc nsclc v normal tissue p match,c,Lung Cancer
"Heterogeneity of multiorgan metastases of human lung cancer cells genetically engineered to produce cytokines and reversal using chimeric monoclonal antibodies in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths, most of which can be attributed to distant multiorgan metastases. To examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis to distant organs, we have established novel models of human lung cancer (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer) metastasis in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We investigated whether local production of the cytokines responsible for regulation of macrophage function at tumor growth sites affects the pattern of lung cancer metastasis in distant organs. Several lung cancer cell lines were genetically engineered to produce human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and their metastatic potentials were assessed. Interestingly, M-CSF gene transduction had an antimetastatic effect for the liver and lymph nodes, but not the kidneys. In contrast, MCP-1 gene-modified lung cancer cells and their parent cells had identical metastatic potentials. These findings indicate a possible role for cyotokines and suggest that lung cancer has metastatic heterogeneity. Examining ways of controlling human lung cancer metastases, we investigated the antimetastatic effect of chimeric monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against P-glycoprotein and ganglioside GM2 (MH162 and KM966, respectively). Both MAbs, when given on days 2 and 7, inhibited the development of distant metastases of lung cancer in a dose-dependent fashion. Combined use of anti-P-glycoprotein MAb with M-CSF or MCP-1 gene transduction caused complete inhibition of metastasis of H69/VP cells. The antimetastatic effect of these MAbs in vivo was mainly due to an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reaction mediated by mouse macrophages. These findings suggest that the mouse-human chimeric MAb in combination with cytokine gene transduction may be useful for the eradication of lung cancer metastases in humans.","heterogeneity of multiorgan metastases of human lung cancer cells genetically engineered to produce cytokines and reversal using chimeric monoclonal antibodies in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths, most of which can be attributed to distant multiorgan metastases. to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis to distant organs, we have established novel models of human lung cancer (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer) metastasis in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice. we investigated whether local production of the cytokines responsible for regulation of macrophage function at tumor growth sites affects the pattern of lung cancer metastasis in distant organs. several lung cancer cell lines were genetically engineered to produce human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), and their metastatic potentials were assessed. interestingly, m-csf gene transduction had an antimetastatic effect for",heterogeneity multiorgan metastasis human lung cell genetically engineer produce cytokine reversal use chimeric monoclonal antibody natural killer cell deplete severe combine immunodeficient mouse lung major cause death attribute distant multiorgan metastasis examine cellular molecular mechanism lung metastasis distant organ establish novel model human lung small cell non small cell lung metastasis natural killer cell deplete severe combine immunodeficient scid mouse investigate whether local production cytokine responsible regulation macrophage function growth sit affect pattern lung metastasis distant organ several lung cell line genetically engineer produce human macrophage colony stimulate factor csf monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp metastatic potential assess interestingly csf gene transduction antimetastatic effect,c,Lung Cancer
"Arachidonic acid suppresses lung cancer cell growth and modulates lipid metabolism and the ERK/PPARγ signaling pathway. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of new treatment strategies. Arachidonic acid (ARA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows promise in cancer therapy due to its potential anti-tumor effects, although its role in lung cancer remains unclear. This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of ARA on A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells. In vitro assays were used to assess cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, lipid droplet formation, and changes in cellular lipid content. ARA dose-dependently suppressed cell viability, facilitated apoptosis, and suppressed colony formation in both lung cancer cell lines. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify potential gene targets and pathways, uncovering 61 overlapping genes between ARA and lung cancer-related targets, with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) emerging as a key gene. Enrichment analyses suggested that the effects of ARA might be mediated through lipid metabolism and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling pathway. In both lung cancer cell lines, ARA treatment inhibited lipid droplet formation and decreased the cellular lipids. Immunoblotting further confirmed that ARA treatment significantly increased ERK phosphorylation while reducing PPARγ and fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. In vitro experiments using GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, confirmed that inhibiting lipid droplet formation impairs lung cancer cell viability and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that ARA significantly reduced tumor size and weight in a lung cancer xenograft model, further validating its anti-tumor effects. The potential of ARA as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer might involve lipid metabolism and relevant signaling pathways. A future study exploring the full therapeutic potential of ARA and underlying mechanisms in lung cancer is needed.","arachidonic acid suppresses lung cancer cell growth and modulates lipid metabolism and the erk/pparγ signaling pathway. lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of new treatment strategies. arachidonic acid (ara), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows promise in cancer therapy due to its potential anti-tumor effects, although its role in lung cancer remains unclear. this study investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of ara on a549 and nci-h1299 lung cancer cells. in vitro assays were used to assess cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, lipid droplet formation, and changes in cellular lipid content. ara dose-dependently suppressed cell viability, facilitated apoptosis, and suppressed colony formation in both lung cancer cell lines. network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify potential gene targets and pathways, uncovering 61 overlapping genes between ara and lung cancer-related targets, with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (mapk1) emerging as a key gene. enrichment analyses suggested",arachidonic acid suppresses lung cell growth modulate lipid metabolism erk ppar signal pathway lung remain lead cause relate mortality worldwide necessitate development new strategy arachidonic acid ara polyunsaturated fatty acid show promise therapy due potential anti effect although role lung remain unclear investigate effect underlie mechanism ara nci h lung cell vitro assay use assess cell viability apoptosis colony formation lipid droplet formation change cellular lipid content ara dose dependently suppress cell viability facilitate apoptosis suppress colony formation lung cell line network pharmacology perform identify potential gene target pathway uncover overlap gene ara lung relate target mitogen activate protein kinase mapk emerge key gene enrichment suggest,c,Lung Cancer
"p53 protein, EGF receptor, and anti-p53 antibodies in serum from patients with occupationally derived lung cancer. The oncogene product epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), the tumour suppressor gene product p53 and anti-p53 antibodies are detectable in the serum of certain cancer patients. Increased levels of some of these products were reported in lung cancer patients after occupational asbestos exposure and after exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or vinylchloride. In the first step, this study investigated the possible diagnostic value of serum EGF-R, p53-protein and anti-p53 antibodies, measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in lung tumour patients. In addition to being investigated on a molecular epidemiological basis, these parameters were examined as biomarkers of carcinogenesis, especially with regard to asbestos incorporation effects or of radon-induced lung cancers. Also, a possible effect of cigarette smoking and age dependence were studied. A total of 116 male patients with lung or pleural tumours were examined. The histological classification was four small-cell cancers, six large-cell cancers, 32 adenocarcinomas, 47 squamous carcinomas, 12 mixed lung carcinomas, five diffuse malignant mesotheliomas and ten lung metastasis of extrapulmonary tumours. Twenty-two lung cancers and all mesotheliomas were related to asbestos, 22 lung cancers were related to ionizing radiation and 61 patients had cigarette smoke-related lung cancer. Besides these patients 50 male patients with non-malignant lung or pleural diseases were included; of the latter eight subjects suffered from asbestosis. Controls were 129 male subjects without any lung disease. No significantly elevated or decreased serum values for p53 protein, EGF-R, or anti-p53 antibodies as a function of histological tumour type, age, or degree and type of exposure (asbestos, smoking, ionizing radiation) could be found.

"Salvage treatment with irinotecan/cisplatin versus pemetrexed/cisplatin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer pre-treated with a non-platinum-based regimen in the first-line setting: a randomized phase II study of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (HORG) Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard front-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, non-platinum combinations of third-generation chemotherapeutic agents are considered an alternative therapeutic option for patients who cannot tolerate the toxic effects of platinum compounds. In this study, the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan plus cisplatin (IC) was compared to pemetrexed plus cisplatin (PC) regimen, in platinum-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, who had been previously treated with the combination of a taxane plus gemcitabine.

The primary endpoint of the study was the overall response rate (ORR). The ORR and median progression-free survival (PFS) in the IC arm were 18 % and 3.3 months, respectively, while in the PC arm were 19 % and 4.2 months (p = ns). Median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in patients with PC (6.9 vs. 10.9; p = 0.013).

In patients with advanced NSCLC pretreated with docetaxel/gemcitabine, the combination of pemetrexed/cisplatin is associated with increased OS and is better tolerated than the combination of irinotecan/cisplatin and should be considered as a valid therapeutic option for platinum-naive, previously treated patients.

"Multi-cohort analysis identifies a blood-based immune transcriptomic signature for early lung cancer detection. Early diagnosis of lung cancer is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality. The immune system and cancer are intricately linked, which provides a unique opportunity to monitor changes in the immune system as a biomarker of cancer development. We collected bulk blood transcriptome from 432 lung cancer cases, 8154 healthy controls, and 14,187 samples with other diseases from 241 datasets for discovery. We also obtained a prospectively enrolled cohort of 371 subjects (172 with lung cancer) and 454 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study (42 with lung cancer) for validation. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of 1,022,063 cells from 260 blood, lymph node, or lung tissue samples from lung cancer patients and other samples across 15 datasets. We performed a multi-cohort blood transcriptome meta-analysis and identified 6 genes consistently differentially expressed between lung cancer and other samples. Using the 6-gene signature, we defined a lung cancer score that was primarily derived from myeloid cells and was consistently higher in tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts than their normal counterparts. In the prospectively enrolled cohort, the diagnostic classifier using the lung cancer score had an AUROC of 0.822 (95% CI: 0.78-0.864) for distinguishing patients with lung cancer from control or benign samples. The classifiers could also potentially reduce the need for additional testing in 37% of patients with benign lung conditions at 90% sensitivity. Importantly, the lung cancer score was also significantly associated with an elevated risk of future lung cancer diagnosis in the Framingham cohort study. Together, we identified a robust blood-based immune gene signature for early detection of lung cancer, which has potential for further clinical development to aid early cancer detection and diagnosis.","multi-cohort analysis identifies a blood-based immune transcriptomic signature for early lung cancer detection. early diagnosis of lung cancer is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality. the immune system and cancer are intricately linked, which provides a unique opportunity to monitor changes in the immune system as a biomarker of cancer development. we collected bulk blood transcriptome from 432 lung cancer cases, 8154 healthy controls, and 14,187 samples with other diseases from 241 datasets for discovery. we also obtained a prospectively enrolled cohort of 371 subjects (172 with lung cancer) and 454 subjects from the framingham heart study (42 with lung cancer) for validation. furthermore, we integrated single-cell rna sequencing profiles of 1,022,063 cells from 260 blood, lymph node, or lung tissue samples from lung cancer patients and other samples across 15 datasets. we performed a multi-cohort blood transcriptome meta-analysis and identified 6 genes consistently differentially expressed between lung cancer",multi cohort identify blood base immune transcriptomic signature early lung detection early diagnosis lung critical timely intervention reduce mortality immune system intricately link provide unique opportunity monitor change immune system biomarker development collect bulk blood transcriptome lung healthy control sample datasets discovery also obtain prospectively enrolled cohort subject lung subject framingham heart lung validation furthermore integrate single cell rna sequence profile cell blood lymph node lung tissue sample lung sample across datasets perform multi cohort blood transcriptome meta identify gene consistently differentially express lung,c,Lung Cancer
"Erratum to: PNA clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis for detecting EGFR and KRAS mutations in the circulating tumor DNA of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is emerging as a surrogate sample type for mutation analyses. To improve the clinical utility of cfDNA, we developed a sensitive peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based method for analyzing EGFR and KRAS mutations in the plasma cfDNA of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Baseline tissue and plasma samples were collected from treatment-naive advanced NSCLC patients participated in a randomized phase II study, which was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov at Feb. 2009 (NCT01003964). EGFR and KRAS mutations in the plasma cfDNA were analyzed retrospectively using a PNA clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis. The results were compared with those obtained from tissue analysis performed using the direct sequencing. Exploratory analyses were performed to determine survival predicted by the plasma and tissue mutation status. Mutation analyses in matched tissue and plasma samples were available for 194 patients for EGFR and 135 patients for KRAS. The mutation concordance rates were 82.0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 76.5–87.4) for EGFR and 85.9 % (95 % CI, 80.1–91.8) for KRAS. The plasma EGFR mutation test sensitivity and specificity were 66.7 % (95 % CI, 60.0–73.3) and 87.4 % (95 % CI, 82.7–92.1), respectively, and the plasma KRAS mutation test sensitivity and specificity were 50.0 % (95 % CI, 41.6–58.4) and 89.4 % (95 % CI, 84.2–94.6), respectively. The predictive value of the plasma EGFR and KRAS mutation status with respect to survival was comparable with that of the tissue mutation status. These data suggest that plasma EGFR and KRAS mutations can be analyzed using PNA-based real-time PCR methods and used as an alternative to tumor genotyping for NSCLC patients when tumor tissue is not available.","erratum to: pna clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis for detecting egfr and kras mutations in the circulating tumor dna of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) is emerging as a surrogate sample type for mutation analyses. to improve the clinical utility of cfdna, we developed a sensitive peptide nucleic acid (pna)-based method for analyzing egfr and kras mutations in the plasma cfdna of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). baseline tissue and plasma samples were collected from treatment-naive advanced nsclc patients participated in a randomized phase ii study, which was registered with clinicaltrials.gov at feb. 2009 (nct01003964). egfr and kras mutations in the plasma cfdna were analyzed retrospectively using a pna clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis. the results were compared with those obtained from tissue analysis performed using the direct sequencing. exploratory analyses were performed to determine survival predicted by the plasma and",erratum pna clamp assisted fluorescence melt curve detect egfr kras mutation circulating dna advanced non small cell lung circulate cell free dna cfdna emerge surrogate sample type mutation improve utility cfdna develop sensitive peptide nucleic acid pna base method analyze egfr kras mutation plasma cfdna advanced non small cell lung nsclc baseline tissue plasma sample collect naive advanced nsclc participate randomized phase ii register clinicaltrials gov feb nct egfr kras mutation plasma cfdna analyze retrospectively use pna clamp assist fluorescence melt curve result compare obtain tissue perform use direct sequencing exploratory perform determine survival predict plasma,c,Lung Cancer
"Basigin-2 upregulated by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand enhances lung cancer-induced osteolytic lesions. Lung cancer bone metastasis causes poor prognosis. Basigin-2, a novel cancer-associated biomarker, is upregulated in lung cancer and has been linked with tumor progression. But little is known about the role of basigin-2 in lung cancer bone metastasis and osteolytic lesion. Basigin-2 expression was evaluated in biopsy tissue specimens of 20 lung cancer patients with bone metastases via immunohistochemistry. Invasion assay and MTT proliferation assay were performed to test the invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cell after modulated basigin-2 expression. The osteoclastic activity of basigin-2 was detected in tibia cancer model by injected of lung cancer cells. The regulation role of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) on basigin-2 and its downstream molecules were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, gelatin zymography and western blot analysis. We found that basigin-2 was highly expressed in lung cancer bone metastases. Then, we demonstrated that basigin-2 could promote lung cancer cells invasion, metastasis and proliferation through upregulating metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. The lung cancer cells overexpressing basigin-2 strongly induced the osteolytic lesions in immunodeficient mice, which were reduced by treatment with basigin-2 blocking antibody. Furthermore, we explored the enhanced basigin-2 molecular mechanism in lung cancer bone metastasis. Our results indicated the RANKL, pivotal for the control of bone resorption, could increase basigin-2 and its downstream molecules MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF expression in vitro. Basigin-2 upregulated by RANKL induces MMPs and VEGF, which may increase lung cancer cell metastasis ability and support osteoclastic activity. Thus, our data suggest important roles for basigin-2 in lung cancer-induced osteolytic lesion and implicate this protein potential application as a target for lung cancer bone metastasis therapy.","basigin-2 upregulated by receptor activator of nf-κb ligand enhances lung cancer-induced osteolytic lesions. lung cancer bone metastasis causes poor prognosis. basigin-2, a novel cancer-associated biomarker, is upregulated in lung cancer and has been linked with tumor progression. but little is known about the role of basigin-2 in lung cancer bone metastasis and osteolytic lesion. basigin-2 expression was evaluated in biopsy tissue specimens of 20 lung cancer patients with bone metastases via immunohistochemistry. invasion assay and mtt proliferation assay were performed to test the invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cell after modulated basigin-2 expression. the osteoclastic activity of basigin-2 was detected in tibia cancer model by injected of lung cancer cells. the regulation role of receptor activator of nf-κb ligand (rankl) on basigin-2 and its downstream molecules were measured by real-time quantitative rt-pcr, gelatin zymography and western blot analysis. we found that basigin-2 was highly expressed in lung cancer bone",basigin upregulated receptor activator nf b ligand enhances lung induce osteolytic lesion lung bone metastasis cause poor prognosis basigin novel associate biomarker upregulated lung link progression little know role basigin lung bone metastasis osteolytic lesion basigin expression evaluate biopsy tissue specimen lung bone metastasis via immunohistochemistry invasion assay mtt proliferation assay perform test invasion proliferation lung cell modulate basigin expression osteoclastic activity basigin detect tibia model inject lung cell regulation role receptor activator nf b ligand rankl basigin downstream molecule measure real time quantitative rt pcr gelatin zymography western blot find basigin highly express lung bone,c,Lung Cancer
"Characteristics of lung cancer among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease - analysis of institutional and population data. Lung Cancer is occasionally observed in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). We sought to describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of lung cancer for patients with IPF and other interstitial lung disease (ILD) using institutional and statewide data registries. We conducted a retrospective analysis of IPF and non-IPF ILD patients from the ILD center registry, to compare with lung cancer registries at the University of Pittsburgh as well as with population data of lung cancer obtained from Pennsylvania Department of Health between 2000 and 2015. Among 1108 IPF patients, 31 patients were identified with IPF and lung cancer. The age-adjusted standard incidence ratio of lung cancer was 3.34 (with IPF) and 2.3 (with non-IPF ILD) (between-group Hazard ratio = 1.4, p = 0.3). Lung cancer worsened the mortality of IPF (p <  0.001). Lung cancer with IPF had higher mortality compared to lung cancer in non-IPF ILD (Hazard ratio = 6.2, p = 0.001). Lung cancer among IPF was characterized by a predilection for lower lobes (63% vs. 26% in non-IPF lung cancer, p <  0.001) and by squamous cell histology (41% vs. 29%, p = 0.07). Increased incidence of lung cancer was observed among single lung transplant (SLT) recipients for IPF (13 out of 97, 13.4%), with increased mortality compared to SLT for IPF without lung cancer (p = 0.028) during observational period. Lung cancer is approximately 3.34 times more frequently diagnosed in IPF patients compared to general population, and associated with worse prognosis compared with IPF without lung cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma and lower lobe predilection. The causality between non-smoking IPF patients and lung cancer is to be determined.","characteristics of lung cancer among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease - analysis of institutional and population data. lung cancer is occasionally observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). we sought to describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of lung cancer for patients with ipf and other interstitial lung disease (ild) using institutional and statewide data registries. we conducted a retrospective analysis of ipf and non-ipf ild patients from the ild center registry, to compare with lung cancer registries at the university of pittsburgh as well as with population data of lung cancer obtained from pennsylvania department of health between 2000 and 2015. among 1108 ipf patients, 31 patients were identified with ipf and lung cancer. the age-adjusted standard incidence ratio of lung cancer was 3.34 (with ipf) and 2.3 (with non-ipf ild) (between-group hazard ratio = 1.4, p = 0.3). lung cancer worsened the mortality",characteristic lung among idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis interstitial lung institutional population data lung occasionally observe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf seek describe epidemiologic characteristic lung ipf interstitial lung ild use institutional statewide data registry conduct retrospective ipf non ipf ild ild center registry compare lung registry university pittsburgh well population data lung obtain pennsylvania department health among ipf identify ipf lung age adjust standard incidence ratio lung ipf non ipf ild group hazard ratio p lung worsen mortality,c,Lung Cancer
"Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies ITGA8 responsible for abivertinib sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma. The emergence of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has improved the prognosis for lung cancer patients with EGFR-driven mutations. However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs poses a significant challenge to the treatment. Overcoming the resistance has primarily focused on developing next-generation targeted therapies based on the molecular mechanisms of resistance or inhibiting the activation of bypass pathways to suppress or reverse the resistance. In this study we developed a novel approach by using CRISPR-Cas9 whole-genome library screening to identify the genes that enhance the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma cells to EGFR-TKIs. Through this screening, we revealed integrin subunit alpha 8 (ITGA8) as the key gene that enhanced sensitivity to abivertinib in lung adenocarcinoma. Notably, ITGA8 expression was significantly downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that ITGA8 was positively correlated with the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma to abivertinib. We showed that knockdown of ITGA8 significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of H1975 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ITGA8 reduced the proliferation migration and invasion of H1975/ABIR cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ITGA8 sensitized lung adenocarcinoma cells to EGFR-TKIs by attenuating the downstream FAK/SRC/AKT/MAPK signaling pathway. In H1975 cell xenograft mouse models, knockdown of ITGA8 significantly increased tumor growth and reduced the sensitivity to abivertinib, whereas overexpression of ITGA8 markedly suppressed tumor proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to the drug. This study demonstrates that ITGA8 inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells, enhances the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, improves treatment efficacy, and delays the progression of acquired resistance. Thus, ITGA8 presents a potential therapeutic candidate for addressing acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs from a novel perspective.","genome-wide crispr-cas9 screening identifies itga8 responsible for abivertinib sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma. the emergence of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (egfr-tkis) has improved the prognosis for lung cancer patients with egfr-driven mutations. however, acquired resistance to egfr-tkis poses a significant challenge to the treatment. overcoming the resistance has primarily focused on developing next-generation targeted therapies based on the molecular mechanisms of resistance or inhibiting the activation of bypass pathways to suppress or reverse the resistance. in this study we developed a novel approach by using crispr-cas9 whole-genome library screening to identify the genes that enhance the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma cells to egfr-tkis. through this screening, we revealed integrin subunit alpha 8 (itga8) as the key gene that enhanced sensitivity to abivertinib in lung adenocarcinoma. notably, itga8 expression was significantly downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. bioinformatics analyses revealed that itga8 was positively correlated",genome wide crispr ca screen identifies itga responsible abivertinib sensitivity lung adenocarcinoma emergence epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor egfr tkis improve prognosis lung egfr driven mutation however acquire resistance egfr tkis pose significant challenge overcome resistance primarily focus develop next generation target therapy base molecular mechanism resistance inhibit activation bypass pathway suppress reverse resistance develop novel approach use crispr cas whole genome library screen identify gene enhance sensitivity lung adenocarcinoma cell egfr tkis screening reveal integrin subunit alpha itga key gene enhance sensitivity abivertinib lung adenocarcinoma notably itga expression significantly downregulated lung adenocarcinoma tissue compare adjacent normal tissue bioinformatics reveal itga positively correlate,c,Lung Cancer
"Angiomotin-p130 inhibits vasculogenic mimicry formation of small cell lung cancer independently of Smad2/3 signal pathway. Lung cancer, the most concerning malignancy worldwide and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Growing evidence indicates that Angiomotin (Amot)-p130 plays an important role in types of cancer, including breast cancer and gastric cancer. Moreover, evidence suggested that the low Amot-p130 expression correlates with the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, however, the role and mechanism of Amot-p130 in lung cancer is still unclear. In this study, we showed that Amot-p130 expression was reduced in lung cancer tissues, compared with the adjacent para-carcinoma tissues. In addition, we observed that the reduced expression of Amot-p130 was associated with vasculogenic mimicry (VM) channels formation in lung cancer tissues. Amot-p130 expression was differently expression in lung cancer cell line H446, H1688 and H2227 compared with the normal human lung cells HFL1. To clarify the role of Amot-p130 in lung cancer, we constructed the Amot-p130 expressing H446 cells and Amot-p130 silencing H1299 cells. We confirmed that Amot-p130 overexpression inhibited the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, whereas its silence promoted cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, we also found that Amot-p130 overexpression suppressed VM tube formation in H446 cells, while its knockdown promoted VM tube formation in H2227 cells. Further studies suggested that Amot-p130 plays roles in M tube formation of lung cancer cell V are independent on smad2/3 signaling pathway. Finally, inoculation of Amot-p130 expressing H446 cells and Amot-p130 silencing H1299 cells into nude mice suppressed tumor growth, when compared with the control group. Based on these results, Amot-p130 serves as a possible diagnostic and therapeutic target in lung cancer patients, and may be an effective mediator of VM formation in lung cancer.","angiomotin-p130 inhibits vasculogenic mimicry formation of small cell lung cancer independently of smad2/3 signal pathway. lung cancer, the most concerning malignancy worldwide and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. growing evidence indicates that angiomotin (amot)-p130 plays an important role in types of cancer, including breast cancer and gastric cancer. moreover, evidence suggested that the low amot-p130 expression correlates with the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, however, the role and mechanism of amot-p130 in lung cancer is still unclear. in this study, we showed that amot-p130 expression was reduced in lung cancer tissues, compared with the adjacent para-carcinoma tissues. in addition, we observed that the reduced expression of amot-p130 was associated with vasculogenic mimicry (vm) channels formation in lung cancer tissues. amot-p130 expression was differently expression in lung cancer cell line h446, h1688 and h2227 compared with the normal human lung cells hfl1. to clarify the role of",angiomotin p inhibit vasculogenic mimicry formation small cell lung independently smad signal pathway lung concerning malignancy worldwide one leading cause relate death grow evidence indicate angiomotin amot p play important role type include breast gastric moreover evidence suggest low amot p expression correlate poor prognosis lung however role mechanism amot p lung still unclear show amot p expression reduce lung tissue compare adjacent para carcinoma tissue addition observe reduced expression amot p associate vasculogenic mimicry vm channel formation lung tissue amot p expression differently expression lung cell line h h h compare normal human lung cell hfl clarify role,c,Lung Cancer
"The Effect of Artificial Neural Network Model Combined with Six Tumor Markers in Auxiliary Diagnosis of Lung Cancer To evaluate the diagnosis potential of artificial neural network (ANN) model combined with six tumor markers in auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer, to differentiate lung cancer from lung benign disease, normal control, and gastrointestinal cancers.

"Targetable ""driver"" mutations in non small cell lung cancer. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world despite advances in the field of cancer therapeutics. Traditional treatment with empirically chosen cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, have given small, but real survival benefits. Recent advances and insights into molecular pathogenesis of lung cancers have provided some novel molecular targets, offering newer strategies and agents that are tumor specific. Studies have identified mutations in specific genes that are involved in driving the development of lung cancer and so it is important to subsequently target them with specific drugs thus changing paradigms of management of this type of cancer. Recently, Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) has identified at least one of the many recognized “driver mutations” in nearly two thirds of the patients with advanced cancer. This study suggests that identification of driver mutations can help in molecular targeted therapeutics and in addition supplant tumor histology in guiding treatment decisions, identifying subset of patients who may benefit therapy. This review focuses on these mutations identified in specific genes serving as “drivers” of lung tumorigenesis and suggests that clear promise for the future of lung cancer treatment is indeed personalized therapy with drugs chosen according to the patient mutation profile. Most clinically relevant translational advances made in genes involved in lung tumorigenesis namely EML4-ALK fusions, HER2, PIK3CA, AKT, BRAF, MAP2K1, MET mutations and amplifications along with the well established EGFR and KRAS mutations are discussed in the context of NSCLCs. These studies emphasize the need for treatment management based on mutation profile along with routine histology based classification of these tumors in future for a directed therapy and thus a better therapeutic outcome.","targetable ""driver"" mutations in non small cell lung cancer. lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world despite advances in the field of cancer therapeutics. traditional treatment with empirically chosen cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, have given small, but real survival benefits. recent advances and insights into molecular pathogenesis of lung cancers have provided some novel molecular targets, offering newer strategies and agents that are tumor specific. studies have identified mutations in specific genes that are involved in driving the development of lung cancer and so it is important to subsequently target them with specific drugs thus changing paradigms of management of this type of cancer. recently, lung cancer mutation consortium (lcmc) has identified at least one of the many recognized “driver mutations” in nearly two thirds of the patients with advanced cancer. this study suggests that identification of driver mutations can help in molecular targeted therapeutics and",targetable driver mutation non small cell lung lung remain lead cause relate mortality world despite advance field therapeutic traditional empirically choose cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent give small real survival benefit recent advance insight molecular pathogenesis lung provide novel molecular target offer new strategy agent specific identify mutation specific gene involve drive development lung important subsequently target specific drug thus change paradigm management type recently lung mutation consortium lcmc identify least one many recognize driver mutation nearly two third advanced suggest identification driver mutation help molecular target therapeutic,c,Lung Cancer
"Histological classification and TNM staging of lung cancer BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of lung cancer comprises a variety of different histological types and clinical situations. METHODS: Review of the recent literature. RESULTS: Generally, primary lung carcinomas are classified according to the best differentiated component following WHO criteria and are graded according to the worst differentiated component. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are all those lung carcinomas without evidence of small cell lung cancer. Depending on tumour size, more than 50% of lung carcinomas contain more than one of the histological types of the main representatives of NSCLC. However, minor portions are not included in the classification. Main representatives, with a prevalence of more than 90%, are squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. About 80% of lung carcinomas are assigned to the group of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 20% are small cell lung cancers (SCLC). Of NSCLC, the group of adenocarcinomas is steadily increasing and currently amounts to 40%, squamous cell carcinomas also amount to 40%, the rest are large cell carcinomas and other rare tumour types. The pathologist establishes the diagnosis of a clinically suspected malignant tumour from biopsy material, especially considering dignity, differentiation between primary lung carcinoma and metastasis, classification and tumour type with particularly meticulous differentiation between small cell carcinoma and NSCLC. Intraoperative frozen section directly determines further surgical procedure. Pathological examination of the resected specimen provides current pTNM classification and thereby determines further prognosis and therapy. The newly revised WHO histopathologic classification of lung cancer, international TNM Staging System for Lung Cancer as well as stage groupings are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Stage and histopathologic type determine appropriate treatment and prognosis of lung cancer.","histological classification and tnm staging of lung cancer background: the diagnosis of lung cancer comprises a variety of different histological types and clinical situations. methods: review of the recent literature. results: generally, primary lung carcinomas are classified according to the best differentiated component following who criteria and are graded according to the worst differentiated component. non-small cell lung cancers (nsclc) are all those lung carcinomas without evidence of small cell lung cancer. depending on tumour size, more than 50% of lung carcinomas contain more than one of the histological types of the main representatives of nsclc. however, minor portions are not included in the classification. main representatives, with a prevalence of more than 90%, are squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. about 80% of lung carcinomas are assigned to the group of non-small cell lung cancers (nsclc), 20% are small cell lung cancers (sclc). of",histological classification tnm staging lung diagnosis lung comprise variety different histological type situation method review recent literature result generally primary lung carcinoma classify accord best differentiated component follow criterion grade accord bad differentiated component non small cell lung nsclc lung carcinoma without evidence small cell lung depend size lung carcinoma contain one histological type main representative nsclc however minor portion include classification main representative prevalence squamous cell carcinoma small cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma large cell carcinoma lung carcinoma assign group non small cell lung nsclc small cell lung sclc,c,Lung Cancer

"The risk of a second primary lung cancer after a first invasive breast cancer according to estrogen receptor status. Lung cancers account for 5 % of second primary cancers after breast cancer. The low overall 5-year relative survival rate of lung cancer makes it a particularly concerning new malignancy for breast cancer survivors. It is unknown whether second lung cancer risk varies by estrogen receptor (ER) expression of the first breast cancer. We evaluated second primary lung cancer risks using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)) among 222,148 one-year breast cancer survivors in the NCI-SEER Program registry database (1992–2008). Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % CIs for lung cancer following ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer were estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for age, year, and stage of breast cancer diagnosis, attained age, latency, and radiotherapy. We also examined the reciprocal association of second ER− and ER+ breast cancers among 28,107 1-year lung cancer survivors. There were 418 and 1,444 second lung cancers diagnosed following 50,781 ER− and 171,367 ER+ breast cancers. Second lung cancer rates were significantly elevated after ER− (SIR = 1.20 (1.09–1.33)), but not ER+ (SIR = 0.96 (0.91–1.01)) breast cancer. The adjusted RR for a second lung cancer following ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer was 1.22 (1.10–1.37). The reciprocal adjusted RR for a second ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer following lung cancer was 1.29 (0.98–1.70). The parallel increase for a second lung cancer following an ER− first breast cancer and for a second ER− breast cancer after a first lung cancer suggests that there may be shared etiologic factors for these cancers.

"Risk patterns of lung cancer mortality in northern Thailand. Over the past decade, lung cancers have exhibited a disproportionately high mortality and increasing mortality trend in Thailand, especially in the northern region, and prevention strategies have consequently become more important in this region. Spatial analysis studies may be helpful in guiding any strategy put in place to respond to the risk of lung cancer mortality in specific areas. The aim of our study was to identify risk patterns for lung cancer mortality within the northern region of Thailand. In the spatial analysis, the relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of the risk of lung cancer mortality in 81 districts of northern Thailand between 2008 and 2017.

The overall risk of lung cancer mortality was the highest in the west of northern Thailand, especially in the Hang Dong, Doi Lo, and San Pa Tong districts. For both genders, the risk patterns of lung cancer mortality indicated a high risk in the west of northern Thailand, with females being at a higher risk than males. There was distinct geographical variation in risk patterns of lung cancer mortality in Thailand. Differences could be related to differences in risk factors such as ground-based radon and air pollution.

We studied 1263 people from 97 families enrolled in a cohort study of families systematically ascertained through childhood soft-tissue sarcoma patients treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, between 1944 and 1975. We assessed the incidence of lung and smoking-related cancers in 33 carriers of germline p53 mutations and in 1,230 noncarriers to determine whether there was an association between an inherited cancer predisposition, cigarette smoking, and cancer risk. We analyzed the association between cigarette smoking, mutation status, and lung and other smoking-related cancers by the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model with adjustments for birth year, race, and sex. In the hazards model, we incorporated a robust variance estimation to adjust for familial correlation. We observed an increased risk of a variety of histological types of lung cancer in the carriers of the p53 germline mutation. Mutation carriers who smoked had a 3.16-fold (95% confidence interval =1.48-6.78) higher risk for lung cancer than the mutation carriers who did not smoke. Our results demonstrate that cigarette smoking significantly increases lung cancer risk in carriers of a germline p53 mutation. This finding could be useful in designing strategies for early detection and treatment of lung and smoking-related cancers in individuals with this inherited cancer predisposition.","lung cancer risk in germline p53 mutation carriers: association between an inherited cancer predisposition, cigarette smoking, and cancer risk we recently observed a significantly increased risk for lung cancer in carriers of p53 germline mutations. because cigarette smoking is known to play an important role in increasing the risk for lung cancer in the general population, we wanted to determine the role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer risk in people with a genetic susceptibility based on a p53 germline mutation. we studied 1263 people from 97 families enrolled in a cohort study of families systematically ascertained through childhood soft-tissue sarcoma patients treated at the m.d. anderson cancer center, university of texas, between 1944 and 1975. we assessed the incidence of lung and smoking-related cancers in 33 carriers of germline p53 mutations and in 1,230 noncarriers to determine whether there was an association between an inherited cancer predisposition, cigarette smoking,",lung risk germline p mutation carrier association inherited predisposition cigarette smoking risk recently observe significantly increase risk lung carrier p germline mutation cigarette smoking know play important role increase risk lung general population want determine role cigarette smoking lung risk people genetic susceptibility base p germline mutation people family enrol cohort family systematically ascertain childhood soft tissue sarcoma treat anderson center university texas assess incidence lung smoking related carrier germline p mutation noncarriers determine whether association inherited predisposition cigarette smoking,c,Lung Cancer
"Oct4 promotes M2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in lung cancer Expression of Oct4 maintains cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in lung cancer cells and is correlated with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote cancer cell migration and metastasis. Tumor microenvironments promote monocyte differentiation into M2 TAMs via a complex cytokine-based connection. We explored the role of Oct4 in cytokine secretion in lung cancer and its impact on M2 TAM polarization. Monocytes co-cultured with the conditioned medium from Oct4-overexpressing lung cancer cells were used to investigate M2 TAM differentiation. The inflammatory factors in the conditioned medium of Oct4-overexpressing A549 cells were examined using human inflammation antibody arrays. The correlations of Oct4, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and M2 TAMs were validated in lung cancer cells, syngeneic mouse lung tumor models, and clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Oct4-overexpressing A549 cells expressed elevated levels of M-CSF, which contributed to increased M2 macrophages and enhanced tumor migration. Overexpression of Oct4 enhanced tumor growth and reduced the survival of lung tumor-bearing mice, which was correlated with increased number of M2 macrophages in lung cancer. Notably, NSCLC patients with high expression levels of Oct4, M-CSF, and M2 TAMs had the poorest recurrence-free survival. A positive correlation between Oct4, M-CSF, and M2 TAMs was observed in the tumor tissue of NSCLC patient. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid exerted anti-tumor effects and reduced M2 TAMs in tumor-bearing mice. Our results indicate that Oct4 expressed by lung cancer cells promotes M2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of M-CSF secretion, leading to cancer growth and metastasis. Our findings also implicate that the Oct4/M-CSF axis in M2 macrophage polarization may be potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer.","oct4 promotes m2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in lung cancer expression of oct4 maintains cancer stem cell (csc)-like properties in lung cancer cells and is correlated with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. m2-type tumor-associated macrophages (tams) promote cancer cell migration and metastasis. tumor microenvironments promote monocyte differentiation into m2 tams via a complex cytokine-based connection. we explored the role of oct4 in cytokine secretion in lung cancer and its impact on m2 tam polarization. monocytes co-cultured with the conditioned medium from oct4-overexpressing lung cancer cells were used to investigate m2 tam differentiation. the inflammatory factors in the conditioned medium of oct4-overexpressing a549 cells were examined using human inflammation antibody arrays. the correlations of oct4, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf), and m2 tams were validated in lung cancer cells, syngeneic mouse lung tumor models, and clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). oct4-overexpressing a549 cells expressed elevated",oct promote macrophage polarization upregulation macrophage colony stimulate factor lung expression oct maintains stem cell csc like property lung cell correlate poor prognosis lung adenocarcinoma type associate macrophage tams promote cell migration metastasis microenvironments promote monocyte differentiation tam via complex cytokine base connection explore role oct cytokine secretion lung impact tam polarization monocytes co culture conditioned medium oct overexpressing lung cell use investigate tam differentiation inflammatory factor conditioned medium oct overexpressing cell examine use human inflammation antibody array correlation oct macrophage colony stimulate factor csf tam validate lung cell syngeneic mouse lung model sample non small cell lung nsclc oct overexpressing cell express elevate,c,Lung Cancer
"Local and systemic neutrophilic inflammation in patients with lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Recent investigations suggest that neutrophils play an important role in the immune response to lung cancer as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of neutrophils and markers of their activity in lung cancer and COPD and in coexistence of these two diseases. In total, 267 persons were included in the study: 139 patients with lung cancer, 55 patients with lung cancer and COPD, 40 patients with COPD, and 33 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood and BAL fluid samples were obtained for cell count analysis and determination of NE, MPO levels and ROS production. NE and MPO levels in the serum and BAL fluid were determined by ELISA. ROS production was analyzed by flow cytometer. The percentage, cell count of neutrophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral blood were significantly higher in lung cancer patients with or without COPD compared to COPD patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.05). The percentage and cell count of neutrophils in BAL fluid were significantly lower in patients with lung cancer with or without COPD than in patients with COPD (P < 0.05). However, BAL fluid and serum levels of both NE and MPO were significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than COPD patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Neutrophils produced higher amounts of ROS in patients with lung cancer with or without COPD compared with COPD patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.05).

"Association between environmental tobacco smoke exposure and lung cancer susceptibility: modification by antioxidant enzyme genetic polymorphisms. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the primary etiologic factor responsible for lung cancer. However, only 10–15 % of smokers develop lung cancer, suggesting a genetic role in modifying individual susceptibility to lung cancer. Antioxidant enzymes and genetic polymorphisms should be considered. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of antioxidant enzyme activity and genetic polymorphisms in modifying the susceptibility to lung cancer among individuals exposed to ETS. A total of 150 male subjects were divided into three groups: 50 lung cancer patients, 50 chronic smokers, and 50 passive smokers. Genotyping of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) exon 3 (Tyr113Hist) and exon 4 (Hist139Arg) polymorphisms were done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. MnSOD (Val16Ala) polymorphism was detected by the real time-TaqMan assay. Erythrocyte MnSOD activity was measured spectrophotometrically. ETS-exposed individuals (both active and passive smokers) who carried the His allele of mEH exon3 have a 2.9-fold increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] 2.9, P < 0.001). In addition, ETS-exposed carriers of the Arg allele of mEH exon 4 have a 2.1-fold increased risk of lung cancer (OR 2.1, P = 0.024). However, no association between the MnSOD Val16Ala polymorphism and lung cancer was detected among ETS-exposed individuals (OR 1.6, P = 0.147), although the lung cancer group had significantly lower MnSOD activity than the chronic or passive smoker groups (P = 0.03). Exons 3 and 4 polymorphisms of the mEH gene may contribute to lung cancer susceptibility through disturbed antioxidant balance. However, this was not the case with the MnSOD Val16Ala single-nucleotid polymorphism. Antioxidant enzymes may modulate the influence of ETS exposure on lung cancer risk.","association between environmental tobacco smoke exposure and lung cancer susceptibility: modification by antioxidant enzyme genetic polymorphisms. environmental tobacco smoke (ets) is the primary etiologic factor responsible for lung cancer. however, only 10–15 % of smokers develop lung cancer, suggesting a genetic role in modifying individual susceptibility to lung cancer. antioxidant enzymes and genetic polymorphisms should be considered. the present study aimed to evaluate the role of antioxidant enzyme activity and genetic polymorphisms in modifying the susceptibility to lung cancer among individuals exposed to ets. a total of 150 male subjects were divided into three groups: 50 lung cancer patients, 50 chronic smokers, and 50 passive smokers. genotyping of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (meh) exon 3 (tyr113hist) and exon 4 (hist139arg) polymorphisms were done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. mnsod (val16ala) polymorphism was detected by the real time-taqman assay. erythrocyte mnsod activity was measured spectrophotometrically. ets-exposed individuals (both",association environmental tobacco smoke exposure lung susceptibility modification antioxidant enzyme genetic polymorphism environmental tobacco smoke ets primary etiologic factor responsible lung however smoker develop lung suggest genetic role modify individual susceptibility lung antioxidant enzyme genetic polymorphism consider present evaluate role antioxidant enzyme activity genetic polymorphism modify susceptibility lung among individual expose ets total male subject divide three group lung chronic smoker passive smoker genotyping microsomal epoxide hydrolase meh exon tyr hist exon hist arg polymorphism polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism technique mnsod val ala polymorphism detect real time taqman assay erythrocyte mnsod activity measure spectrophotometrically ets expose individual,c,Lung Cancer
"Emodin regulated lactate metabolism by inhibiting MCT1 to delay non-small cell lung cancer progression. Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, with high incidence rate and mortality. Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 has been found to be widely expressed in various tumors and plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism. Emodin, as an important traditional Chinese medicine in China, has been reported to inhibit the progression of lung cancer. However, its potential mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The effects of emodin and MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells were detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound-healing assay, and transwell small chamber assay. The content of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in the cell culture medium was detected using a glucose, lactate, and pyruvate detection kit, and also detected protein expression using western blotting. In addition, to investigate the effects of emodin and AZD3965 on lung cancer in vivo, we constructed nude mice subcutaneous transplant tumor model by subcutaneous injection of lung cancer cells. The results showed that emodin and AZD3965 could inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells. At the same time, they could inhibit the expression of MCT1 in lung cancer cells and promote the release of lactate, but did not affect the content of glucose and pyruvate. In vivo experiments had shown that emodin and AZD3965 could effectively inhibit the growth of lung cancer and inhibit the expression of MCT1. All in all, our data suggested that emodin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells, possibly by inhibiting MCT1, providing important theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism of emodin in treating lung cancer.","emodin regulated lactate metabolism by inhibiting mct1 to delay non-small cell lung cancer progression. lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, with high incidence rate and mortality. monocarboxylate transporter (mct) 1 has been found to be widely expressed in various tumors and plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism. emodin, as an important traditional chinese medicine in china, has been reported to inhibit the progression of lung cancer. however, its potential mechanism has not been fully elucidated. the effects of emodin and mct1 inhibitor azd3965 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells were detected using cell counting kit-8 (cck-8) assay, wound-healing assay, and transwell small chamber assay. the content of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in the cell culture medium was detected using a glucose, lactate, and pyruvate detection kit, and also detected protein expression using western blotting. in addition, to",emodin regulate lactate metabolism inhibit mct delay non small cell lung progression lung one common malignant world high incidence rate mortality monocarboxylate transporter mct find widely express various play crucial role regulate energy metabolism emodin important traditional chinese medicine china report inhibit progression lung however potential mechanism fully elucidate effect emodin mct inhibitor azd proliferation migration invasion lung cell detect use cell count kit cck assay wound heal assay transwell small chamber assay content glucose lactate pyruvate cell culture medium detect use glucose lactate pyruvate detection kit also detect protein expression use western blotting addition,c,Lung Cancer
"Relationship between lung function and lung cancer risk: a pooled analysis of cohorts plus Mendelian randomization study. Since little consensus has been reached on whether milder reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) increases lung cancer incidence, we conducted a meta-analysis and performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the association and causal relationship between FEV1 and lung cancer incidence. We conducted a comprehensive search from PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases as of February 2020. MR analysis was performed using summary data obtained from two large consortia [International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and Neale Lab] to assess the possible causality between FEV1 and lung cancer risk. Eight studies involving 88,743 cases were included. The incidence of lung cancer increased with decreasing FEV1.The combined odds ratio (OR) of decreased FEV1 for lung cancer incidence was 1.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67–2.19; P   100% of predicted), the OR was 3.06 (95% CI 2.20–4.24; P < 0.001) for quintile 1 (< 70% of predicted), 1.89 (95% CI 1.50–2.38; P < 0.001) for quintile 2 (70–80% of predicted), 1.53 (95% CI 1.31–1.79; P < 0.001) for quintile 3 (80–90% of predicted), and 1.64 (95% CI 1.18–2.28; P = 0.003) for quintile 4 (90–100% of predicted). In subgroup meta-analysis, the correlation between FEV1 and lung cancer risk was different among men (OR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.49–2.03; P < 0.001) and women (OR = 2.80; 95% CI 1.87–4.19; P < 0.001). However, MR analysis showed no causality between the FEV1 and lung cancer risk (OR = 1.199; 95% CI 0.958–1.500; P = 0.114). FEV1 is likely to be a predictor of lung cancer, especially for women.

"Twenty-eight-day mortality in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the emergency department. Few data are available regarding treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the emergency department (ED). We aimed to evaluate 28-day mortality in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED. Patients with solid malignancy who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED of a tertiary hospital were retrospectively identified and stratified into four groups according to the presence of lung cancer and metastasis. Among 212 included patients, the mortality rates by the 28th hospital day were as follows: 44.2% (19/43) in non-lung cancer patients without metastasis, 63.2% (43/68) in non-lung cancer patients with metastasis, 52.4% (11/21) in lung cancer patients without metastasis, and 66.2% (53/80) in lung cancer patients with metastasis. In multivariable analysis, lung cancer patients with metastasis had significantly higher odds ratio for 28-day mortality than non-lung cancer patients without metastasis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 7.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.14–24.01).

In conclusion, the treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED were poor.

The risk of lung cancer for patients with SPN is higher in clinical populations than in screening studies. Moreover, patients with SPN showed lower mortality than those without SPN. • Lung cancer risk is 8 % for SPN detected on routine radiographs.;  • Lung cancer risk is 12.4 % for SPN detected in routine chest CT.;  • Smoking, COPD, SPN diameter and edge were predictors of malignancy.;  • Lung cancer risk of SPN in routine practice seems higher than in screening.","lung cancer risk and cancer-specific mortality in subjects undergoing routine imaging test when stratified with and without identified lung nodule on imaging study to assess the risk of lung cancer and specific mortality rate in patients with and without solitary pulmonary nodules (spn) on chest radiograph and ct. this prospective study included 16,078 patients ≥35 years old (893 of them had an spn detected with either chest radiograph or ct) and 15,185 without spn. patients were followed up for 18 months or until being diagnosed with lung cancer. risk and mortality lung cancer were calculated in both groups with poisson regression. in patients with spn, incidence of lung cancer was 8.3 % (95 % ci 6.0–11.2) on radiograph and 12.4 % (95 % ci 9.3–15.9) on ct. a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with radiographs (odds ratio 2.62; 95 % ci 1.03, 6.67) and smoking habit (odds ratio 20.63;",lung risk specific mortality subject undergoing routine image test stratify without identify lung nodule image assess risk lung specific mortality rate without solitary pulmonary nodule spn chest radiograph ct prospective include year old spn detect either chest radiograph ct without spn follow month diagnose lung risk mortality lung calculate group poisson regression spn incidence lung ci radiograph ci ct chronic obstructive pulmonary radiographs odds ratio ci smoking habit odds ratio,c,Lung Cancer
"Lung Cancer Stem Cells and Implications for Future Therapeutics Lung cancer is the most dreaded of all cancers because of the higher mortality rates associated with it worldwide. The various subtypes of lung cancer respond differently to a particular treatment regime, which makes the therapeutic interventions all the more complicated. The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is based primarily on the clinical and experimental observations that indicate the existence of a subpopulation of cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate as well as show increased resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. They are considered as the factors responsible for the cases of tumor relapse. The CSCs may have significant role in the development of lung tumorigenesis based on the identification of the CSCs which respond during injury. The properties of multi-potency and self-renewal are shared in common by the lung CSCs with the normal pluripotent stem cells which can be isolated using the similar markers. This review deals with the origin and characteristics of the lung cancer stem cells. The role of different markers used to isolate lung CSCs like CD44, ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase), CD133 and ABCG2 (ATP binding cassette sub family G member 2) have been discussed in detail. Analysis of the developmental signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, hedgehog in the regulation and maintenance of the lung CSCs have been done. Finally, before targeting the lung CSC biomarkers for potential therapeutics, challenges faced in lung cancer stem cell research need to be taken into account. With the accepted notion that the CSCs are to blame for cancer relapse and drug resistance, targeting them can be an important aspect of lung cancer therapy in the future.","lung cancer stem cells and implications for future therapeutics lung cancer is the most dreaded of all cancers because of the higher mortality rates associated with it worldwide. the various subtypes of lung cancer respond differently to a particular treatment regime, which makes the therapeutic interventions all the more complicated. the concept of cancer stem cells (cscs) is based primarily on the clinical and experimental observations that indicate the existence of a subpopulation of cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate as well as show increased resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. they are considered as the factors responsible for the cases of tumor relapse. the cscs may have significant role in the development of lung tumorigenesis based on the identification of the cscs which respond during injury. the properties of multi-potency and self-renewal are shared in common by the lung cscs with the normal pluripotent stem cells which can",lung stem cell implication future therapeutic lung dreaded high mortality rate associate worldwide various subtypes lung respond differently particular regime make therapeutic intervention complicate concept stem cell cscs base primarily experimental observation indicate existence subpopulation cell capacity self renew differentiate well show increase resistance radiation chemotherapy consider factor responsible relapse cscs may significant role development lung tumorigenesis base identification cscs respond injury property multi potency self renewal share common lung cscs normal pluripotent stem cell,c,Lung Cancer

"Quality of life during clinical trials: conceptual model for the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) To appreciate the full benefits of treatment for lung cancer, especially in trials that fail to show improvements in survival, data recording the quality of life must be captured and refined to produce meaningful information. A conceptual model for quality of life for lung cancer patients was tested to obtain information about the dimensions of the quality-of-life construct for ongoing development and testing of a subjective measure for clinical trials. Using a longitudinal study design, the stability of predictive factors of the physical and functional dimensions of quality of life were examined using regression analysis. A patient-rated quality-of-life measure, the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), was administered to 144 non-smallcell lung cancer patients at baseline, day 29, and day 71 of a chemotherapy trial. The range of explained variance for all three components of the lung cancer model over three assessment points was as follows: symptomatic distress 41%–53%, activity status 48%–52%, and overall quality of life 35%–53%. The three dimensions fluctuated slightly during intervention, but were relatively stable factors across all three times of evaluation. The LCSS model explained nearly half of the variance for quality of life experienced by lung cancer patients during therapy with a new chemotherapeutic agent. These findings provide support that the physical and functional dimensions are important predictors of quality of life for individuals with lung cancer. Meaningful subjective quality-of-life data can be obtained to evaluate an intervention by using a disease-and sitespecific quality-of-life measure for individuals with lung cancer, based on a reproducible conceptual model such as the LCSS, which is suitable for serial measurement for the progressive disease of lung cancer.","quality of life during clinical trials: conceptual model for the lung cancer symptom scale (lcss) to appreciate the full benefits of treatment for lung cancer, especially in trials that fail to show improvements in survival, data recording the quality of life must be captured and refined to produce meaningful information. a conceptual model for quality of life for lung cancer patients was tested to obtain information about the dimensions of the quality-of-life construct for ongoing development and testing of a subjective measure for clinical trials. using a longitudinal study design, the stability of predictive factors of the physical and functional dimensions of quality of life were examined using regression analysis. a patient-rated quality-of-life measure, the lung cancer symptom scale (lcss), was administered to 144 non-smallcell lung cancer patients at baseline, day 29, and day 71 of a chemotherapy trial. the range of explained variance for all three components of the",quality life trial conceptual model lung symptom scale lcss appreciate full benefit lung especially trial fail show improvement survival data record quality life must capture refine produce meaningful information conceptual model quality life lung test obtain information dimension quality life construct ongoing development testing subjective measure trial use longitudinal design stability predictive factor physical functional dimension quality life examine use regression rat quality life measure lung symptom scale lcss administer non smallcell lung baseline day day chemotherapy trial range explained variance three component,c,Lung Cancer

"Erratum to: Estimation of minimally important differences in EQ-5D utility and VAS scores in cancer Background: Understanding what constitutes an important difference on a HRQL measure is critical to its interpretation. The aim of this study was to provide a range of estimates of minimally important differences (MIDs) in EQ-5D scores in cancer and to determine if estimates are comparable in lung cancer. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data collected from 534 cancer patients, 50 of whom were lung cancer patients. A range of minimally important differences (MIDs) in EQ-5D index-based utility (UK and US) scores and VAS scores were estimated using both anchor-based and distribution-based (1/2 standard deviation and standard error of the measure) approaches. Groups were anchored using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) ratings and FACT-G total score-based quintiles. Results: For UK-utility scores, MID estimates based on PS ranged from 0.10 to 0.12 both for all cancers and for lung cancer subgroup.

"Visual assessment of early emphysema and interstitial abnormalities on CT is useful in lung cancer risk analysis Screening for lung cancer should be limited to a high-risk-population, and abnormalities in low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening images may be relevant for predicting the risk of lung cancer. Our aims were to compare the occurrence of visually detected emphysema and interstitial abnormalities in subjects with and without lung cancer in a screening population of smokers. Low-dose chest CT examinations (baseline and latest possible) of 1990 participants from The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial were independently evaluated by two observers who scored emphysema and interstitial abnormalities. Emphysema (lung density) was also measured quantitatively. Emphysema was seen more frequently and its extent was greater among participants with lung cancer on baseline (odds ratio (OR), 1.8, p = 0.017 and p = 0.002) and late examinations (OR 2.6, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). No significant difference was found using quantitative measurements. Interstitial abnormalities were more common findings among participants with lung cancer (OR 5.1, p < 0.001 and OR 4.5, p < 0.001).There was no association between presence of emphysema and presence of interstitial abnormalities (OR 0.75, p = 0.499). Even early signs of emphysema and interstitial abnormalities are associated with lung cancer.

"Association of serum follistatin levels with histological types and progression of tumor in human lung cancer Follistatin (FST), an activin-binding protein, inhibits activin action by interfering with activin binding to its receptor. The prognostic value of FST has been studied in various cancers. However, these studies rarely focus on lung cancer. In our study, we investigated the relationship between serum FST levels and lung cancer with histologic types, TNM staging, and recurrence. A total of 150 serum samples were collected, including 91 from patients with SCLC or NSCLC, 22 from patients with benign lung diseases, and 37 from healthy subjects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum FST levels in healthy subjects, patients with benign lung diseases and patients with lung cancers. Serum FST levels in patients with LADC, SCC, LASC, LCLC, and SCLC were much higher than those in healthy subjects and in patients with lung benign disease. A ROC curve was constructed for differentiating the lung cancer from the healthy subjects and benign lung diseases. The results indicated that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.971 and 0.728 respectively. According to TNM staging, serum FST level increased significantly in patients with stage III and IV of LADC. Moreover, serum FST expression were increased in LADC patients with different TNM category. Furthermore, we found that a higher expression of serum FST was correlated with recurrence in LADC patients. The serum FST levels gradually increased with the rise of TNM staging and category in lung cancer patients. These data suggest that serum FST levels not only can be used in auxiliary diagnosis for lung cancer but also might be associated with the disease progression and metastasis of lung cancers.","association of serum follistatin levels with histological types and progression of tumor in human lung cancer follistatin (fst), an activin-binding protein, inhibits activin action by interfering with activin binding to its receptor. the prognostic value of fst has been studied in various cancers. however, these studies rarely focus on lung cancer. in our study, we investigated the relationship between serum fst levels and lung cancer with histologic types, tnm staging, and recurrence. a total of 150 serum samples were collected, including 91 from patients with sclc or nsclc, 22 from patients with benign lung diseases, and 37 from healthy subjects. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum fst levels in healthy subjects, patients with benign lung diseases and patients with lung cancers. serum fst levels in patients with ladc, scc, lasc, lclc, and sclc were much higher than those in healthy subjects and in patients with lung benign disease.",association serum follistatin level histological type progression human lung follistatin fst activin bind protein inhibits activin action interfere activin binding receptor prognostic value fst various however rarely focus lung investigate relationship serum fst level lung histologic type tnm staging recurrence total serum sample collect include sclc nsclc benign lung healthy subject enzyme link immunosorbent assay use determine serum fst level healthy subject benign lung lung serum fst level ladc scc lasc lclc sclc much high healthy subject lung benign,c,Lung Cancer
"The preventive role of cardiorespiratory fitness in current male smokers who meet the American Cancer Society criteria for lung cancer screening: a prospective pilot study Survival benefits could be potentially improved by adding cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) to lung cancer screening. The current pilot study aimed to assess the association between CRF and adverse outcomes in current male smokers who are meeting the American Cancer Society (ACS) criteria for lung cancer screening. A total of 260 men with a baseline CRF assessment (treadmill exercise test) who are met the ACS lung cancer screening criteria (“current smokers aged 55–74 years with ≥ 30 pack/years smoking history”) were prospectively studied. Cox proportional hazard models were analyzed for all-cause and cancer mortality, total and lung cancer incidence. Mean age was 63.3 ± 5.4 years, smoking history 50.4 ± 26.7 pack/years, and CRF was 7.8 ± 3.2 metabolic equivalents (METs). During a mean of 10.2 ± 6.1 years follow-up, 80 participants developed any type of cancer, 19 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 66 died (cancer, n = 39, other causes, n = 27). In multivariable models, only CRF was associated with all-cause and cancer mortality. Each 1-MET higher CRF was associated with a 10% reduced risk for all-cause mortality [0.9, 95% CI (0.83 to 0.98), p = 0.017] and cancer mortality [0.9, 95% CI (0.8 to 0.99), p = 0.048]. CRF was not associated with total cancer incidence (p = 0.59) or lung cancer incidence (p = 0.96). Higher CRF is independently associated with lower risk of all-cause and cancer mortality in current male smokers who meet the ACS criteria for lung cancer screening. Screening for CRF and achieving higher CRF levels could potentially reduce mortality and serve as complementary preventive strategy in heavy smokers.","the preventive role of cardiorespiratory fitness in current male smokers who meet the american cancer society criteria for lung cancer screening: a prospective pilot study survival benefits could be potentially improved by adding cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) to lung cancer screening. the current pilot study aimed to assess the association between crf and adverse outcomes in current male smokers who are meeting the american cancer society (acs) criteria for lung cancer screening. a total of 260 men with a baseline crf assessment (treadmill exercise test) who are met the acs lung cancer screening criteria (“current smokers aged 55–74 years with ≥ 30 pack/years smoking history”) were prospectively studied. cox proportional hazard models were analyzed for all-cause and cancer mortality, total and lung cancer incidence. mean age was 63.3 ± 5.4 years, smoking history 50.4 ± 26.7 pack/years, and crf was 7.8 ± 3.2 metabolic equivalents (mets). during a mean of 10.2",preventive role cardiorespiratory fitness current male smoker meet american society criterion lung screen prospective pilot survival benefit could potentially improve add cardiorespiratory fitness crf lung screen current pilot assess association crf adverse outcome current male smoker meet american society acs criterion lung screen total men baseline crf assessment treadmill exercise test meet ac lung screen criterion current smoker age year pack year smoke history prospectively cox proportional hazard model analyze cause mortality total lung incidence mean age year smoke history pack year crf metabolic equivalent mets mean,c,Lung Cancer
"Isothiocyanates induce oxidative stress and suppress the metastasis potential of human non-small cell lung cancer cells Isothiocyanates are natural compounds found in consumable cruciferous vegetables. They have been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis by a wide variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models. Recent studies have also shown that isothiocyanates have antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of several types of cultured human cancer cells. Our previous study showed that PEITC inhibited human leukemia cells growth by inducing apoptosis. However, the effect of isothiocyanates on lung cancer cell metastasis has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of BITC and PEITC on metastatic potential of highly metastatic human lung cancer L9981 cells. Cell migration and invasion were measured by wound healing assay and transwell chemotaxis assay. Expression of metastasis-related genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The mechanisms of action were evaluated by flow cytometry, reporter assay and Western blotting. Our data showed that both BITC and PEITC inhibited L9981 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 values were 5.0 and 9.7 μM, respectively. Cell migrations were reduced to 8.1% and 16.5% of control, respectively; and cell invasions were reduced to 2.7% and 7.3% of control, respectively. Metastasis-related genes MMP-2, Twist and β-catenin were also modulated. BITC and PEITC inhibited cell survival signaling molecules Akt and NFκB activation. Moreover, BITC and PEITC increased ROS generation and caused GSH depletion. Pretreatment with NAC blocked BITC and PEITC induced ROS elevation and NFκB inhibition. Our results indicated that BITC and PEITC suppress lung cancer cell metastasis potential by modulation of metastasis-related gene expression, inhibition of Akt/NFκB pathway.

"Signaling pathways and clinical application of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer An increasing number of studies have focused on the early diagnostic value of the methylation of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. However, the intricate cellular events related to RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer are still a mystery. For researchers and clinicians aiming to more profoundly understand the diagnostic value of methylated RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, this review will provide deeper insights into the molecular events of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. We searched for relevant publications in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using the keywords “RASSF1A”, “SHOX2” and “lung cancer” etc. First, we reviewed the RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes, from their family structures to the functions of their basic structural domains. Then we mainly focused on the roles of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, especially on their molecular events in recent decades. Finally, we compared the value of measuring RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation with that of the common methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer patients. The RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes were confirmed to be regulators or effectors of multiple cancer signaling pathways, driving tumorigenesis and lung cancer progression. The detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation has higher sensitivity and specificity than other commonly used methods for diagnosing lung cancer, especially in the early stage. The RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes are critical for the processes of tumorigenesis, development, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence in lung cancer. The combined detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation was identified as an excellent method for the screening and surveillance of lung cancer that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity.","signaling pathways and clinical application of rassf1a and shox2 in lung cancer an increasing number of studies have focused on the early diagnostic value of the methylation of rassf1a and shox2 in lung cancer. however, the intricate cellular events related to rassf1a and shox2 in lung cancer are still a mystery. for researchers and clinicians aiming to more profoundly understand the diagnostic value of methylated rassf1a and shox2 in lung cancer, this review will provide deeper insights into the molecular events of rassf1a and shox2 in lung cancer. we searched for relevant publications in the pubmed and google scholar databases using the keywords “rassf1a”, “shox2” and “lung cancer” etc. first, we reviewed the rassf1a and shox2 genes, from their family structures to the functions of their basic structural domains. then we mainly focused on the roles of rassf1a and shox2 in lung cancer, especially on their molecular events in recent",signal pathway application rassf shox lung increase number focus early diagnostic value methylation rassf shox lung however intricate cellular event relate rassf shox lung still mystery researcher clinician profoundly understand diagnostic value methylated rassf shox lung review provide deep insight molecular event rassf shox lung search relevant publication google scholar database use keywords rassf shox lung etc first review rassf shox gene family structure function basic structural domain mainly focus role rassf shox lung especially molecular event recent,c,Lung Cancer
"Serum and blood based biomarkers for lung cancer screening: a systematic review. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) is recommended for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations and may decrease lung cancer mortality, there is a need to improve the accuracy of lung cancer screening to decrease over-diagnosis and morbidity. Blood and serum-based biomarkers, including EarlyCDT-lung and microRNA based biomarkers, are promising adjuncts to LDCT in lung cancer screening. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of EarlyCDT-lung, micro-RNA signature classifier (MSC), and miR-test, and their impact on lung cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality. References were identified using searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid Medline® from January 2000 to November 2015. Phase three or greater studies in the English language evaluating the diagnostic performance of EarlyCDT-lung, MSC, and miR-test were selected for inclusion. Three phase 3 studies were identified, one evaluating EarlyCDT-lung, one evaluating miR-Test, and one evaluating MSC respectively. No phase 4 or 5 studies were identified. All three biomarker assays show promise for the detection of lung cancer. MSC shows promise when used in conjunction with LDCT for lung cancer detection, achieving a positive likelihood ratio of 18.6 if both LDCT and MSC are positive, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.03 if both LDCT and MSC are negative. However, there is a paucity of high-quality studies that can guide clinical implementation. There is currently no high quality evidence to support or guide the implementation of these biomarkers in clinical practice. Reports of further research at stages four and five for these, and other promising methods, is required.","serum and blood based biomarkers for lung cancer screening: a systematic review. lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. although low-dose ct (ldct) is recommended for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations and may decrease lung cancer mortality, there is a need to improve the accuracy of lung cancer screening to decrease over-diagnosis and morbidity. blood and serum-based biomarkers, including earlycdt-lung and microrna based biomarkers, are promising adjuncts to ldct in lung cancer screening. we evaluated the diagnostic performance of earlycdt-lung, micro-rna signature classifier (msc), and mir-test, and their impact on lung cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality. references were identified using searches of pubmed, embase, and ovid medline® from january 2000 to november 2015. phase three or greater studies in the english language evaluating the diagnostic performance of earlycdt-lung, msc, and mir-test were selected for inclusion. three",serum blood base biomarkers lung screen systematic review lung second common lead cause death men woman although low dose ct ldct recommend lung screen high risk population may decrease lung mortality need improve accuracy lung screen decrease diagnosis morbidity blood serum base biomarkers include earlycdt lung microrna base biomarkers promise adjunct ldct lung screen evaluate diagnostic performance earlycdt lung micro rna signature classifier msc mir test impact lung relate mortality cause mortality reference identify use search embase ovid medline january november phase three great english language evaluate diagnostic performance earlycdt lung msc mir test select inclusion three,c,Lung Cancer
"Metabolic shifts in lipid utilization and reciprocal interactions within the lung metastatic niche of triple-negative breast cancer revealed by spatial multi-omics. The Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype constitutes 15-20% of breast cancer cases and is associated with the poorest clinical outcomes. Distant metastasis, particularly to the lungs, is a major contributor to the high mortality rates in breast cancer patients. Despite this, there has been a lack of comprehensive insights into the heterogeneity of metastatic tumors and their surrounding ecosystem in the lungs. In this study, we utilized spatial RNA sequencing technology to investigate the heterogeneity of lung metastatic tumors and their microenvironment in two spontaneous lung metastatic mouse models. Our findings revealed an increase in metabolic-related genes within the cancer cells, with the hub gene Dlat (Dihydrolipoamide S-Acetyltransferase) showing a significant association with the development of lung metastatic tumors. Upregulation of Dlat led to the reprogramming of fatty acid utilization, markedly enhancing the bioenergetic capacity of cancer cells. This finding was corroborated by the increased dependence on fatty acid utilization in lung metastatic cancer cells, and inhibition of Dlat in breast cancer cells exhibited a reduced oxygen consumption rate. Consequently, inhibition of Dlat resulted in decreased survival capacity of breast cancer by reducing cancer stem cell properties and cell adhesion in the lung in vivo. The three cell components within the lung metastatic niche, including CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells, expressed elevated levels of ApoE, leading to the secretion of various protumorigenic molecules that promote cancer cell growth in the lung. These molecules include galectin-1, S100A10, S100A4, and S100A6.

"Multi-window CT based Radiomic signatures in differentiating indolent versus aggressive lung cancers in the National Lung Screening Trial: a retrospective study We retrospectively evaluated the capability of radiomic features to predict tumor growth in lung cancer screening and compared the performance of multi-window radiomic features and single window radiomic features. One hundred fifty lung nodules among 114 screen-detected, incident lung cancer patients from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were investigated. Volume double time (VDT) was calculated as the difference between continuous two scans and used to define indolent and aggressive lung cancers. Lung nodules were semi-automatically segmented using lung and mediastinal windows separately, and subtracting the mediastinal window region from the lung window region generated the difference region. 364 radiomic features were separately exacted from nodules using the lung window, the mediastinal window and the difference region. Multivariable models were conducted to identify the most predictive features in predicting tumor growth. Clinical information was also obtained from the database. Based on our definition, 26% of the cases were indolent lung cancer. The tumor growth pattern could be predicted by radiomic models constructed using features obtained in the lung window, the difference region, and by combining features obtained in both the lung window and difference regions with areas under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROCs) of 0.799, 0.819, and 0.846, respectively. The multi-window feature model showed better performance compared to single window features (P < 0.001). Incorporating clinical factors into the multi-window feature models showed improvement, yielding an accuracy of 84.67% and AUROC of 0.855 for distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease.

"miRNAs as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Current Perspectives Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Up to 85% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effectiveness of NSCLC treatment is expected to be improved through the implementation of robust and specific biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding molecules that play a key role in the regulation of basic cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, by controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Deregulation of miRNA activity results in the loss of homeostasis and the development of a number of pathologies, including lung cancer. During lung carcinogenesis, miRNAs exhibit dual regulatory function: they act as oncogenes to promote cancer development or as tumour suppressors. Unique miRNA sequences have been detected in malignant tissues and corresponding healthy tissues. Furthermore, stable forms of tumour-related miRNAs are detectable in the peripheral blood of patients with NSCLC. The potential benefits of using extracellular miRNAs present in body fluids as part of the diagnostic evaluation of cancer include low invasiveness (compared with tumour cell/tissue sampling), and the repeatability and ease of obtaining the specimens. Apart from the diagnostic applications of altered miRNA expression profiles, the dual regulatory role of miRNA in cancer might drive the further development of personalised therapies in NSCLC. The clinical usefulness of miRNA expression analysis to predict the efficacy of various treatment strategies including surgery, radio- and chemotherapy, and targeted therapies has been evaluated in NSCLC. Also, the capacity of a single miRNA to regulate the expression of multiple genes simultaneously presents an opportunity to use these small molecules in personalised therapy as individualised therapeutic tools.","mirnas as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer: current perspectives lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. up to 85% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). the effectiveness of nsclc treatment is expected to be improved through the implementation of robust and specific biomarkers. micrornas (mirnas) are small, non-coding molecules that play a key role in the regulation of basic cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, by controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. deregulation of mirna activity results in the loss of homeostasis and the development of a number of pathologies, including lung cancer. during lung carcinogenesis, mirnas exhibit dual regulatory function: they act as oncogenes to promote cancer development or as tumour suppressors. unique mirna sequences have been detected in malignant tissues and corresponding healthy tissues. furthermore, stable forms of tumour-related mirnas are detectable in the peripheral",mirnas biomarkers therapeutic target non small cell lung current perspective lung common worldwide lung diagnose non small cell lung nsclc effectiveness nsclc expect improve implementation robust specific biomarkers micrornas mirnas small non cod molecule play key role regulation basic cellular process include differentiation proliferation apoptosis control gene expression post transcriptional level deregulation mirna activity result loss homeostasis development number pathology include lung lung carcinogenesis mirnas exhibit dual regulatory function act oncogene promote development suppressor unique mirna sequence detect malignant tissue correspond healthy tissue furthermore stable form relate mirnas detectable peripheral,c,Lung Cancer
"Body composition and lung cancer-associated cachexia in TRACERx. Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer. Key features of CAC include alterations in body composition and body weight. Here, we explore the association between body composition and body weight with survival and delineate potential biological processes and mediators that contribute to the development of CAC. Computed tomography-based body composition analysis of 651 individuals in the TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study suggested that individuals in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution of skeletal muscle or adipose tissue area at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, had significantly shorter lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival. This finding was validated in 420 individuals in the independent Boston Lung Cancer Study. Individuals classified as having developed CAC according to one or more features at relapse encompassing loss of adipose or muscle tissue, or body mass index-adjusted weight loss were found to have distinct tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles compared with individuals who did not develop such features. Primary non-small cell lung cancers from individuals who developed CAC were characterized by enrichment of inflammatory signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transitional pathways, and differentially expressed genes upregulated in these tumors included cancer-testis antigen MAGEA6 and matrix metalloproteinases, such as ADAMTS3. In an exploratory proteomic analysis of circulating putative mediators of cachexia performed in a subset of 110 individuals from TRACERx, a significant association between circulating GDF15 and loss of body weight, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was identified at relapse, supporting the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting GDF15 in the management of CAC.","body composition and lung cancer-associated cachexia in tracerx. cancer-associated cachexia (cac) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer. key features of cac include alterations in body composition and body weight. here, we explore the association between body composition and body weight with survival and delineate potential biological processes and mediators that contribute to the development of cac. computed tomography-based body composition analysis of 651 individuals in the tracerx (tracking non-small cell lung cancer evolution through therapy (rx)) study suggested that individuals in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution of skeletal muscle or adipose tissue area at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, had significantly shorter lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival. this finding was validated in 420 individuals in the independent boston lung cancer study. individuals classified as having developed cac according to one or more features at relapse encompassing loss",body composition lung associate cachexia tracerx associate cachexia cac major contributor morbidity mortality individual non small cell lung key feature cac include alteration body composition body weight explore association body composition body weight survival delineate potential biological process mediator contribute development cac compute tomography base body composition individual tracerx track non small cell lung evolution therapy rx suggest individual bottom th percentile distribution skeletal muscle adipose tissue area time lung diagnosis significantly short lung specific survival overall survival finding validate individual independent boston lung individual classify develop cac accord one feature relapse encompass loss,c,Lung Cancer
"Lung cancer referral patterns in the former Yorkshire region of the UK The purpose of this study was to find out what proportion of patients are referred as lung cancer guidelines assume, whether different referral pathways result in different management and what proportion of patients are seen within recommended time intervals between referral and treatment. A randomly selected sample of 400 lung cancer cases registered with the former Yorkshire Cancer Registry database in 1993 was selected for casenote analysis. Mode of presentation, speciality of initial referral, treatment by specialist, time intervals for key points in the referral pathways were analyzed. A total of 362 (90.5%) of case-notes were available. Less than half of lung cancer patients (173, 47.8%) presented to hospital with a chest X-ray diagnosis of lung cancer. Forty-one (11.3%) presented as self-referrals to Accident and Emergency and the remainder were referred without a diagnosis of lung cancer by other routes, mainly via GPs. Patients who did not present initially with a lung cancer diagnosis were less likely to receive specialist care (62%:96%), or have their diagnosis histologically confirmed (57.1%:80.3%) or receive surgery or radical radiotherapy (6.9%:13.9%).

"Index-based dietary patterns and risk of lung cancer in the NIH-AARP diet and health study. Dietary pattern analysis considers combinations of food intake and may offer a better measure to assess diet–cancer associations than examining individual foods or nutrients. Although tobacco exposure is the major risk factor for lung cancer, few studies have examined whether dietary patterns, based on preexisting dietary guidelines, influence lung cancer risk. After controlling for smoking, we examined associations between four diet quality indices—Healthy Eating Index–2010 (HEI-2010), Alternate Healthy Eating Index–2010 (AHEI-2010), alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)—and lung cancer risk in the NIH–AARP (National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health study. Baseline dietary intake was assessed in 460 770 participants. Over a median of 10.5 years of follow-up, 9272 incident lung cancer cases occurred. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Comparing highest to lowest quintiles, HRs (95% CIs) for lung cancer were as follows: HEI-2010=0.83 (0.77–0.89), AHEI-2010=0.86 (0.80–0.92), aMED=0.85 (0.79–0.91) and DASH=0.84 (0.78–0.90). Among the individual components of the dietary indices, higher consumption of whole grains and fruits was significantly inversely associated with lung cancer risk for several of the diet indices. Total index score analyses stratified by smoking status showed inverse associations with lung cancer for former smokers; however, only HEI-2010 was inversely associated in current smokers and no index score was inversely associated among never smokers. Although smoking is the factor most strongly associated with lung cancer, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that diet may have a modest role in reducing lung cancer risk, especially among former smokers.","index-based dietary patterns and risk of lung cancer in the nih-aarp diet and health study. dietary pattern analysis considers combinations of food intake and may offer a better measure to assess diet–cancer associations than examining individual foods or nutrients. although tobacco exposure is the major risk factor for lung cancer, few studies have examined whether dietary patterns, based on preexisting dietary guidelines, influence lung cancer risk. after controlling for smoking, we examined associations between four diet quality indices—healthy eating index–2010 (hei-2010), alternate healthy eating index–2010 (ahei-2010), alternate mediterranean diet score (amed) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (dash)—and lung cancer risk in the nih–aarp (national institutes of health-american association of retired persons) diet and health study. baseline dietary intake was assessed in 460 770 participants. over a median of 10.5 years of follow-up, 9272 incident lung cancer cases occurred. cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs)",index base dietary pattern risk lung nih aarp diet health dietary pattern considers combination food intake may offer good measure assess diet association examine individual food nutrient although tobacco exposure major risk factor lung examine whether dietary pattern base preexist dietary guideline influence lung risk control smoke examine association four diet quality index healthy eat index hei alternate healthy eat index ahei alternate mediterranean diet score amed dietary approach stop hypertension dash lung risk nih aarp national institute health american association retired person diet health baseline dietary intake assess participant median year follow incident lung occur cox proportional hazard regression use estimate hazard ratio hrs,c,Lung Cancer
"Potential Racial Disparities Using Current Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines. The current age threshold for lung cancer screening targets individuals beginning at age 55. These guidelines were developed based on results from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial where only 4.4% of the enrollees were African American, when they represent 12.3% of US population. African Americans were also found to have higher incidence and younger onset of lung cancer. We hypothesized that implementation of screening at age 55 would not detect a substantial fraction of early onset lung cancer cases in African American population. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data to determine the frequency of early-onset lung cancers and to assess the stage at diagnosis in a biracial sample. Microscopically confirmed lung cancer (primary site code C 34) cases were identified using SEER 18 registry (2004–2014). Early-onset cancers were defined as cancers diagnosed in persons aged 45 to 54 years. Cases were stratified by race and age groups. Comparisons were evaluated with chi-square tests. 468,403 lung cancers were diagnosed during this period. Nearly 9% of all lung cancers were early onset, with increased frequency in African Americans vs. Whites, 14.2 vs. 8.2%, p < 0.05. Age-adjusted incidence rates were significantly higher in African Americans with highest percent difference noted for age group 50–54. African Americans were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages of lung cancer compared to Whites. We conclude that the current age threshold for lung cancer screening may potentially miss a considerable number of lung cancer cases in African Americans. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriateness of screening age criteria for African Americans.","potential racial disparities using current lung cancer screening guidelines. the current age threshold for lung cancer screening targets individuals beginning at age 55. these guidelines were developed based on results from the national lung cancer screening trial where only 4.4% of the enrollees were african american, when they represent 12.3% of us population. african americans were also found to have higher incidence and younger onset of lung cancer. we hypothesized that implementation of screening at age 55 would not detect a substantial fraction of early onset lung cancer cases in african american population. we used surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program data to determine the frequency of early-onset lung cancers and to assess the stage at diagnosis in a biracial sample. microscopically confirmed lung cancer (primary site code c 34) cases were identified using seer 18 registry (2004–2014). early-onset cancers were defined as cancers diagnosed in persons aged 45",potential racial disparity use current lung screen guideline current age threshold lung screen target individual begin age guideline develop base result national lung screen trial enrollee african american represent u population african american also find high incidence young onset lung hypothesize implementation screen age would detect substantial fraction early onset lung african american population use surveillance epidemiology end result seer program data determine frequency early onset lung assess stage diagnosis biracial sample microscopically confirm lung primary site code c identify use seer registry early onset define diagnose person age,c,Lung Cancer
"KLF4 regulates adult lung tumor-initiating cells and represses K-Ras-mediated lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women worldwide. To identify novel factors that contribute to lung cancer pathogenesis, we analyzed a lung cancer database from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) expression is significantly lower in patients' lung cancer tissue than in normal lung tissue. In addition, we identified seven missense mutations in the KLF4 gene. KLF4 is a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the self-renewal of stem cells. To understand the role of KLF4 in the lung, we generated a tamoxifen-induced Klf4 knockout mouse model. We found that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell growth and that depletion of Klf4 altered the differentiation pattern in the developing lung. To understand how KLF4 functions during lung tumorigenesis, we generated the K-ras(LSL-G12D/+);Klf4(fl/fl) mouse model, and we used adenovirus-expressed Cre to induce K-ras activation and Klf4 depletion in the lung. Although Klf4 deletion alone or K-ras mutation alone can trigger lung tumor formation, Klf4 deletion combined with K-ras mutation significantly enhanced lung tumor formation. We also found that Klf4 deletion in conjunction with K-ras activation caused lung inflammation. To understand the mechanism whereby KLF4 is regulated during lung tumorigenesis, we analyzed KLF4 promoter methylation and the profiles of epigenetic factors. We found that Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in lung cancer and that HDAC inhibitors induced expression of KLF4 and inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells, suggesting that KLF4 is probably repressed by histone acetylation and that HDACs are valuable drug targets for lung cancer treatment.","klf4 regulates adult lung tumor-initiating cells and represses k-ras-mediated lung cancer lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women worldwide. to identify novel factors that contribute to lung cancer pathogenesis, we analyzed a lung cancer database from the cancer genome atlas and found that kruppel-like factor 4 (klf4) expression is significantly lower in patients' lung cancer tissue than in normal lung tissue. in addition, we identified seven missense mutations in the klf4 gene. klf4 is a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the self-renewal of stem cells. to understand the role of klf4 in the lung, we generated a tamoxifen-induced klf4 knockout mouse model. we found that klf4 inhibits lung cancer cell growth and that depletion of klf4 altered the differentiation pattern in the developing lung. to understand how klf4 functions during lung tumorigenesis, we generated the k-ras(lsl-g12d/+);klf4(fl/fl) mouse",klf regulate adult lung initiate cell represses k ra mediate lung lung lead cause relate mortality men woman worldwide identify novel factor contribute lung pathogenesis analyze lung database genome atlas find kruppel like factor klf expression significantly low lung tissue normal lung tissue addition identify seven missense mutation klf gene klf transcription factor regulate cell proliferation differentiation well self renewal stem cell understand role klf lung generate tamoxifen induce klf knockout mouse model find klf inhibits lung cell growth depletion klf alter differentiation pattern developing lung understand klf function lung tumorigenesis generate k ras lsl g klf fl fl mouse,c,Lung Cancer
"Preoperative AminoIndex Cancer Screening (AICS) abnormalities predict postoperative recurrence in patients undergoing curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer AminoIndex™ Cancer Screening (AICS (lung)) was developed as a screening test for lung cancer using a multivariate analysis of plasma-free amino acid (PFAA) profiles. According to the developed index composed of PFAA, the probability of lung cancer was categorized into AICS (lung) ranks A, B, and C in order of increasing risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the preoperative AICS (lung) rank and surgical outcomes in patients who underwent curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preoperative blood samples were collected from 297 patients who underwent curative resection for NSCLC between 2006 and 2015. PFAA concentrations were measured. The relationship between the preoperative AICS (lung) rank and clinicopathological factors was examined. The effects of the preoperative AICS (lung) rank on postoperative outcomes were also analyzed. The AICS (lung) rank was A in 93 patients (31.3%), B in 82 (27.6%), and C in 122 (41.1%). The AICS (lung) rank did not correlate with any clinicopathological factors, except for age. Based on follow-up data (median follow-up period of 6 years), postoperative recurrence was observed in 22 rank A patients (23.7%), 15 rank B (18.3%) and 49 rank C (40.2%). In the univariate analysis, preoperative AICS (lung) rank C was a worse factor of recurrence-free survival (p = 0.0002). The multivariate analysis identified preoperative AICS (lung) rank C (HR: 2.17, p = 0.0005) as a significant predictor of postoperative recurrence, particularly in patients with early-stage disease or adenocarcinoma. Preoperative AICS (lung) rank C is a high-risk predictor of postoperative recurrence in patients undergoing curative resection for NSCLC.","preoperative aminoindex cancer screening (aics) abnormalities predict postoperative recurrence in patients undergoing curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer aminoindex™ cancer screening (aics (lung)) was developed as a screening test for lung cancer using a multivariate analysis of plasma-free amino acid (pfaa) profiles. according to the developed index composed of pfaa, the probability of lung cancer was categorized into aics (lung) ranks a, b, and c in order of increasing risk. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the preoperative aics (lung) rank and surgical outcomes in patients who underwent curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). preoperative blood samples were collected from 297 patients who underwent curative resection for nsclc between 2006 and 2015. pfaa concentrations were measured. the relationship between the preoperative aics (lung) rank and clinicopathological factors was examined. the effects of the preoperative aics (lung) rank on postoperative outcomes were",preoperative aminoindex screen aics abnormality predict postoperative recurrence undergo curative resection non small cell lung aminoindex screen aics lung develop screening test lung use multivariate plasma free amino acid pfaa profile accord developed index compose pfaa probability lung categorize aics lung rank b c order increase risk present investigate relationship preoperative aics lung rank surgical outcome undergo curative resection non small cell lung nsclc preoperative blood sample collect undergo curative resection nsclc pfaa concentration measure relationship preoperative aics lung rank clinicopathological factor examine effect preoperative aics lung rank postoperative outcome,c,Lung Cancer

"Recent trends and future directions for lung cancer mortality in Europe Lung cancer mortality patterns throughout Europe are very heterogeneous and largely reflect past smoking habits. In order to clarify the changing patterns of lung cancer in Europe we have plotted the overall lung cancer trends among men and women for 20 countries from 1950 up to 1998. Furthermore, using a Bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated 5 year projections of lung cancer rate up to 2003. Finally, we make some comments on probable future trends by analysing recent trends in adults aged <55 years. Lung cancer mortality rates up to age 75 years portray a general trend of decreasing lung cancer rates among men and increasing lung cancer rates among women. Exceptions to this decrease among men include Hungary where not only are current mortality rates much higher than previously observed in any other country (at 76.7 out of 100,000 in 1998) but they are projected to increase further in the short term. Rates among adults aged <55 years have recently peaked, indicating that overall rates are likely to peak in the next decade. Among women, rapid increases have been observed in Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary, Ireland and UK. Whereas Ireland and UK rates have started to decrease and are projected to continue falling, rates in the other three countries are projected to increase further. Trends in women aged <55 years indicate that rates in Danish women will peak in the next decade, whereas lung cancer rates among Dutch women are likely to continue increasing. Rates in Hungarian women are likely to increase and will surpass the current high rate observed in Denmark.","recent trends and future directions for lung cancer mortality in europe lung cancer mortality patterns throughout europe are very heterogeneous and largely reflect past smoking habits. in order to clarify the changing patterns of lung cancer in europe we have plotted the overall lung cancer trends among men and women for 20 countries from 1950 up to 1998. furthermore, using a bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated 5 year projections of lung cancer rate up to 2003. finally, we make some comments on probable future trends by analysing recent trends in adults aged <55 years. lung cancer mortality rates up to age 75 years portray a general trend of decreasing lung cancer rates among men and increasing lung cancer rates among women. exceptions to this decrease among men include hungary where not only are current mortality rates much higher than previously observed in any other country (at 76.7 out of",recent trend future direction lung mortality europe lung mortality pattern throughout europe heterogeneous largely reflect past smoke habit order clarify change pattern lung europe plot overall lung trend among men woman country furthermore use bayesian age period cohort approach calculate year projection lung rate finally make comment probable future trend analyse recent trend adult age year lung mortality rate age year portray general trend decrease lung rate among men increase lung rate among woman exception decrease among men include hungary current mortality rate much high previously observe country,c,Lung Cancer
"Integration of clinical phenoms and metabolomics facilitates precision medicine for lung cancer. Lung cancer is a common malignancy that is frequently associated with systemic metabolic disorders. Early detection is pivotal to survival improvement. Although blood biomarkers have been used in its early diagnosis, missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis still exist due to the heterogeneity of lung cancer. Integration of multiple biomarkers or trans-omics results can improve the accuracy and reliability for lung cancer diagnosis. As metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of lung cancer, metabolites, specifically lipids might be useful for lung cancer detection, yet systematic characterizations of metabolites in lung cancer are still incipient. The present study profiled the polar metabolome and lipidome in the plasma of lung cancer patients to construct an inclusive metabolomic atlas of lung cancer. A comprehensive analysis of lung cancer was also conducted combining metabolomics with clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, the differences in plasma lipid metabolites were compared and analyzed among different lung cancer subtypes. Alcohols, amides, and peptide metabolites were significantly increased in lung cancer, while carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids were remarkably decreased. Lipid profiling revealed a significant increase in plasma levels of CER, PE, SM, and TAG in individuals with lung cancer as compared to those in healthy controls. Correlation analysis confirmed the association between a panel of metabolites and TAGs. Clinical trans-omics studies elucidated the complex correlations between lipidomic data and clinical phenotypes. The present study emphasized the clinical importance of lipidomics in lung cancer, which involves the correlation between metabolites and the expressions of other omics, ultimately influencing clinical phenotypes. This novel trans-omics network approach would facilitate the development of precision therapy for lung cancer.","integration of clinical phenoms and metabolomics facilitates precision medicine for lung cancer. lung cancer is a common malignancy that is frequently associated with systemic metabolic disorders. early detection is pivotal to survival improvement. although blood biomarkers have been used in its early diagnosis, missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis still exist due to the heterogeneity of lung cancer. integration of multiple biomarkers or trans-omics results can improve the accuracy and reliability for lung cancer diagnosis. as metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of lung cancer, metabolites, specifically lipids might be useful for lung cancer detection, yet systematic characterizations of metabolites in lung cancer are still incipient. the present study profiled the polar metabolome and lipidome in the plasma of lung cancer patients to construct an inclusive metabolomic atlas of lung cancer. a comprehensive analysis of lung cancer was also conducted combining metabolomics with clinical phenotypes. furthermore, the differences in plasma lipid metabolites were",integration phenoms metabolomics facilitates precision medicine lung lung common malignancy frequently associate systemic metabolic disorder early detection pivotal survival improvement although blood biomarkers use early diagnosis miss diagnosis misdiagnosis still exist due heterogeneity lung integration multiple biomarkers trans omics result improve accuracy reliability lung diagnosis metabolic reprogramming hallmark lung metabolites specifically lipids might useful lung detection yet systematic characterization metabolite lung still incipient present profile polar metabolome lipidome plasma lung construct inclusive metabolomic atlas lung comprehensive lung also conduct combine metabolomics phenotype furthermore difference plasma lipid metabolite,c,Lung Cancer

The specific group of intestinal and mixed histopathological subtype occurs more frequently (OR=1.671) in consecutive carriers of I157T mutation.; ; Recently, the NOD2/CARD15, gene located on chromosome 16q12, has been associated with Crohn’s disease. It is believed to play a role both in intracellular recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typical of Gram negative bacteria and subsequent activation of NFkB. 3020insC NOD2 mutation causes an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and colorectal cancer in their course. In light of recent studies, in fact 3020insC mutation predisposes to cancers of many organs, including breast, ovarian, lung. Studies conducted in our center in the group of 103 patients with a family history of gastric cancer, have shown that NOD2 3020insC carriers in persons over 50 y of age more than doubled (OR=2.479, p=0.022) and among women almost 3-fold increased risk. In addition, NOD2 R702W alteration occurred almost three times more frequently (OR=2.816, p=0.0121) in the group of 241 consecutive patients with gastric cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age and over 2-times frequently (OR=2.268, p=0.0371) in gastric cancer selected histopathologically as intestinal type according to Lauren.; ; There are a large number of reports describing the relationship between changes in the gene TP53, particularly polimomorfizm Arg72Pro, and risk of gastric cancer.

"Hereditary colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome The term Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, or HNPCC, has been less used for naming the classical autosomal dominantly inherited susceptibility to cancer [1]. As this susceptibility applies to tumors from different primary sites other than but including colorectal cancer (CRC), the term Lynch Syndrome (LS) is a less restrictive name. Lynch Syndrome is characterized by an autosomal dominantly inherited susceptibility to cancer, caused by inherited germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. It is characterized by early age of onset, predilection to the proximal colon, multiple primary CRCs, and extracolonic tumors, particularly endometrium carcinoma (EC) [2,3].; ; To establish a profile of the disease, a better definition of the spectrum of related tumors has been a constant concern [4,5]. It is therefore expected to find heterogeneity among the families regarding the susceptibility to develop tumors in different specific sites. The risk of cancer in fact varies among families with LS, although the variation does not necessarily result from genetic heterogeneity. The standards of environmental exposure must contribute to the differential gene expression, justifying at least in part this heterogeneity [6].; ; LS accounts for 2%–5% of all CRC cases [7]. In fact, it is believed that 20% to 30% of patients with CRC present some type of genetic susceptibility, but without meeting criteria for known typical syndromes. However, new cancer cases in the patient’s family or supplemental information on previously unknown cases can lead to a reclassification that may characterize a typical syndrome. In other situations, despite the lack of clinical criteria for determining an inherited character, molecular inquiry can define the diagnosis of inherited syndrome. For these reasons, even in the absence of typical clinical characterization, criteria must be used to direct the inquiry of an inherited condition.; ; The spectrum of extracolonic tumors in LS began to be the subject of several publications in which the most common cancers found were those affecting the endometrium, the stomach and the urinary tract [8-14]. Watson and Lynch [6] calculated the frequency of cancer in other specific sites in 1,300 high-risk individuals from 23 families having LS and demonstrated a significant increase of the risk of developing cancer in the stomach (RR:4.1), small bowel (RR:25), kidneys (RR:3.2), ureter (RR:22), and ovary (RR:3.5). The proposed extracolonic cancers associated with LS are endometrium, stomach, ovary, small bowel, ureter, renal pelvis, brain, and hepatobiliary tract. Among these tumors, endometrium, ureter, renal pelvis, and small bowel cancers present the highest relative risk, and are therefore the most specific for LS.; ; The Amsterdam criteria for clinical diagnosis of LS are: (1) at least three relatives must have histologically verified CRC, endometrium, ureter, renal pelvis, or small bowel cancer; (2) one must be a first-degree relative of the other two; (3) at least two successive generations must be affected; (4) at least one of the relatives with cancer must have received the diagnosis before age 50; and (5) familial adenomatous polyposis must have been excluded. Because there are families with an MMR mutation present exclusively in patients with endometrial cancer without CRC, the requirement of at least one case of CRC was suppressed [15,16].; ; Patients with LS may also have sebaceous adenomas, sebaceous carcinomas, and multiple keratoacanthomas, findings consonant with Torre’s syndrome variant [17,18]. The definition of LS includes a familial clustering of colorectal and/or endometrial cancer and as associated cancers stomach, ovary, ureter/renal pelvis, brain, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract, and skin (sebaceous tumors) tumors [15,19].; ; As discussed by Vasen [20], since it is known that LS is caused by an mismatch repair gene defect and that the hallmark of the syndrome is microsatellite instability (MSI), more attention should be given to the so-called Bethesda guidelines, which describe almost all clinical conditions in which there is suspicion of LS and in which a search for MSI is indicated, mainly early onset of colorectal adenomas and cancer.","hereditary colorectal cancer and lynch syndrome the term hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or hnpcc, has been less used for naming the classical autosomal dominantly inherited susceptibility to cancer [1]. as this susceptibility applies to tumors from different primary sites other than but including colorectal cancer (crc), the term lynch syndrome (ls) is a less restrictive name. lynch syndrome is characterized by an autosomal dominantly inherited susceptibility to cancer, caused by inherited germline mutations in the mismatch repair (mmr) genes. it is characterized by early age of onset, predilection to the proximal colon, multiple primary crcs, and extracolonic tumors, particularly endometrium carcinoma (ec) [2,3].; ; to establish a profile of the disease, a better definition of the spectrum of related tumors has been a constant concern [4,5]. it is therefore expected to find heterogeneity among the families regarding the susceptibility to develop tumors in different specific sites. the risk of cancer",hereditary colorectal lynch syndrome term hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal hnpcc less use name classical autosomal dominantly inherit susceptibility susceptibility apply different primary sit include colorectal crc term lynch syndrome l less restrictive name lynch syndrome characterize autosomal dominantly inherit susceptibility cause inherited germline mutation mismatch repair mmr gene characterize early age onset predilection proximal colon multiple primary crcs extracolonic particularly endometrium carcinoma ec establish profile good definition spectrum related constant concern therefore expect find heterogeneity among family regard susceptibility develop different specific sit risk,d,Stomach Cancer
"Appropriateness of splenectomy for advanced cancer located in the upper third of the stomach In cases of total gastrectomy for cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, the appropriateness of performing a splenectomy as a preventive dissection for spleen hilum lymph node (station number 10) has been broadly discussed in terms of both oncological principle and operational safety; however, no conclusions have yet been reached. Regarding our report [1], Hanisch and Ziogas [2] questioned whether or not it was appropriate, based on oncological principles, to select a surgical procedure of spleen preservation for advanced cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, in particular for cases of pathologically advanced serosa-positive (pT3) and nodepositive disease. Certainly, in terms of oncological concerns, it is correct to point out that not performing a spleen hilum lymph node dissection for pT3 cases involves the risk of increasing the possibility of postoperative recurrence. This is because a surgical spleen hilum lymph node dissection can be expected to be effective because the spleen is an organ adjacent to the stomach, connected to the stomach via short gastric arteries, and also having a close relationship with the stomach through lymphatic routes. In fact, in Japan, for cases of advanced stomach cancer with wall invasion of pT2 or higher (pT2, T3, T4), gastrectomy together with a D2 lymph node dissection has been recommended as a standard therapy [3, 4]. The purpose of our present study is to compare the surgical results of laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG), which preserves the spleen, and open total gastrectomy (OTG). Candidates for LATG comprised cases of clinical T1 (cT1) early-stage stomach cancer, while candidates for OTG comprised cases of advanced cancers with lower potential for spleen hilum lymph node metastasis. Specifically, we conducted a retrospective analysis of cases with lesions sized 5 cm or less in which there was no infiltration of the serosa and the spleen was preserved for those in which the lesion did not come into contact with the greater curvature. In such cases, we believed that the risk of postoperative recurrence through spleen hilum lymph node metastasis was low. On the other hand, in cases in which the lesion-occupied region is the greater curvature or in which the diameter of the tumor is large, spleen hilum lymph node metastasis is highly likely to occur and total gastrectomy with splenectomy is therefore more likely to be necessary. For the OTG group in our present study, cases of up to cT2 in the preoperative diagnosis were selected as candidates; however, pathologically, pT3 was present in 13/44 cases (29.5%), thus indicating the difficulty in obtaining preoperative diagnosis of wall invasion. We hope there will be more progress in diagnostic techniques of wall invasion in the future. In retrospective studies of cases of splenectomy for cancer located in the upper third of the stomach in Europe and the USA [5, 6], in many cases, the 5-year survival rate of splenectomy cases is lower by 10% or more compared with cases of spleen preservation. However, it is believed that this reflects the fact that the splenectomy group contains more cases with high levels of advancement, or that these results are due to the poor short-term surgical results of the splenectomy group, and therefore, these results do not accurately reflect the oncological appropriateness of a splenectomy (i.e., the effects of lymph node dissection). On the other hand, in studies conducted in Japan, there are few reports in which the 5-year survival rate is improved by S. Sakuramoto (&) K. Yamashita M.

"Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early Gastric Cancer: Constant Exertion for Clinical Application Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in gastric cancer. Standard surgery, therefore, is radical subtotal or total gastrectomy with wide dissection of regional lymph nodes. Recently, the proportion of early gastric cancer has increased to more than 60% in Korea and Japan because of screening gastroscopy. The rate of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer ranges from 5 to 20%, which means that more than 80% of patients with early gastric cancer undergo unnecessarily wide excision of the stomach with aggressive lymphadenectomy. If there is a tool to predict the exact status of lymph nodes, radical gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy can be substituted with limited resection of stomach without lymph node dissection. However, preoperative endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography have limited accuracy for nodal staging in gastric cancer patients. The sentinel node (SN) concept has been introduced into various solid tumors, including stomach cancer, to predict lymph node status. Ideally, if the SN has no metastasis, extensive lymphadenectomy can be avoided, the extent of resection of the stomach reduced, function preserved, complications lessened, recovery accelerated, and the quality of life for the patient improved. SN navigation surgery has been widely performed for the treatment of breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Regarding gastric cancer, it seemed that SN concept is difficult to apply because the lymphatic flow is multidirectional. However, many studies reported that SN mapping is feasible in gastric cancer especially in early gastric cancer even though many issues still remain to be solved. Sensitivity of SN biopsy is highly important in gastric cancer compared with breast cancer and malignant melanoma. When false-negative cases develop in patients with malignant melanoma or breast cancer, other treatment options, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy exist. Because gastric cancer has no other treatment option except surgery, a gastric cancer patient with false-negative SN loses an opportunity for cure. The detection rate is not as important as sensitivity in gastric cancer SN biopsy. Surgeons should perform just conventional lymphadenectomy for detection failure cases. Sensitivities of SN mapping in gastric cancer reported until now are not adequate for clinical application. Until now, the sensitivities were generally low and even the studies with high sensitivity had small number of cases with lymph node metastasis. There are several methods to increase the sensitivity of SN biopsy in gastric cancer. As pathologic methods, multiple sections of the SN may raise the rate of detecting lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with anti-cytokeratin antibody helps to detect micrometastases in SNs in addition to conventional hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin, or CD44, also is good tool for molecular detection of SN micrometastases. Rapid IHC or real-time RT-PCR is needed so that IHC or RT-PCR is applicable to SN biopsy for gastric cancer. Takeuchi et al. 1 introduced a novel realtime multiplex RT-PCR assay that is suitable for intraoperative detection of micrometastasis in SNs for the patients with clinical N0 gastric carcinoma. In the present study, 31% of patients with no metastasis over histological diagnosis were RT-PCR positive and the diagnostic accuracy is significantly higher in their multiplex RT-PCR assay than in intraoperative histopathology. Because the time taken for the assay is just 80 minutes, real-time multiplex RT-PCR is thought to be applicable for use in the intraoperative diagnosis of SN.

"Do We Need Multiple Biopsies for Assessing Gastric Cancer Risk It is widely accepted that differentiated-type gastric cancers evolve through a multistep process starting with Helicobacter pylori-associated superficial gastritis, followed by atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia, and finally carcinoma [1]. Thus, the identification of such precancerous condition and follow-up of patients in whom they are found could lead to the diagnosis of gastric cancer at early stage and improved patient survival. However, diagnosis of atrophy and IM by conventional white light endoscopy has high inter-observer variability [2] and a poor correlation with histological findings [3]. Consequently, the diagnosis of atrophy or IM is currently based on histology of biopsy specimens from certain anatomic locations of the gastric mucosa, i.e., the updated Sydney system [4]. This system recommends taking at least five biopsy specimens (two from the antrum, two from the corpus and one from the incisura angularis) to grade severity of neutrophils (activity) and lymphocytic infiltration (inflammation), glandular atrophy (atrophy), and intestinal metaplasia. A recent Western publication proposes a staging system to classify gastric cancer risk in clinical practice on the basis of the histological findings of multiple biopsies [5]. The reason for taking biopsies from multiple sites in the stomach is that the grade and distribution of gastritis are different at each site of the stomach in a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis. Mapping studies of biopsy findings suggested that chronic atrophic gastritis develops from the lesser curvature of the lower gastric body and extends upward and laterally in the corpus [6]; therefore, knowledge of the biopsy site is important to interpret histological finding of gastritis in multiple biopsy specimens. When we investigated association between gastric cancer risk and histological grade of gastritis at the each biopsy site in the stomach, the presence of IM in the lesser curvature of the corpus had the strongest association with cancer risk among other findings of gastritis in the other sites [7]. Although gastritis is regarded as a histological entity, many attempts have been made to diagnose the disease macroscopically during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Kimura et al. [8] suggested that the endoscopic finding of atrophic mucosa was pale yellowish mucosa with increased mucosal vessel visibility, indicating that it was related to histological finding of atrophy of fundic gland (pseudo-pylorization) by step-wise biopsy across the endoscopic atrophic border. When the atrophic border remained on the lesser curvature of the corpus, the diagnosis was made as closed-type atrophic gastritis (antral predominant gastritis), whereas when the atrophic border no longer exists on the lesser curvature and extends along the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach, the diagnosis was made as open-type atrophic gastritis (pangastritis or corpus predominant gastritis). This endoscopic diagnostic criterion is commonly accepted and practically used for the diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis in Japan. Actually, Uemura et al. [9] indicated that extent of mucosal atrophy diagnosed by endoscopy was associated with risk for development of gastric cancer in a large-scale cohort study. In contrast to point evaluation of gastritis by biopsy, endoscopy is advantageous to evaluate the actual extent and distribution of atrophy or IM in the gastric mucosa that is related to gastric carcinogenesis. Ahn et al. [10] showed that mucosa in patients with open-type atrophic gastritis had more IM and Cdx2 N.

"Is Pylorus-preserving Gastrectomy Universally Applicable to Early Gastric Cancer of the Mid Stomach? Recent advances in endoscopic diagnosis have allowed gastric cancer to be diagnosed early, often in asymptomatic patients. Currently, endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection are accepted as the least invasive procedures when managing early gastric cancer (cT1). An important intermediate option before open gastrectomy is laparoscopic gastrectomy. Advanced laparoscopic gastrectomy contributes to both improved esthetics and earlier postoperative recovery. However, quality of life is mainly affected by late-postoperative phase complications, such as dumping syndrome and loss in body weight resulting from reduced oral intake. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), with limited stomach resection and lymph node dissection, is an example of function-preserving surgery that can improve late-postoperative phase function. In general, PPG is applicable to patients who were preoperatively diagnosed with cT1N0M0 primary gastric cancer in the middle third of the stomach, when the distal tumor border is C4 cm away from the pylorus. During the procedure, infrapyloric vessels are routinely preserved to maintain a suitable blood supply to the pyloric cuff, as is the root of the right gastric artery. Furthermore, the hepatic and pyloric branches of the vagus nerves are routinely preserved. More recently, laparoscopy-assisted pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (LAPPG) with lymphadenectomy has presented an attractive option. Several groups have indicated that LAPPG is a feasible and reliable procedure with satisfactory postoperative symptoms and functional outcomes. However, the incidence of metastasis in the preserved regional lymph nodes remains an obstacle to the wider application of the function-preserving surgery. In particular, lymph nodes at the suprapyloric and infrapyloric stations may be incompletely dissected when preserving nerve and arterial branches in either PPG or LAPPG. Therefore, metastatic tumor in residual suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes may contribute to disease recurrence in patients who undergo PPG. Although several studies have indicated acceptable long-term outcomes and survival rates after both PPG and LAPPG, neither has gained widespread use in standard clinical practice. Recently, Kim et al. attempted to evaluate the status of micrometastasis in suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes in early gastric cancers that are located in the mid stomach and managed with PPG. They found that the mean number of collected suprapyloric lymph nodes was significantly lower after PPG than with conventional distal gastrectomy; the findings were not significant for infrapyloric lymph nodes. Moreover, they determined that all metastasis (both macro and micro) to suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes are essentially very rare and that the long-term survival of patients after PPG was acceptable. They concluded that micrometastasis to the suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes may be negligible, and that PPG may be a safe procedure for early gastric cancer located in the mid stomach. This study essentially supports earlier work evaluating the oncological reliability of PPG. However, this study should be interpreted with caution because it was retrospective in design and involved a single-center cohort with a relatively small number of patients. Furthermore, the study failed to completely assess the primary tumor location (e.g., lesser curvature side, anterior wall). When evaluating a surgical procedure in a single-center study, results can be biased by the surgical skill base at that institution. In particular, LAPPG is a technically difficult surgery for inexperienced surgeons, involving precise Society of Surgical Oncology 2013","is pylorus-preserving gastrectomy universally applicable to early gastric cancer of the mid stomach? recent advances in endoscopic diagnosis have allowed gastric cancer to be diagnosed early, often in asymptomatic patients. currently, endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection are accepted as the least invasive procedures when managing early gastric cancer (ct1). an important intermediate option before open gastrectomy is laparoscopic gastrectomy. advanced laparoscopic gastrectomy contributes to both improved esthetics and earlier postoperative recovery. however, quality of life is mainly affected by late-postoperative phase complications, such as dumping syndrome and loss in body weight resulting from reduced oral intake. pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (ppg), with limited stomach resection and lymph node dissection, is an example of function-preserving surgery that can improve late-postoperative phase function. in general, ppg is applicable to patients who were preoperatively diagnosed with ct1n0m0 primary gastric cancer in the middle third of the stomach, when the distal tumor border is",pylorus preserve gastrectomy universally applicable early gastric mid stomach recent advance endoscopic diagnosis allow gastric diagnose early often asymptomatic currently endoscopic mucosal resection endoscopic submucosal dissection accept least invasive procedure manage early gastric ct important intermediate option open gastrectomy laparoscopic gastrectomy advance laparoscopic gastrectomy contributes improve esthetic earlier postoperative recovery however quality life mainly affect late postoperative phase complication dump syndrome loss body weight result reduce oral intake pylorus preserve gastrectomy ppg limited stomach resection lymph node dissection example function preserve surgery improve late postoperative phase function general ppg applicable preoperatively diagnose ct n primary gastric middle third stomach distal border,d,Stomach Cancer

"Cancer mortality in a Chinese population surrounding a multi-metal sulphide mine in Guangdong province: an ecologic study The Dabaoshan mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province, China, is at high risk of multi-metal pollutant discharge into a local river (Hengshihe) and the surrounding area. Following approximately 30 years of exposure to these metals, little is known regarding the subsequent health effects and risks for the local residents. In our present study, we have estimated the relationships between long-term environmental exposure to multiple heavy metals and the risk of cancer mortality in a Chinese population in the vicinity of Dabaoshan. An ecologic study was performed. Between 2000-2007, a total population of 194,131 lived in the nine agricultural villages that surround the Hengshihe area. Heavy metals concentrations were determined in local environmental samples (water and crops) and whole blood taken from 1152 local residents of both a high-exposure area (HEA) and a low-exposure area (LEA). We calculated the rate ratio and standardized mortality ratios based on age- and gender-specific cancer mortality rates for the different reference populations (based on district, county and province). Simple, multiple linear and ridge regression models were used to evaluate the associations between exposure to multiple heavy metals and cancer mortality in the nine villages, after adjustment for age and sex. The geometric mean blood levels of cadmium and lead were measured at 24.10 μg/L and 38.91 μg/dL for subjects (n = 563) in the HEA and 1.87 μg/L and 4.46 μg/dL for subjects (n = 589) from the LEA, respectively (P < 0.001). The rate of mortality from all cancers in the HEA was substantially elevated in comparison with the corresponding mortality rate in the LEA for men (rate ratio = 2.13; 95% confidence intervals = 1.63 - 2.77) and women (2.83; 1.91 - 4.19); rates were also significantly elevated compared with the rate when compared to the entire Wengyuan County area, or the provincial reference population. In addition, mortality rates were significantly increased for stomach, lung and esophageal cancer in the HEA in comparison with the corresponding rates in the LEA, in Wengyuan County and the provincial reference population for men, women and both combined. Further analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations between exposure to cadmium and lead and the risk of all-cancers and stomach cancer mortality among women and both sexes, whilst zinc exposure showed no association with the risk of site-specific cancer mortality in the nine villages evaluated. The findings of this study reveal probable associations between long-term environmental exposure to both cadmium and lead and an increased risk of mortality from all cancer, as well as from stomach, esophageal and lung-cancers.","cancer mortality in a chinese population surrounding a multi-metal sulphide mine in guangdong province: an ecologic study the dabaoshan mine in the southeast of guangdong province, china, is at high risk of multi-metal pollutant discharge into a local river (hengshihe) and the surrounding area. following approximately 30 years of exposure to these metals, little is known regarding the subsequent health effects and risks for the local residents. in our present study, we have estimated the relationships between long-term environmental exposure to multiple heavy metals and the risk of cancer mortality in a chinese population in the vicinity of dabaoshan. an ecologic study was performed. between 2000-2007, a total population of 194,131 lived in the nine agricultural villages that surround the hengshihe area. heavy metals concentrations were determined in local environmental samples (water and crops) and whole blood taken from 1152 local residents of both a high-exposure area (hea) and a",mortality chinese population surround multi metal sulphide mine guangdong province ecologic dabaoshan mine southeast guangdong province china high risk multi metal pollutant discharge local river hengshihe surround area follow approximately year exposure metal little know regard subsequent health effect risk local resident present estimate relationship long term environmental exposure multiple heavy metal risk mortality chinese population vicinity dabaoshan ecologic perform total population live nine agricultural village surround hengshihe area heavy metal concentration determine local environmental sample water crop whole blood take local resident high exposure area hea,d,Stomach Cancer
"Pain in carcinoma of the stomach: Preliminary report In this paper we have attempted to outline in a general way the important pathways of conduction of pain from, and mechanics of production of pain in, the viscera in the upper part of the abdomen. The general principles involved follow a pattern similar to that encountered in cases of benign lesions of the stomach. We felt that, if gastric carcinoma superficially invades the tissues of the stomach and results in disturbances of its normal mechanics, pain may result. This pain would utilize pathways coursing along the splanchnic vessels. In order to be interpreted as pain, these irregularities in mechanics would require an “adequate” stimulus which, in this case, would be spasm or obstruction. If, on the other hand, the lesion burrows through the gastric wall into the tissues surrounding the organ, pain would be relayed to the spinal cord over the spinal sensory group of nerves and, in this instance, wide distribution and reference of pain may be produced. If the lesion invades the regions of the distribution of the phrenic nerve, pain will be referred into the left side of the thorax and to the “peripheral distribution” of this nerve which would be into the left shoulder and the base of the neck. Such a lesion is usually inoperable. Any stimulus which would initiate the sensation of pain on surfaces of the body also could produce pain in penetrating lesions. Applying these hypotheses to the problem of pain in cases of cancer of the stomach permits an explanation of the apparent paradoxical behavior of distress among patients harboring such lesions. Who, at operation or necropsy has not viewed with surprise tremendous cancers involving most of the stomach which have produced no pain whatsoever? After all, this should be no more the cause of astonishment than to witness surgical procedures on the stomach which caused patients no pain even though only local anesthesia was used. The mechanisms which produce pain in such cases depend on the production of an adequate stimulus, such as stretching or constriction of the circular muscular fibers which would require a mechanical disturbance, such as spasm or obstruction. If cancer does not set in motion this adequate stimulus, it is likely to produce no pain whatsoever. If, on the other hand, there is mechanical disturbance such as interference with normal emptying or invasion of the pylorus, pain or at least a sense of epigastric distress is likely to be one of the earlier manifestations of this disease.","pain in carcinoma of the stomach: preliminary report in this paper we have attempted to outline in a general way the important pathways of conduction of pain from, and mechanics of production of pain in, the viscera in the upper part of the abdomen. the general principles involved follow a pattern similar to that encountered in cases of benign lesions of the stomach. we felt that, if gastric carcinoma superficially invades the tissues of the stomach and results in disturbances of its normal mechanics, pain may result. this pain would utilize pathways coursing along the splanchnic vessels. in order to be interpreted as pain, these irregularities in mechanics would require an “adequate” stimulus which, in this case, would be spasm or obstruction. if, on the other hand, the lesion burrows through the gastric wall into the tissues surrounding the organ, pain would be relayed to the spinal cord over the",pain carcinoma stomach preliminary report paper attempt outline general way important pathway conduction pain mechanic production pain viscera upper part abdomen general principle involve follow pattern similar encounter benign lesion stomach felt gastric carcinoma superficially invade tissue stomach result disturbance normal mechanic pain may result pain would utilize pathway course along splanchnic vessel order interpret pain irregularity mechanic would require adequate stimulus would spasm obstruction hand lesion burrow gastric wall tissue surround organ pain would relay spinal cord,d,Stomach Cancer
"Malignant Gastrocolic Fistula as a Late Complication of Radiation Therapy Malignant gastrocolic fistula is a rare mode of presentation of gastric or colonic carcinoma [1–3]. A benign aetiology is more common, including peptic ulcer disease, particularly benign gastric ulcers which may relate to non-steroidal antiinflammatory use. Other benign causes include inflammatory bowel disease, post-PEG insertion, post-gastroenterostomy, pancreatitis, abdominal tuberculosis, trauma, perforated diverticular disease and infections including CMV, histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, amoebiasis, echinococcosis and lymphogranuloma venereum [2, 4–7]. A malignant gastrocolic fistula is most commonly found between the greater curvature of the stomach and the distal half of the transverse colon [8]. They are usually seen in the setting of large infiltrative tumours with a surrounding inflammatory reaction, and lymph node involvement is uncommon [8]. The colon rather than the stomach is the more usual site of origin. In a review of 1,500 cases of stomach cancer and 3,200 cases of colon cancer at the Lahey Clinic, 11 cases of gastrocolic fistula were reported, with 10 being of colonic origin [9]. Radiation therapy is associated with an increased risk of second cancers. Abdominal radiation therapy has been most frequently administered in the context of testicular cancer, where the overall cure rate is greater than 90 % [10]. The average age of presentation of testicular cancer is 35, and second neoplasms are uncommon but well-recognised complications where radiation therapy has been given [11–14]. Exposure to radiation may induce a broad variety of DNA damage including singleand double-stranded DNA breaks, cross-linking and damage to nucleotide bases [15]. Radiation-related genomic instability enhances the rate at which mutations and epigenetic changes are acquired in the descendants of that cell line after many generations of replication. In a cohort study of 40, 576 survivors of testicular cancer, Travis et al. reported on 2,285 second solid tumours observed where 1,619 new cancers were expected, demonstrating an elevated relative risk (ERR) as well as an excess absolute risk of developing a second neoplasm in comparison with the general population [16]. A further report of 5,142 patients treated with radiation therapy describes a 3.4fold increased risk of stomach cancer in survivors of testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma [17]. This study found that the risk of second cancer begins approximately 10– 15 years after the original cancer diagnosis. We report herein a case of an adenocarcinoma presenting acutely as a J.

"Cancer incidence in England and Wales and New Zealand and in migrants between the two countries. Risks of cancer incidence in people born in England and Wales and New Zealand (non-Maoris) living in their home countries, and after migration between the two countries, were analysed using data from their national cancer registries. Since these populations are of similar genetic origin, any real differences in cancer incidence between them are likely to reflect the action of environmental or behavioural risk factors. The greatest differences in risk between the countries were for cutaneous melanoma and lip cancer. In each sex, relative risks of these malignancies were 4 or greater for the New Zealand-born in New Zealand compared with English and Welsh natives in their home country, and risks for migrants in each direction were generally intermediate between those born in the home country in the two countries. Sizeable significantly raised risks in the New Zealand-born in New Zealand compared with English and Welsh natives in England and Wales also occurred for cancers of the mouth, small intestine, colon, thymus, eye and thyroid, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in each sex, and for cancer of the prostate. For all of these sites except mouth, small intestine and colon there were also risks around or above New Zealand-born levels for English and Welsh migrants to New Zealand; for colon cancer these migrants had risks close to those in England and Wales. New Zealand migrants to England and Wales had risks of cancers of the colon and prostate that were similar to or above New Zealand levels. Risks of cancers of the stomach, lung, pleura and bladder, and Hodgkin's disease in each sex, and cancers of the cervix, ovary and scrotum and penis, were substantially and significantly lower in the New Zealand-born living in New Zealand than in English and Welsh natives in England and Wales. In English and Welsh migrants to New Zealand risks of bladder cancer in each sex, and of scrotal and penile and pleural cancer in males, approximated to England and Wales risks; cervical cancer risk approximated to the New Zealand risk; and stomach, lung and ovarian cancers showed intermediate risks.

"Identification of HDAC9 as a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a new class of anticancer drugs confirmed to have good therapeutic effects against gastric cancer (GC) in preclinical experiments, but most HDACis are non-selective (pan-HDACis), with highly toxic side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to screen HDAC family members that play key roles in GC as therapeutic targets to reduce toxic side effects. In this study, we evaluated the targeting specificity of the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for GC via fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI). In vitro FMI results showed that SAHA had higher binding affinity for GC cells than for normal gastric cells. In vivo FMI of gastric tumor-bearing mice confirmed that SAHA can be enriched in GC tissues. However, there was also a high-concentration distribution in normal organs such as the stomach and lungs, suggesting potential side effects. In addition, we found that among the HDAC family members, HDAC9 was the most significantly upregulated in GC cells, and we verified this upregulation in GC tissues. Further experiments confirmed that knockdown of HDAC9 inhibits cell growth, reduces colony formation, and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that HDAC9 has an oncogenic role in GC. Moreover, HDAC9 siRNA suppressed GC tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in GC treatment by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that the development of HDAC9-selective HDACis is a potential approach to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce systemic toxicity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), a protein that regulates gene expression, reduces stomach cancer cell growth. The efficacy of current treatments for stomach cancer is limited. Although HDACs have emerged as promising therapeutic targets, non-selective HDAC inhibitors can cause severe side effects. Shigang Ding at Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing, China, and colleagues found that human stomach cancer cells have significantly higher levels of HDAC9 than other members of the HDAC family and that high HDAC9 levels are associated with reduced patient survival. Interfering with the production of HDAC9 protein improved the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in mice with stomach cancer. The authors suggest that selective HDAC9 inhibitors could help to improve the survival of patients with this type of cancer.","identification of hdac9 as a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer. histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdacis) are a new class of anticancer drugs confirmed to have good therapeutic effects against gastric cancer (gc) in preclinical experiments, but most hdacis are non-selective (pan-hdacis), with highly toxic side effects. therefore, it is necessary to screen hdac family members that play key roles in gc as therapeutic targets to reduce toxic side effects. in this study, we evaluated the targeting specificity of the hdaci suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha) for gc via fluorescence molecular imaging (fmi). in vitro fmi results showed that saha had higher binding affinity for gc cells than for normal gastric cells. in vivo fmi of gastric tumor-bearing mice confirmed that saha can be enriched in gc tissues. however, there was also a high-concentration distribution in normal organs such as the stomach and lungs, suggesting potential side effects. in",identification hdac viable therapeutic target gastric histone deacetylase inhibitor hdacis new class anticancer drug confirm good therapeutic effect gastric gc preclinical experiment hdacis non selective pan hdacis highly toxic side effect therefore necessary screen hdac family member play key role gc therapeutic target reduce toxic side effect evaluate target specificity hdaci suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid saha gc via fluorescence molecular image fmi vitro fmi result show saha high binding affinity gc cell normal gastric cell vivo fmi gastric bearing mouse confirm saha enrich gc tissue however also high concentration distribution normal organ stomach lung suggest potential side effect,d,Stomach Cancer

"Association of Helicobacter Pylori in Carcinoma Stomach at Maharaja Krishna Chandra Gajapat Medical College: A Prospective Study. Introduction Gastric cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The etiology of gastric cancer includes <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, diet, lifestyle, tobacco, alcohol, and genetic susceptibility. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) is the most effective method for examining the upper gastrointestinal tract as compared to the other examination tools. Objective To study the histopathological finding of upper gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsies and its association with <i>H. pylori</i> in cases of carcinoma stomach. Materials and methods This was a hospital-based observational study carried out in the Department of Surgery, at Maharaja Krushna Chandra Gajapati Medical College, Berhampur, a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India. Study population consisted of 106 patients for a period of 2 years from July 2019 to June 2021, after due consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Endoscopic location and pathological types of the gastric lesion were noted, and all biopsy specimens were investigated to see the presence of <i>H. pylori</i> by rapid urease test (RUT) and histological examination in the form of Giemsa and H&E stain. Results In the present study of 106 cases, 62 cases (58.49%) were found to be positive for <i>H. Pylori</i> by RUT and 72 cases (67.92%) were positive for <i>H. pylori</i> by smear staining. In histopathological study, 72 cases (67.92%) were of intestinal type of carcinoma and 34 cases (32.07%) were of diffuse type of carcinoma. Smear for <i>H</i> <i>. pylori</i> was positive in 56 cases (77.78%) among the 72 cases of intestinal type of carcinoma stomach. Whereas only 16 cases (47.05%) were found to be smear-positive for <i>H. pylori</i> among the 34 cases of diffuse type of lesion. Irrespective of histological type, <i>H. pylori</i> was positive in 67.92% of patients with carcinoma stomach. This association was statistically significant (p<0.001) and indicates its role in intestinal type of gastric carcinoma. Conclusion There is a high frequency of <i>H. pylori</i> infection in cases of stomach cancer. This study confirmed the higher association of <i>H. pylori</i> infection with gastric cancer. Its association with the intestinal histological variety of stomach cancer is more common than diffuse type.

"Endoscopic evaluation of the remnant stomach after gastrectomy: proposal for a new classification. Conclusion. The classification (RGB classification: Residue, Gastritis, Bile) can be used easily and is practical. The results suggest some important differences among methods of recon- struction. This classification seems to be useful to describe these findings and to further evaluate these reconstructive methods. Abstract Background. In Japan, approximately half of gastric cancers are diagnosed in the early stage. Longer survival has been provided for patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). Several new surgical procedures have been employed for some EGCs. To compare the functional results of these techniques with those of classic distal gastrectomy, it is important to evaluate the remnant stomach in relation to quality of life (QOL) and secondary cancers. We propose a new endoscopic classifi- cation, regarding several aspects of the remnant stomach, which enables common understanding and description of the condition. Methods. Of 651 patients who underwent a distal gastrectomy or pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), 324 had at least one upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy during the follow- up period. Ninety-three of the 324 patients underwent a Roux- en-Y reconstruction (RY); 175, Billroth type 1 (B1); and 56, PPG. Endoscopic findings regarding residual food, gastritis, and bile reflux in the gastric stump were investigated for these patients. We classified the amount of residual food into five grades, the degree and the extent of gastritis into five grades, and bile reflux into two grades. First, we evaluated the consis- tency of diagnosis between two endoscopists, in the first 200 patients, and then we applied the classification to all 324 pa- tients to examine the usefulness of this classification. Results. Consistency of diagnosis was obtained between two endoscopists who classified the patients independently. The agreement rate was 98.5% for residual food, 93% for gastritis, and 100% for bile reflux. Residual food was observed in 14.0% of the RY group, 22.3% of the B1 group, and 37.5% of the PPG group. These differences were significant (RY versus B1; P < 0.05 and RY versus PPG; P < 0.01). The remnant stomach after B1 showed significantly more severe and exten- sive gastritis than that after RY and PPG (P < 0.01). As for bile reflux, there was no significant difference among the three groups.","endoscopic evaluation of the remnant stomach after gastrectomy: proposal for a new classification. conclusion. the classification (rgb classification: residue, gastritis, bile) can be used easily and is practical. the results suggest some important differences among methods of recon- struction. this classification seems to be useful to describe these findings and to further evaluate these reconstructive methods. abstract background. in japan, approximately half of gastric cancers are diagnosed in the early stage. longer survival has been provided for patients with early gastric cancer (egc). several new surgical procedures have been employed for some egcs. to compare the functional results of these techniques with those of classic distal gastrectomy, it is important to evaluate the remnant stomach in relation to quality of life (qol) and secondary cancers. we propose a new endoscopic classifi- cation, regarding several aspects of the remnant stomach, which enables common understanding and description of the condition. methods. of",endoscopic evaluation remnant stomach gastrectomy proposal new classification conclusion classification rgb classification residue gastritis bile use easily practical result suggest important difference among method recon struction classification seem useful describe finding evaluate reconstructive method abstract japan approximately half gastric diagnose early stage longer survival provide early gastric egc several new surgical procedure employ egcs compare functional result technique classic distal gastrectomy important evaluate remnant stomach relation quality life qol secondary propose new endoscopic classifi cation regard several aspect remnant stomach enable common understanding description condition method,d,Stomach Cancer

"Critical review of the epidemiology literature on the potential cancer risks of methyl methacrylate. Objective: To critically review and summarise all of the available epidemiological evidence, both published and unpublished, to date on the carcinogenicity of methyl methacrylate (MMA) to humans. Methods: The review focused on studies of cast acrylic sheet manufacturing workers because this industry has historically had a potential for exposure to high levels of MMA. The majority of papers for review were identified through Medline (National Library of Medicine) but there is some discussion of two cohort studies and a nested case–control study, which to date have not been published. Results: An increased risk of colorectal cancer was reported in one group of workers highly exposed to MMA and ethyl acrylate (EA) in the manufacture of acrylic sheet. Analysis of colon cancer by cumulative exposure to MMA indicated that the excess was largely confined to the group with the highest exposure. However, a large excess of colon cancer deaths occurred among workers who never worked in a job entailing more than minimal exposure. Studies of other large occupational cohorts of workers potentially exposed to MMA, including some with potentially comparable exposures, have failed to strengthen the evidence that there is a causal association between colorectal cancer and MMA exposure although one reported an excess that did not appear to be exposure-related. Excesses of cancers of the respiratory system and stomach were seen in some cohorts, but not among the acrylic sheet workers who had the increased risk of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: Excesses of respiratory, stomach and colorectal cancers were observed in some cohorts of workers exposed to MMA. There was little to suggest that MMA exposure was responsible for the excesses of respiratory and stomach cancer and it is more likely that they resulted from unexplained contributions of lifestyle exposures such as cigarette smoking and diet. An excess of colorectal cancer in one group of workers exposed to high levels of MMA and EA during the 1930s and 1940s remains unexplained. However, the lack of consistency in the results of various studies, the absence of dose response and the lack of support from animal toxicology do not provide persuasive evidence that exposure to MMA is a human carcinogen.","critical review of the epidemiology literature on the potential cancer risks of methyl methacrylate. objective: to critically review and summarise all of the available epidemiological evidence, both published and unpublished, to date on the carcinogenicity of methyl methacrylate (mma) to humans. methods: the review focused on studies of cast acrylic sheet manufacturing workers because this industry has historically had a potential for exposure to high levels of mma. the majority of papers for review were identified through medline (national library of medicine) but there is some discussion of two cohort studies and a nested case–control study, which to date have not been published. results: an increased risk of colorectal cancer was reported in one group of workers highly exposed to mma and ethyl acrylate (ea) in the manufacture of acrylic sheet. analysis of colon cancer by cumulative exposure to mma indicated that the excess was largely confined to the group",critical review epidemiology literature potential risk methyl methacrylate critically review summarise available epidemiological evidence publish unpublished date carcinogenicity methyl methacrylate mma human method review focus cast acrylic sheet manufacturing worker industry historically potential exposure high level mma majority paper review identify medline national library medicine discussion two cohort nested control date publish result increased risk colorectal report one group worker highly expose mma ethyl acrylate ea manufacture acrylic sheet colon cumulative exposure mma indicated excess largely confine group,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer incidence in eastern Morocco: cancer patterns and incidence trends, 2005–2012 Cancer is one of the major health problems worldwide. In this article, we present for the first time the cancer incidence trends, the distribution and the socioeconomic profile of incident cancer cases in Eastern Morocco over a period of eight years. Retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with cancer at the Hassan II Regional Oncology Center (ROC) since it was created in October 2005 until December 2012. During the study period, the ROC was the only hospital specialized in cancer care in Eastern Morocco. A total of 7872 incident cases of cancer were registered in Eastern Morocco. Among these incident cases 5220 cases were women and 2652 were men, with a female to male ratio of 1.97. The mean age at diagnosis was 58 years for males and 52 for females and 94% of the patients aged over 30 years. For both sexes combined and for all cancer sites, breast cancer was the commonest followed by cervix uteri, colon-rectum, lung, nasopharynx, and stomach cancers. The most common cancer in women was breast cancer, followed respectively by cervix uteri cancer, colon-rectum cancer, ovary cancer, and stomach cancer. In men, the lung cancer ranked first, followed respectively by colon-rectum cancer, nasopharynx cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. For most cancers, crude incidence rates (CR) have increased significantly. The CR for all cancers combined has increased from 56.6 to 80.3 per 100,000 females and from 32.3 to 42.6 per 100,000 males during the study period. Patients profile analysis showed that 79% of cancer patients were from urban areas, 83% were unemployed and 85% had no health insurance. The distribution of cancers in Eastern Morocco is different from those observed in other regions of Morocco. Unlike most countries, women were much more affected with cancer than men in Eastern Morocco. More importantly, the rates of many cancers are rising. Therefore, our data justify the need to develop effective programs for cancer control and prevention in Eastern Morocco. A better access to cancer care should be a priority of the health policies, given that the majority of cancer patients in Eastern Morocco are unemployed, and do not have medical care coverage.","cancer incidence in eastern morocco: cancer patterns and incidence trends, 2005–2012 cancer is one of the major health problems worldwide. in this article, we present for the first time the cancer incidence trends, the distribution and the socioeconomic profile of incident cancer cases in eastern morocco over a period of eight years. retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with cancer at the hassan ii regional oncology center (roc) since it was created in october 2005 until december 2012. during the study period, the roc was the only hospital specialized in cancer care in eastern morocco. a total of 7872 incident cases of cancer were registered in eastern morocco. among these incident cases 5220 cases were women and 2652 were men, with a female to male ratio of 1.97. the mean age at diagnosis was 58 years for males and 52 for females and 94% of the patients aged over 30",incidence eastern morocco pattern incidence trend one major health problem worldwide article present first time incidence trend distribution socioeconomic profile incident eastern morocco period eight year retrospective descriptive diagnose hassan ii regional oncology center roc since create october december period roc hospital specialize care eastern morocco total incident register eastern morocco among incident woman men female male ratio mean age diagnosis year male female age,d,Stomach Cancer
"A retrospective cohort study of patients with stomach and liver cancers: the impact of comorbidity and ethnicity on cancer care and outcomes. Background: Comorbidity has an adverse impact on cancer survival partly through its negative impact on receipt of curative treatment. Comorbidity is unevenly distributed within populations, with some ethnic and socioeconomic groups having considerably higher burden. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships between comorbidity, ethnicity, receipt of treatment, and cancer survival among patients with stomach and liver cancer in New Zealand. Methods: Using the New Zealand Cancer Registry, Māori patients diagnosed with stomach and liver cancers were identified (n = 269), and compared with a randomly selected group of non-Māori patients (n = 255). Clinical and outcome data were collected from medical records, and the administrative hospitalisation and mortality databases. Logistic and Cox regression modelling with multivariable adjustment were used to examine the impacts of ethnicity and comorbidity on receipt of treatment, and the impact of these variables on all-cause and cancer specific survival. Results: More than 70% of patients had died by two years post-diagnosis. As comorbidity burden increased among those with Stage I-III disease, the likelihood that the patient would receive curative surgery decreased (e.g. C3 Index score 6 vs 0, adjusted OR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.78) and risk of mortality increased (e.g. C3 Index score 6 vs 0, adjusted all-cause HR: 1.44, 95% CI 0.93-2.23). Receipt of curative surgery reduced this excess mortality, in some cases substantially; but the extent to which this occurred varied by level of comorbidity. Māori patients had somewhat higher levels of comorbidity (34% in highest comorbidity category compared with 23% for non-Māori) and poorer survival that was not explained by age, sex, site, stage, comorbidity or receipt of curative surgery (adjusted cancer-specific HR: 1.36, 95% CI 0.97-1.90; adjusted all-cause HR: 1.33, 95% CI 0.97-1.82). Access to healthcare factors accounted for 25-36% of this survival difference. Conclusions: Patients with comorbidity were substantially less likely to receive curative surgery and more likely to die than those without comorbidity. Receipt of curative surgery markedly reduced their excess mortality. Despite no discernible difference in likelihood of curative treatment receipt, Māori remained more likely to die than non-Māori even after adjusting for confounding and mediating variables.","a retrospective cohort study of patients with stomach and liver cancers: the impact of comorbidity and ethnicity on cancer care and outcomes. background: comorbidity has an adverse impact on cancer survival partly through its negative impact on receipt of curative treatment. comorbidity is unevenly distributed within populations, with some ethnic and socioeconomic groups having considerably higher burden. the aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships between comorbidity, ethnicity, receipt of treatment, and cancer survival among patients with stomach and liver cancer in new zealand. methods: using the new zealand cancer registry, māori patients diagnosed with stomach and liver cancers were identified (n = 269), and compared with a randomly selected group of non-māori patients (n = 255). clinical and outcome data were collected from medical records, and the administrative hospitalisation and mortality databases. logistic and cox regression modelling with multivariable adjustment were used to examine the impacts of",retrospective cohort stomach liver impact comorbidity ethnicity care outcome comorbidity adverse impact survival partly negative impact receipt curative comorbidity unevenly distribute within population ethnic socioeconomic group considerably high burden investigate inter relationship comorbidity ethnicity receipt survival among stomach liver new zealand method use new zealand registry ori diagnose stomach liver identify n compare randomly select group non ori n outcome data collect medical record administrative hospitalisation mortality database logistic cox regression model multivariable adjustment use examine impact,d,Stomach Cancer
"Perception of cancer in patients diagnosed with the most common gastrointestinal cancers Gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer are among the most common cancers in Poland. Cancer patients usually assess their quality of life much worse than the general population, while negative emotions associated with the illness may affect the results of treatment. The study involved 378 patients with colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer, treated as outpatients at the Oncology Center - Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute in Warsaw in 2013–2018. Standardized tools were used in the study: the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire (BPCQ), the Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), Approval Illness Scale (AIS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MiniMAC). The main goal of the study was to assess pain control, pain management strategies, illness acceptance and adaptation to cancer in patients with the most common gastrointestinal cancers. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers ascribe the greatest role in controlling pain to internal factors (M = 16.84, SE = .34), and the highest score in this area was obtained by patients with colorectal cancer (M = 17.33, SE = .35). The most frequently chosen strategy is declaring coping (M = 20.95, SE = .57), although patients with pancreatic cancer obtained a high score also in the area of catastrophizing (M = 17.99, SE = 1.14). The average value of illness acceptance for patients with gastrointestinal cancers was M = 25.00 (SE = .50) and it was the lowest in the group of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (M = 23.41, SE = 1.16), and the highest in a group of people with colorectal cancer (M = 27.76, SE = .51). Patients with gastrointestinal cancers obtained the highest values of the MiniMAC test in the area of the fighting spirit (M = 21.30, SE = .25), characteristic mainly for patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer were characterized by high anxiety and helplessness/hopelessness. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers use different methods of pain control and pain coping strategies, with active behaviors being preferred by patients with colorectal cancer and destructive - by patients with pancreatic cancer. The majority of socio-economic variables, as well as the treatment method, affect the patients’ behaviors.","perception of cancer in patients diagnosed with the most common gastrointestinal cancers gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer are among the most common cancers in poland. cancer patients usually assess their quality of life much worse than the general population, while negative emotions associated with the illness may affect the results of treatment. the study involved 378 patients with colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer, treated as outpatients at the oncology center - maria sklodowska-curie institute in warsaw in 2013–2018. standardized tools were used in the study: the beliefs about pain control questionnaire (bpcq), the pain coping strategies questionnaire (csq), approval illness scale (ais), mental adjustment to cancer (minimac). the main goal of the study was to assess pain control, pain management strategies, illness acceptance and adaptation to cancer in patients with the most common gastrointestinal cancers. patients with gastrointestinal cancers ascribe the greatest role",perception diagnose common gastrointestinal gastrointestinal include colorectal stomach pancreatic among common poland usually assess quality life much bad general population negative emotion associate illness may affect result involve colorectal stomach pancreatic treat outpatient oncology center maria sklodowska curie institute warsaw standardized tool use belief pain control questionnaire bpcq pain cop strategy questionnaire csq approval illness scale ai mental adjustment minimac main goal assess pain control pain management strategy illness acceptance adaptation common gastrointestinal gastrointestinal ascribe great role,d,Stomach Cancer
"Induction of chromosome instability and stomach cancer by altering the expression pattern of mitotic checkpoint genes in mice exposed to areca-nut There are strong indications for a causal association between areca-nut consumption and cancers. In Meghalaya, India, the variety of areca-nut is used as raw and unprocessed form whose chemical composition and pharmacological actions have been reported. Yet we know little on the initial pathway involved in areca-nut associated carcinogenesis since it is difficult to assess its effects on genetic alterations without interference of other compounding factors. Therefore, present study was undertaken in mice to verify the ability of raw areca-nut (RAN) to induce cancer and to monitor the expression of certain genes involved in carcinogenesis. This study was not intended to isolate any active ingredients from the RAN and to look its action. Three groups of mice (n = 25 in each) were taken and used at different time-points for different experimental analysis. The other three groups of mice (n = 15 in each) were considered for tumor induction studies. In each set, two groups were administered RAN-extract ad libitum in drinking water with or without lime. The expression of certain genes was assessed by conventional RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The mice were given the whole RAN-extract with and without lime in order to mimic the human consumption style of RAN. Histological preparation of stomach tissue revealed that RAN induced stomach cancer. A gradual increase in the frequency of precocious anaphase and aneuploid cells was observed in the bone marrow cells with a greater increment following RAN + lime administeration. Levels of p53, Bax, Securin and p65 in esophageal and stomach cells were elevated during early days of RAN exposure while those of different mitotic checkpoint proteins were downregulated. Apoptotic cell death was detected in non-cancerous stomach cells but not in tumor cells which showed overexpression of Bax and absence of PARP. Present study suggested (a) RAN induces stomach cancer, however, presence of lime promoted higher cell transformation and thereby developed cancer earlier, (b) perturbations in components of the chromosome segregation machinery could be involved in the initial process of carcinogenicity and (c) the importance of precocious anaphase as a screening marker for identification of mitotic checkpoint defects during early days.","induction of chromosome instability and stomach cancer by altering the expression pattern of mitotic checkpoint genes in mice exposed to areca-nut there are strong indications for a causal association between areca-nut consumption and cancers. in meghalaya, india, the variety of areca-nut is used as raw and unprocessed form whose chemical composition and pharmacological actions have been reported. yet we know little on the initial pathway involved in areca-nut associated carcinogenesis since it is difficult to assess its effects on genetic alterations without interference of other compounding factors. therefore, present study was undertaken in mice to verify the ability of raw areca-nut (ran) to induce cancer and to monitor the expression of certain genes involved in carcinogenesis. this study was not intended to isolate any active ingredients from the ran and to look its action. three groups of mice (n = 25 in each) were taken and used at different time-points",induction chromosome instability stomach alter expression pattern mitotic checkpoint gene mouse expose areca nut strong indication causal association areca nut consumption meghalaya india variety areca nut use raw unprocessed form whose chemical composition pharmacological action report yet know little initial pathway involve areca nut associate carcinogenesis since difficult assess effect genetic alteration without interference compound factor therefore present undertake mouse verify ability raw areca nut run induce monitor expression certain gene involve carcinogenesis intend isolate active ingredient ran look action three group mouse n take use different time point,d,Stomach Cancer

"Reanalysis of cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to low doses of radiation: bootstrap and simulation methods The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended annual occupational dose limit is 20 mSv. Cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to less than 20 mSv external radiation in 1945 was analysed previously, using a latency model with non-linear dose response. Questions were raised regarding statistical inference with this model. Cancers with over 100 deaths in the 0 - 20 mSv subcohort of the 1950-1990 Life Span Study are analysed with Poisson regression models incorporating latency, allowing linear and non-linear dose response. Bootstrap percentile and Bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) methods and simulation of the Likelihood Ratio Test lead to Confidence Intervals for Excess Relative Risk (ERR) and tests against the linear model. The linear model shows significant large, positive values of ERR for liver and urinary cancers at latencies from 37 - 43 years. Dose response below 20 mSv is strongly non-linear at the optimal latencies for the stomach (11.89 years), liver (36.9), lung (13.6), leukaemia (23.66), and pancreas (11.86) and across broad latency ranges. Confidence Intervals for ERR are comparable using Bootstrap and Likelihood Ratio Test methods and BCa 95% Confidence Intervals are strictly positive across latency ranges for all 5 cancers. Similar risk estimates for 10 mSv (lagged dose) are obtained from the 0 - 20 mSv and 5 - 500 mSv data for the stomach, liver, lung and leukaemia. Dose response for the latter 3 cancers is significantly non-linear in the 5 - 500 mSv range. Liver and urinary cancer mortality risk is significantly raised using a latency model with linear dose response. A non-linear model is strongly superior for the stomach, liver, lung, pancreas and leukaemia. Bootstrap and Likelihood-based confidence intervals are broadly comparable and ERR is strictly positive by bootstrap methods for all 5 cancers. Except for the pancreas, similar estimates of latency and risk from 10 mSv are obtained from the 0 - 20 mSv and 5 - 500 mSv subcohorts.

"Frequent loss of RUNX3 gene expression in remnant stomach cancer and adjacent mucosa with special reference to topography Our previous studies suggest that a lack of RUNX3 function is causally related to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer. This study was conducted to determine whether alteration of RUNX3 gene expression could be detected in the normal-looking gastric remnant mucosa, and to ascertain any difference in the potential of gastric carcinogenesis between the anastomotic site and other areas in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for peptic ulcer (RB group) or gastric cancer (RM group), by analysing RUNX3 expression with special reference to topography. A total of 89 patients underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer from the intact stomach (GCI group) and 58 patients underwent resection of the remnant stomach for gastric cancer (RB group: 34 cases, RM group: 24 cases). We detected RUNX3 and gene promoter methylation by in situ hybridisation, quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), and methylation-specific PCR. The interval between the initial surgery and surgery for remnant gastric cancer (interval time) was 10.4 years in the RM group, and 27.5 years in the RB group. Cancers in the RB group were significantly more predominant in the anastomosis area (P<0.05). Within the tumour, downregulation of RUNX3 expression ranged from 74.7 to 85.7% in the three groups. The rate of downregulation of RUNX3 of adjacent mucosa was 39.2% (11 in 28 cases) in RB and 47.6% (10 in 21 cases) in RM, which are significantly higher than that of the GCI group (19.5%, 17 in 87 cases). In noncancerous mucosa of the remnant stomach in the RB group, RUNX3 expression decreased more near the anastomosis area. In the RM group, however, there were no significant differences in RUNX3 expression by sampling location. Based on RUNX3 downregulation and clinical features, residual stomach mucosa of the RM group would have a higher potential of gastric carcinogenesis compared to the RB or GCI group.

"Cancer incidence in Arkhangelskaja Oblast in northwestern Russia. The Arkhangelsk Cancer Registry Data concerning incidence and prevalence of cancer in the different regions of Russia have traditionally not been provided on a basis that facilitated comparison with data from countries in western parts of Europe. The oncological hospital in Arkhangelsk, in co-operation with Universitetet i Tromso (Norway), has established a population based cancer registry for Arkhangelskaja Oblast (AO). AO is an administrative unit with 1.3 million inhabitants in northwestern Russia. The aim of this investigation was to assess the content and quality of the AO cancer registry (AKR), and to present the site-specific cancer-incidence rates in AO in the period 1993–2001. The population in this study consisted of all individuals registered as residents of AO. All new cancer cases in the period 1993 – 2001, registered the AKR, were included in the study (ICD-10: C00-C95, except for C77-78). The annual gender and age-group-specific population figures were obtained from the AO statistics office. A total of 34 697 cases of primary cancers were included. The age-adjusted (world standard) incidence rate for all sites combined was 164/100 000 for women and 281/100 000 for men. The highest incidence was for cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung (16.3% of all cases), whereof 88.6 % of the cases were among men. Among women, cancer of the breast constituted 15.9 percent of all cases. The age-adjusted incidences of the most frequent cancer sites among men were: lung (77.4/100 000); stomach (45.9); rectum (13.4); oesophagus (13.0); colon (12.2); bladder (11.6); and prostate cancer (11.1). Among women they were: breast (28.5); stomach (19.7); colon (12.2); and ovary cancer (9.0). Our findings confirm and strengthen the indication that the incidences of stomach, larynx, liver, pancreas, prostate, colon, bladder and melanoma cancer are quite different in male populations in Russia compared to many other European countries. Among women, most major cancer types, except stomach, appear to be relatively low in Russian populations. The AKR provides quality data for estimations and insight to the cancer incidence in a northern Russian population, and we consider the reported incidence rates to reflect the cancer situation in AO well.","cancer incidence in arkhangelskaja oblast in northwestern russia. the arkhangelsk cancer registry data concerning incidence and prevalence of cancer in the different regions of russia have traditionally not been provided on a basis that facilitated comparison with data from countries in western parts of europe. the oncological hospital in arkhangelsk, in co-operation with universitetet i tromso (norway), has established a population based cancer registry for arkhangelskaja oblast (ao). ao is an administrative unit with 1.3 million inhabitants in northwestern russia. the aim of this investigation was to assess the content and quality of the ao cancer registry (akr), and to present the site-specific cancer-incidence rates in ao in the period 1993–2001. the population in this study consisted of all individuals registered as residents of ao. all new cancer cases in the period 1993 – 2001, registered the akr, were included in the study (icd-10: c00-c95, except for c77-78). the annual",incidence arkhangelskaja oblast northwestern russia arkhangelsk registry data concern incidence prevalence different region russia traditionally provide basis facilitate comparison data country western part europe oncological hospital arkhangelsk co operation universitetet tromso norway establish population base registry arkhangelskaja oblast ao ao administrative unit million inhabitant northwestern russia investigation assess content quality ao registry akr present site specific incidence rate ao period population consist individual register resident ao new period register akr include icd c c except c annual,d,Stomach Cancer

"SEREX analysis of gastric cancer antigens Stomach cancer is the major malignancy in Japan and one of the most common cancers worldwide. To establish the basis for an immunotherapeutic approach to stomach cancer, we have initiated an analysis of stomach cancer antigens recognized by human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SE-REX, a powerful expression cloning method developed by Dr. M. Pfreundschuh's group. Five stomach cancer cDNA libraries have been screened with autologous patient sera: one moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; two poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas; and two scirrhous-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of Borrmann type 4, the most devastating form of stomach cancer. Based on the reactivities of clones with autologous IgG antibodies, an average of 50 independent clones from each library and a total of 297 clones were isolated. DNA sequencing revealed that these 297 clones were derived from 136 different genes. Comparison of the 136 genes to sequences in DNA databases showed that 95 are previously identified genes and 41 are newly identified in this study. The antigens are derived from various genes including a chimeric gene between E-cadherin and an unknown gene Y, AKT oncogene, genes overexpressed in stomach cancers, genes of which the transcripts are alternatively or aberrantly spliced, and genes known to be involved in autoimmune diseases. Thus stomach cancer patients can generate an immune response against a surprisingly diverse set of gene products. To identify antigens potentially useful in the diagnosis and therapy of gastric cancer, all 136 genes were tested for their reactivities with a panel of sera from 44 gastric cancer patients (17 women and 27 men, aged 35-81 years) and with a panel of sera from 100 control individuals with no previous history of cancer but some of whom had gastritis (55 women and 45 men, aged 30-69 years). Eleven antigens showed reactivity only with a certain proportion of cancer patient sera but not with any control sera. An additional 12 antigens elicited antibody production at a much higher frequency in cancer patients than in control individuals. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of these antigens we are now examining their expression in normal and malignant tissues.","serex analysis of gastric cancer antigens stomach cancer is the major malignancy in japan and one of the most common cancers worldwide. to establish the basis for an immunotherapeutic approach to stomach cancer, we have initiated an analysis of stomach cancer antigens recognized by human immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies using se-rex, a powerful expression cloning method developed by dr. m. pfreundschuh's group. five stomach cancer cdna libraries have been screened with autologous patient sera: one moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; two poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas; and two scirrhous-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of borrmann type 4, the most devastating form of stomach cancer. based on the reactivities of clones with autologous igg antibodies, an average of 50 independent clones from each library and a total of 297 clones were isolated. dna sequencing revealed that these 297 clones were derived from 136 different genes. comparison of the 136 genes to sequences in dna databases showed",serex gastric antigens stomach major malignancy japan one common worldwide establish basis immunotherapeutic approach stomach initiate stomach antigens recognize human immunoglobulin g igg antibody use se rex powerful expression clone method develop dr pfreundschuh group five stomach cdna library screen autologous serum one moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma two poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma two scirrhous type poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma borrmann type devastating form stomach base reactivity clone autologous igg antibody average independent clone library total clone isolate dna sequence reveal clone derive different gene comparison gene sequence dna database show,d,Stomach Cancer
"Dietary preference, physical activity, and cancer risk in men: national health insurance corporation study The effects of vegetable preference and leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on cancer have been inconsistent. We examined the effects of dietary preference and physical activity, as well as their combined effect on cancer risk. This prospective cohort study included 444,963 men, older than 40 years, who participated in a national health examination program begun in 1996. Based on the answer to the question ""What kind of dietary preference do you have?"" we categorized dietary preference as (1) vegetables, (2) mixture of vegetables and meat, and (3) meats. We categorized LPA as low (< 4 times/wk, < 30 min/session), moderate (2–4 times/wk, ≥ 30 min/session or ≥ 5 times/wk, < 30 min/session), or high (≥ 5 times/wk, ≥ 30 min/session). We obtained cancer incidence data for 1996 through 2002 from the Korean Central Cancer Registry. We used a standard Poisson regression model with a log link function and person-time offset to estimate incidence and relative risk.. During the 6-year follow-up period, we identified 14,109 cancer cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preference for vegetables or a mixture of vegetables and meat as opposed to a preference for meat played a significant protective role against lung cancer incidence (aRR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68–0.98). Compared with the low LPA group, subjects with moderate-high LPA had a significantly lower risk for stomach (aRR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.86–0.98), lung (aRR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.75–0.92), and liver (aRR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81–0.95) cancer. Among current smokers, the combined moderate-high LPA and vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference group showed a 40% reduced risk of lung cancer (aRR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.47–0.76) compared with the combined low LPA and meat preference group. Among never/former smokers, subjects with moderate-high LPA and a preference for vegetables or a mixture of vegetables and meat showed reduced stomach cancer risk (aRR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.54–0.95). Our findings add to the evidence of the beneficial effects of vegetable preference on lung cancer risk and of physical activity on lung, stomach, and liver cancer risk.

"Occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions and risk of cancer in Swedish men and women. Objective: To investigate the risk of cancer among workers exposed to diesel emissions in a large record-linkage study from Sweden. Methods: The Swedish Cancer Environment Register III contains nationwide data on cancer incidence during 1971–1989, by occupation and industry of employment as reported in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. After excluding farmers, we classified job and industry titles according to estimated probability and intensity of exposure to diesel emissions. Exposed men in the 1960 census contributed over 7,400,000 person-years, and exposed women contributed over 240,000. We compared them to the remainder of the employed population, using indirect standardization and multivariate Poisson regression analysis. Results: Men exposed in the 1960 census experienced an increased risk of lung cancer: the relative risks (RRs) were 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.0), 1.1 (1.1–1.2) and 1.3 (1.3–1.4) for low, medium, and high intensity of exposure. Corresponding results for probability of exposure were 1.1 (1.0–1.1), 0.9 (0.86–0.94) and 1.2 (1.1–1.2). The risk was higher for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung than for other histological types. Results in women were not suggestive of an effect (RR in the category of medium or high intensity of exposure 1.1, 95% CI 0.6–1.8). A small but significant increase in risk of cancers of the stomach (SIR 1.06), pancreas (SIR 1.05), larynx (SIR 1.09), and the kidney (SIR 1.06) was present among men exposed to diesel emissions, without a clear trend according to either probability or intensity of exposure. The SIR among women was non-significantly increased for stomach, pancreatic, and laryngeal cancers, but not for kidney cancer. Furthermore, a significantly increased risk of oral/pharyngeal (SIR 1.64) and cervical (SIR 1.48) cancers was present among women, with a suggestion of a dose–response relationship. There was no increased risk of bladder cancer in either gender. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence of a positive exposure–response relationship between exposure to diesel emissions and lung cancer risk among men. The positive results for other neoplasms, such as stomach, pancreatic, oral/pharyngeal, and cervical cancers, cannot be attributed to diesel exposure, but they deserve attention in future investigations.","occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions and risk of cancer in swedish men and women. objective: to investigate the risk of cancer among workers exposed to diesel emissions in a large record-linkage study from sweden. methods: the swedish cancer environment register iii contains nationwide data on cancer incidence during 1971–1989, by occupation and industry of employment as reported in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. after excluding farmers, we classified job and industry titles according to estimated probability and intensity of exposure to diesel emissions. exposed men in the 1960 census contributed over 7,400,000 person-years, and exposed women contributed over 240,000. we compared them to the remainder of the employed population, using indirect standardization and multivariate poisson regression analysis. results: men exposed in the 1960 census experienced an increased risk of lung cancer: the relative risks (rrs) were 0.95 (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.9–1.0), 1.1 (1.1–1.2) and 1.3 (1.3–1.4) for low,",occupational exposure diesel engine emission risk swedish men woman investigate risk among worker expose diesel emission large record linkage sweden method swedish environment register iii contain nationwide data incidence occupation industry employment report census exclude farmer classify job industry accord estimate probability intensity exposure diesel emission expose men census contribute person year expose woman contribute compare remainder employed population use indirect standardization multivariate poisson regression result men expose census experience increase risk lung relative risk rrs confidence interval ci low,d,Stomach Cancer

Axial, sagittal, or coronal two-dimensional fast low-angle shot) MR images for the water-distended stomach were obtained with dynamic protocol, including precontrast images and images obtained 30, 60, 90, and 240–300 s after intravenous injection of the 0.1 mM Gd-DTPA/kg solution. We evaluated the thickness, interruption (or not) of the low signal intensity bands, and enhancement pattern of the cancerous wall and normal gastric wall. We prospectively evaluated the depth of cancer invasion, perigastric infiltration (extraserosal invasion), perigastric organ invasion, and regional lymph nodes and determined tumor staging on MR images. These MR evaluations including MR-determined staging were correlated with the surgicopathologic findings. ; Results: Stomach cancer was shown as having a thickened wall with a rapid enhancing pattern after intravenous Gd-DTPA administration. The mucosa (and/or submucosa) affected by stomach cancer showed an early enhancement pattern (30–90 s after Gd-DTPA administration) in 43 of 46 patients (93%). The normal gastric mucosa demonstrated a delayed peak enhancement pattern (>90 s after Gd-DTPA administration) in 29 of 46 patients (63%) and variable enhancement pattern in 17 of 46 patients (37%). An interrupted low signal intensity band or highly enhanced tumorous lesion penetrating through the gastric wall was seen in 17 of 19 pT3 patients (90%). Consistency between MR-determined staging and surgicopathologic staging occurred in three of four pT1 tumors (75%), 10 of 13 pT2 tumors (77%), 17 of 19 pT3 tumors (90%), and eight of 10 pT4 tumors (80%); overall accuracy was 83%. Overall accuracy of regional lymph node involvement, as determined by enhanced MR, was 52%; 24 of 46 node groups were positive. ; Conclusions: Dynamic and delayed MR imaging can be useful for predicting depth of cancer invasion, perigastric infiltration (extraserosal invasion), and perigastric organ invasion by gastric cancer.","value of the dynamic and delayed mr sequence with gd-dtpa in the t- staging of stomach cancer: correlation with the histopathology background: to evaluate the usefulness of dynamic and delayed magnetic resonance (mr) imaging in the t-staging of stomach cancer and to compare the enhancement pattern of the cancerous lesion and the normal wall. ; methods: we performed mr imaging in 46 patients with stomach cancer (including four early gastric cancers and 42 advanced gastric cancers). axial, sagittal, or coronal two-dimensional fast low-angle shot) mr images for the water-distended stomach were obtained with dynamic protocol, including precontrast images and images obtained 30, 60, 90, and 240–300 s after intravenous injection of the 0.1 mm gd-dtpa/kg solution. we evaluated the thickness, interruption (or not) of the low signal intensity bands, and enhancement pattern of the cancerous wall and normal gastric wall. we prospectively evaluated the depth of cancer invasion, perigastric infiltration",value dynamic delayed mr sequence gd dtpa staging stomach correlation histopathology evaluate usefulness dynamic delayed magnetic resonance mr imaging staging stomach compare enhancement pattern cancerous lesion normal wall method perform mr imaging stomach include four early gastric advance gastric axial sagittal coronal two dimensional fast low angle shot mr image water distend stomach obtain dynamic protocol include precontrast image image obtain intravenous injection mm gd dtpa kg solution evaluate thickness interruption low signal intensity band enhancement pattern cancerous wall normal gastric wall prospectively evaluate depth invasion perigastric infiltration,d,Stomach Cancer
"A rare case of PSA-negative metastasized prostate cancer to the stomach with serum CEA and CA19-9 elevation: a case report Metastatic cancer to the stomach is relatively rare. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a reliable biomarker used in the screening and management of patients with prostate cancer. However, it is difficult to definitively diagnose a PSA-negative metastatic gastric tumor of prostate cancer because the cancer sometimes resembles primary gastric cancer in clinical images. It is also difficult to distinguish metastatic cancer from primary cancer even in the pathological examination of biopsy samples when the lesion is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. There is a possibility that the characteristics of the cancer are changed during treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Therefore, careful consideration is required for surgical indication. A 60-year-old male underwent radical prostatectomy and subsequent radiation therapy for advanced prostate cancer (pT3N1M0) 10 years previously, and hormone therapy was started for metachronous multiple bone metastasis 10 months before. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an irregular depressed lesion with a convergence of folds at the greater curvature of the upper gastric body. Biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that was negative for PSA upon immunohistochemistry. He had high serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (946.1 ng/ml) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (465.1 U/ml) levels with no elevation of PSA (0.152 ng/ml). The tumor was diagnosed as primary gastric cancer based on the clinical imaging and pathological examination of the biopsy sample including the PSA staining. Based on the diagnosis, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. However, pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that was positive for other prostate markers such as androgen receptor. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with metastasized prostate cancer to the stomach. We report a case of metastatic gastric cancer of prostate cancer 10 years after radical prostatectomy. In the present case, it was difficult to diagnose a metastatic gastric tumor of prostate cancer preoperatively, because of its resemblance to primary gastric cancer without PSA expression and no serum PSA elevation. Although a rare case entity, it is important to consider the possibility of a metastatic gastric tumor when the surgical indication is determined in cases with another co-existing cancer.","a rare case of psa-negative metastasized prostate cancer to the stomach with serum cea and ca19-9 elevation: a case report metastatic cancer to the stomach is relatively rare. prostate-specific antigen (psa) is a reliable biomarker used in the screening and management of patients with prostate cancer. however, it is difficult to definitively diagnose a psa-negative metastatic gastric tumor of prostate cancer because the cancer sometimes resembles primary gastric cancer in clinical images. it is also difficult to distinguish metastatic cancer from primary cancer even in the pathological examination of biopsy samples when the lesion is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. there is a possibility that the characteristics of the cancer are changed during treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. therefore, careful consideration is required for surgical indication. a 60-year-old male underwent radical prostatectomy and subsequent radiation therapy for advanced prostate cancer (pt3n1m0) 10 years previously, and hormone therapy was started for",rare psa negative metastasized prostate stomach serum cea ca elevation report metastatic stomach relatively rare prostate specific antigen psa reliable biomarker use screening management prostate however difficult definitively diagnose psa negative metastatic gastric prostate sometimes resemble primary gastric image also difficult distinguish metastatic primary even pathological examination biopsy sample lesion poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma possibility characteristic change chemotherapy radiation therapy therefore careful consideration require surgical indication year old male underwent radical prostatectomy subsequent radiation therapy advanced prostate pt n year previously hormone therapy start,d,Stomach Cancer
"Whole stomach versus narrow gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer (ATHLETE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">There are two types of methods of creating a gastric conduit after esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer: narrow gastric tube reconstruction or whole stomach reconstruction. Whole stomach reconstruction with good blood perfusion was reported in a prospective cohort study to be safe and that it has the possibility to prevent anastomotic leakage (AL). We therefore planned a randomized controlled phase III study to investigate the superiority of whole stomach reconstruction over narrow gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This is a single center, two-arm, open-label, randomized phase III trial. We calculated that 65 patients in each arm of this study and total study population of 130 patients are required according to our historical data on narrow gastric tube reconstruction and prospective data on whole stomach reconstruction. In the narrow gastric tube group, a 3.5-cm-wide gastric tube is made along the greater curvature of the stomach using linear staplers.

"Cancer incidence among marine engineers, a population-based study (Iceland). Objectives: Marine engineers are in their occupation exposed to different chemicals, organic solvents, exhaust gases, oils, and petroleum products, and were formerly exposed to asbestos. The aim was to study the cancer pattern, with particular attention to lung and bladder cancer, in an Icelandic cohort of marine engineers, indirectly controlling for their smoking habits. Methods: A cohort of 6603 male marine engineers was followed up from 1955 to 1998, a total of 167,715 person-years. The cohort was record linked by the engineers' personal identification numbers to population-based registers containing the vital and emigration status and cancer diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for all cancers and different cancer sites in relation to different lag time and year of graduation. Information on smoking habits was obtained by administering a questionnaire to a sample of the cohort (n = 1501). Results: In the total cohort 810 cancers were observed, whereas 794 were expected (SIR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0–1.1), and significantly increased risk of stomach cancer (SIR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.5) and lung cancer (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.5) was found. Increased risk of all cancers (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.3), stomach cancer (SIR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–1.9), lung cancer (SIR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.8), pleural mesothelioma (SIR 4.8, 95% CI 1.3–12.3), and urinary bladder cancer (SIR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.8) were observed when a 40-year lag time was applied. The engineers' smoking habits were similar to those in a sample of the general population. The predictive value for lung cancer was 1.03. Conclusions: The increased risk for mesothelioma is possibly attributable to the previous asbestos exposure. The excess of lung cancer could also be related to asbestos exposure. The high incidence of stomach cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer may be related to exposure to chemical risk factors, such as oils and petroleum products, as confounding due to smoking seems to be ruled out. In the light of the limited exposure information in the present study the importance of the different occupational exposures needs to be evaluated in further studies.","cancer incidence among marine engineers, a population-based study (iceland). objectives: marine engineers are in their occupation exposed to different chemicals, organic solvents, exhaust gases, oils, and petroleum products, and were formerly exposed to asbestos. the aim was to study the cancer pattern, with particular attention to lung and bladder cancer, in an icelandic cohort of marine engineers, indirectly controlling for their smoking habits. methods: a cohort of 6603 male marine engineers was followed up from 1955 to 1998, a total of 167,715 person-years. the cohort was record linked by the engineers' personal identification numbers to population-based registers containing the vital and emigration status and cancer diagnosis. standardized incidence ratios (sirs) were calculated for all cancers and different cancer sites in relation to different lag time and year of graduation. information on smoking habits was obtained by administering a questionnaire to a sample of the cohort (n = 1501). results: in",incidence among marine engineer population base iceland marine engineer occupation expose different chemical organic solvent exhaust gas oil petroleum product formerly expose asbestos pattern particular attention lung bladder icelandic cohort marine engineer indirectly control smoking habit cohort male marine engineer follow total person year cohort record link engineer personal identification number population base register contain vital emigration status diagnosis standardize incidence ratio sir calculate different site relation different lag time year graduation information smoke habit obtain administer questionnaire sample cohort n result,d,Stomach Cancer

"An age-period-cohort analysis of mortality rates for stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer among prefectures in Japan, 1999–2018 Although change in the birth cohort effect on cancer mortality rates is known to be highly associated with the decreasing rates of age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Japan, the differences in the trends of cohort effect for representative cancer types among the prefectures remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the decreasing rate of cohort effects among the prefectures for representative cancer types using age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Data on stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer mortality for each prefecture and the population data from 1999 to 2018 were obtained from the Vital Statistics in Japan. Mortality data for individuals aged 50 to 79 years grouped in 5-year increments were used, and corresponding birth cohorts born 1920–1924 through 1964–1978 were used for analysis. We estimated the effects of age, period, and cohort on each type of mortality rate for each prefecture by sex. Then, we calculated the decreasing rates of cohort effects for each prefecture. We also calculated the mortality rate ratio of each prefecture compared with all of Japan for cohorts using the estimates. As a result of APC analysis, we found that the decreasing rates of period effects were small and that there was a little difference in the decreasing rates among prefectures for all types of cancer among both sexes. On the other hand, there was a large difference in the decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer mortality rates among prefectures, particularly for men. For men, the decreasing rates of cohort effects in cohorts born between 1920–1924 and 1964–1978 varied among prefectures, ranging from 4.1 to 84.0% for stomach cancer and from 20.2 to 92.4% for liver cancers, respectively. On the other hand, the differences in the decreasing rates of cohort effects among prefectures for colorectal and lung cancer were relatively smaller. The decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer varied widely among prefectures.

"Different regression equations relate age to the incidence of Lauren types 1 and 2 stomach cancer in the SEER database: these equations are unaffected by sex or race Although impacts upon gastric cancer incidence of race, age, sex, and Lauren type have been individually explored, neither their importance when evaluated together nor the presence or absence of interactions among them have not been fully described. This study, derived from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute) data, analyzed the incidences of gastric cancer between the years 1992–2001.

(160 groups = 2 five year periods × 2 race groups × 2 sexes × 2 Lauren types × 10 age groups.) Linear regression was used to analyze the importance of each of these explanatory variables and to see if there were interactions among the explanatory variables. Race, sex, age group, and Lauren type were found to be important explanatory variables, as were interactions between Lauren type and each of the other important explanatory variables. In the final model, the contribution of each explanatory variable was highly statistically significant (t > 5, d.f. 151, P < 0.00001). The regression equation for Lauren type 1 had different coefficients for the explanatory variables Race, Sex, and Age, than did the regression equation for Lauren type 2. The change of the incidence of stomach cancer with respect to age for Lauren type 1 stomach cancer differs from that for Lauren type 2 stomach cancers. The relationships between age and Lauren type do not differ across gender or race. The results support the notion that Lauren type 1 and Lauren type 2 gastric cancers have different etiologies and different patterns of progression from pre-cancer to cancer.

"Gene expression analysis of a Helicobacter pylori-infected and high-salt diet-treated mouse gastric tumor model: identification of CD177 as a novel prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and excessive salt intake are known as important risk factors for stomach cancer in humans. However, interactions of these two factors with gene expression profiles during gastric carcinogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the global gene expression associated with stomach carcinogenesis and prognosis of human gastric cancer using a mouse model. To find candidate genes involved in stomach carcinogenesis, we firstly constructed a carcinogen-induced mouse gastric tumor model combined with H. pylori infection and high-salt diet. C57BL/6J mice were given N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in their drinking water and sacrificed after 40 weeks. Animals of a combination group were inoculated with H. pylori and fed a high-salt diet. Gene expression profiles in glandular stomach of the mice were investigated by oligonucleotide microarray. Second, we examined an availability of the candidate gene as prognostic factor for human patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD177, one of the up-regulated genes, was performed in human advanced gastric cancer specimens to evaluate the association with prognosis. The multiplicity of gastric tumor in carcinogen-treated mice was significantly increased by combination of H. pylori infection and high-salt diet. In the microarray analysis, 35 and 31 more than two-fold up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively, were detected in the H. pylori-infection and high-salt diet combined group compared with the other groups. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed significant over-expression of two candidate genes including Cd177 and Reg3g. On immunohistochemical analysis of CD177 in human advanced gastric cancer specimens, over-expression was evident in 33 (60.0%) of 55 cases, significantly correlating with a favorable prognosis (P = 0.0294). Multivariate analysis including clinicopathological factors as covariates revealed high expression of CD177 to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. These results suggest that our mouse model combined with H. pylori infection and high-salt diet is useful for gene expression profiling in gastric carcinogenesis, providing evidence that CD177 is a novel prognostic factor for stomach cancer.

"A case of Turcot's syndrome type 1 with loss of immunoexpression of MSH6 in colon cancer and liver metastasis due to secondary somatic mutation in coding mononucleotide (C)8 tract: a case report. Lynch syndrome (LS), which is known as a hereditary cancer syndrome, is distinguished by microsatellite instability, represented by the altered number of repetitive sequences in the coding and/or non-coding region. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (e.g., MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) has been recognized as an useful technique for screening of LS. Previous study has shown that the assessment of IHC, however, requires specific caution due to variable staining patterns even without germline mutations in MMR genes. A 48-year-old man, who had been treated for anaplastic astrocytoma, was referred to our department for the precise examination of progressing anemia. Whole-body examination revealed two advanced carcinomas in descending colon and stomach. A hypo-vascular mass lesion was detected in liver as well. Pathological diagnosis (on surgical specimens) was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in descending colon, moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in stomach, and liver metastasis, which is possibly from colon. It was suspected that this case would be Turcot’s syndrome-type-1 due to its specific family history having two cases of colon cancer within the second relatives. Pathogenic frameshift mutations in codon 618 of MLH1 gene was identified. Immunohistochemical analyses (IHC) demonstrated complete loss of MLH1 immuno-expression as well as of PMS2 except for those in brain tumor. Although frameshift mutation was not found in MSH6 gene, histological expression of MSH6 was patchy in primary colon carcinoma and was completely lost in the metastatic site in liver. MSH6 expression in gastric carcinoma, a coincidental cancer in this case, was intact. An abnormal (C)8 region was identified by the cloned PCR of colon and liver tumors but not from gastric cancer.

"Stage of cancer diagnoses among migrants from the former Soviet Union in comparison to the German population – are diagnoses among migrants delayed? In this study, we compared stage at diagnosis, standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of most frequent cancer diagnoses between re-settlers (Aussiedler) from the former Soviet Union and the general population in the Saarland in Germany to assess possible delays in diagnosis of cancer among this migrant group. Lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin and stomach cancer diagnoses among a cohort of 18,619 re-settlers living in the Saarland between 1990 and 2009 were identified by the federal state’s cancer registry. Vital status was available for the respective time-period and used to calculate SIR and SMR in comparison to the autochthonous population. Tumor stages were condensed into local and advanced stages. Odds ratios (OR) for an advanced tumor stage were modeled in dependence of re-settler-status and relevant covariates by logistic regression. Missing values were addressed in a sensitivity analysis. The influence of duration of stay in Germany on advanced stage diagnosis was analyzed among re-settlers. SIR and SMR of lung and breast cancer were lower among female re-settlers, while SIR and SMR of colorectal and prostate cancer were lower among male re-settlers. SIR and SMR of stomach cancer were elevated among both sexes. Female re-settlers showed an elevated OR for being diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer. Both male and female re-settlers showed an elevated OR when observing all six sites combined (OR among males 1.47, p = 0.04; OR among females 1.37, p = 0.05). The result of elevated ORs was supported in the sensitivity analysis. Finally, male re-settlers showed a weak association between duration of stay in Germany and reduced risk for advanced stage diagnosis. Re-settlers were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage. These findings are in line with previous research having shown unfavorable health care utilization of re-settlers. Overall, low mortality rates despite an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis argue for a sufficient follow-up care, comparable to the autochthonous population.","stage of cancer diagnoses among migrants from the former soviet union in comparison to the german population – are diagnoses among migrants delayed? in this study, we compared stage at diagnosis, standardized incidence ratio (sir) and standardized mortality ratio (smr) of most frequent cancer diagnoses between re-settlers (aussiedler) from the former soviet union and the general population in the saarland in germany to assess possible delays in diagnosis of cancer among this migrant group. lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin and stomach cancer diagnoses among a cohort of 18,619 re-settlers living in the saarland between 1990 and 2009 were identified by the federal state’s cancer registry. vital status was available for the respective time-period and used to calculate sir and smr in comparison to the autochthonous population. tumor stages were condensed into local and advanced stages. odds ratios (or) for an advanced tumor",stage diagnosis among migrant former soviet union comparison german population diagnose among migrant delay compare stage diagnosis standardize incidence ratio sir standardized mortality ratio smr frequent diagnosis settler aussiedler former soviet union general population saarland germany assess possible delay diagnosis among migrant group lung colorectal breast prostate malignant melanoma skin stomach diagnose among cohort settler live saarland identify federal state registry vital status available respective time period use calculate sir smr comparison autochthonous population stage condense local advanced stage odds ratio advanced,d,Stomach Cancer
"Amputation neuroma mimicking lymph node metastasis of remnant gastric cancer: a case report. Amputation neuromas (ANs) are reactive hyperplasia of nerve tissues that occur after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves. Only two previous reports of ANs occurring around the stomach and post gastrectomy have been reported. We report the case of a patient with AN near the remnant stomach who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. A 76-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy, D1+ lymphadenectomy, and Billroth-I reconstruction for early gastric cancer in another hospital at 63 years of age. A regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow-up examination after gastrectomy revealed an ulcerative lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach, which was diagnosed as remnant gastric cancer based on the histopathological examination. Then, he was transferred to our hospital. An upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopy revealed an 18-mm Type 0-IIc lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach with an estimated depth within the mucosa (T1a). An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) failed to detect the primary lesion; however, a slightly enhanced 13 × 10-mm nodule was detected near the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach. An endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the nodule showed no cancer cell; thus, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the remnant gastric cancer was performed. Histopathological examination revealed noncurative resection due to T1b2 and UL (+). We planned an additional surgical resection. Before the resection, CT was performed, which had a 3-month interval with a previous CT, showing an enlargement of the nodule to 16 × 12 mm. We diagnosed the nodule as a lymph node metastasis and performed resection of the remnant stomach, D2 lymphadenectomy, splenectomy, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The nodule was later diagnosed as AN based on the histopathological examination. There was no residual cancer in the resected specimen. We report AN mimicking lymph node metastasis near the remnant stomach of a patient with remnant gastric cancer. When nodules appear in the previous operative field, the possibility of ANs should be considered, although the incidence may be quite low.","amputation neuroma mimicking lymph node metastasis of remnant gastric cancer: a case report. amputation neuromas (ans) are reactive hyperplasia of nerve tissues that occur after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves. only two previous reports of ans occurring around the stomach and post gastrectomy have been reported. we report the case of a patient with an near the remnant stomach who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. a 76-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy, d1+ lymphadenectomy, and billroth-i reconstruction for early gastric cancer in another hospital at 63 years of age. a regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow-up examination after gastrectomy revealed an ulcerative lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach, which was diagnosed as remnant gastric cancer based on the histopathological examination. then, he was transferred to our hospital. an upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopy revealed an 18-mm type 0-iic lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant",amputation neuroma mimic lymph node metastasis remnant gastric report amputation neuroma reactive hyperplasia nerve tissue occur trauma surgery involve peripheral nerve two previous report occur around stomach post gastrectomy report report near remnant stomach underwent distal gastrectomy gastric year old man underwent distal gastrectomy lymphadenectomy billroth reconstruction early gastric another hospital year age regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow examination gastrectomy reveal ulcerative lesion less curvature remnant stomach diagnose remnant gastric base histopathological examination transfer hospital upper gastrointestinal series endoscopy reveal mm type iic lesion less curvature remnant,d,Stomach Cancer
"Stomach microbiota, Helicobacter pylori, and group 2 innate lymphoid cells. The stomach has been thought to host few commensal bacteria because of the existence of barriers, such as gastric acid. However, recent culture-independent, sequencing-based microbial analysis has shown that the stomach also harbors a wide diversity of microbiota. Although the stomach immune system, especially innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), has not been well elucidated, recent studies have shown that group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) are the dominant subtype in the stomach of both humans and mice. Stomach ILC2s are unique in that their existence is dependent on stomach microbiota, in sharp contrast to the lack of an impact of commensal microbiota on ILC2s in other tissues. The microbiota dependency of stomach ILC2s is partly explained by their responsiveness to interleukin (IL)-7. Stomach ILC2s express significantly higher IL-7 receptor protein levels on their surface and proliferate more in response to IL-7 stimulation in vitro than small intestinal ILC2s. Consistently, the stomach expresses much higher IL-7 protein levels than the small intestine. IL-5 secreted from stomach ILC2s promotes immunoglobulin (Ig) A production by plasma B cells. In a murine model, stomach ILC2s are important in containing Helicobacter pylori infection, especially in the early phase of infection, by promoting IgA production. The stomach’s microbiota, and its effect on immune development, may be key factors in fending off infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium found in the stomach that can lead to gastric upset and, if left untreated, ulcers or stomach cancer. Unlike the intestines, the stomach was thought to contain few bacteria owing to its high acidity, but according to new studies, the stomach harbors its own set of microbiota. Hiroshi Ohno and Naoko Satoh-Takayama at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences and Yokohama City University, Japan, review how gastric microbiota affects development of immune cells in the stomach. They report that the stomach’s unique microbiota influences maturation of particular immune cells, which may be crucial in fighting off H. pylori infection. These findings illuminate a new area in microbiome research.","stomach microbiota, helicobacter pylori, and group 2 innate lymphoid cells. the stomach has been thought to host few commensal bacteria because of the existence of barriers, such as gastric acid. however, recent culture-independent, sequencing-based microbial analysis has shown that the stomach also harbors a wide diversity of microbiota. although the stomach immune system, especially innate lymphoid cells (ilcs), has not been well elucidated, recent studies have shown that group 2 ilcs (ilc2s) are the dominant subtype in the stomach of both humans and mice. stomach ilc2s are unique in that their existence is dependent on stomach microbiota, in sharp contrast to the lack of an impact of commensal microbiota on ilc2s in other tissues. the microbiota dependency of stomach ilc2s is partly explained by their responsiveness to interleukin (il)-7. stomach ilc2s express significantly higher il-7 receptor protein levels on their surface and proliferate more in response to il-7 stimulation in",stomach microbiota helicobacter pylorus group innate lymphoid cell stomach think host commensal bacteria existence barrier gastric acid however recent culture independent sequencing base microbial show stomach also harbor wide diversity microbiota although stomach immune system especially innate lymphoid cell ilcs well elucidated recent show group ilcs ilc dominant subtype stomach human mouse stomach ilc unique existence dependent stomach microbiota sharp contrast lack impact commensal microbiota ilc tissue microbiota dependency stomach ilc partly explain responsiveness interleukin il stomach ilc express significantly high il receptor protein level surface proliferate response il stimulation,d,Stomach Cancer
"Medical expenses of urban Chinese patients with stomach cancer during 2002–2011: a hospital-based multicenter retrospective study In China, stomach cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. Few studies have examined Chinese stomach cancer patients’ medical expenses and their associated trends. The Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) is a Major Public Health Project funded by the central government. Through this project, we have extracted patients’ medical expenses from hospital billing data to examine the costs of the first course treatments (which refers to 2 months before and 10 months after the date of cancer diagnosis) in Chinese patients with stomach cancer and the associated trends. The expense data of 14,692 urban Chinese patients with stomach cancer were collected from 40 hospitals in 13 provinces. We estimated the inflation-adjusted medical expenses per patient during 2002–2011. We described the time trends of medical expenses at the country-level, and those trends by subgroup, and analyzed the compositions of medical expenses. We constructed the Generalized Linear Mixed (GLM) regression model with Poisson distribution to examine the factors that were associated with medical expenses per patient. The average medical expenses of the first course treatments were about 43,249 CNY (6851 USD) in 2011, more than twice of that in 2002. The expenses increased by an average annual rate of 7.4%. Longer stay during hospitalization and an increased number of episodes of care are the two main contributors to the expense increase. The upward trend of medical expenses was observed in almost all patient subgroups. Drug expenses accounted for over half of the medical expenses. The average medical expenses of the first course (2 months before and 10 months after the date of cancer diagnosis) treatments per stomach cancer patient in urban China in 2011 were doubled during the previous 10 years, and about twice as high as the per capita disposable income of urban households in the same year. Such high expenses indicate that it makes economic sense to invest in cancer prevention and control in China.","medical expenses of urban chinese patients with stomach cancer during 2002–2011: a hospital-based multicenter retrospective study in china, stomach cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. few studies have examined chinese stomach cancer patients’ medical expenses and their associated trends. the cancer screening program in urban china (canspuc) is a major public health project funded by the central government. through this project, we have extracted patients’ medical expenses from hospital billing data to examine the costs of the first course treatments (which refers to 2 months before and 10 months after the date of cancer diagnosis) in chinese patients with stomach cancer and the associated trends. the expense data of 14,692 urban chinese patients with stomach cancer were collected from 40 hospitals in 13 provinces. we estimated the inflation-adjusted medical expenses per patient during 2002–2011. we described the time trends of medical",medical expense urban chinese stomach hospital base multicenter retrospective china stomach third common third leading cause death examine chinese stomach medical expense associate trend screen program urban china canspuc major public health project fund central government project extract medical expense hospital billing data examine cost first course refers month month date diagnosis chinese stomach associated trend expense data urban chinese stomach collect hospital province estimate inflation adjust medical expense per describe time trend medical,d,Stomach Cancer
"Identification of valid reference genes for gene expression studies of human stomach cancer by reverse transcription-qPCR Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression. Target gene expression levels are usually normalized to a consistently expressed reference gene also known as internal standard, in the same sample. However, much effort has not been expended thus far in the search for reference genes suitable for the study of stomach cancer using RT-qPCR, although selection of optimal reference genes is critical for interpretation of results. We assessed the suitability of six possible reference genes, beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal subunit L29 (RPL29) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) in 20 normal and tumor stomach tissue pairs of stomach cancer patients and 6 stomach cancer cell lines, by RT-qPCR. Employing expression stability analyses using NormFinder and geNorm algorithms we determined the order of performance of these reference genes and their variation values. This RT-qPCR study showed that there are statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in the expression levels of HPRT1 and 18S rRNA in 'normal-' versus 'tumor stomach tissues'. The stability analyses by geNorm suggest B2M-GAPDH, as best reference gene combination for 'stomach cancer cell lines'; RPL29-HPRT1, for 'all stomach tissues'; and ACTB-18S rRNA, for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. NormFinder also identified B2M as the best reference gene for 'stomach cancer cell lines', RPL29-B2M for 'all stomach tissues', and 18S rRNA-ACTB for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. The comparisons of normalized expression of the target gene, GPNMB, showed different interpretation of target gene expression depend on best single reference gene or combination. This study validated RPL29 and RPL29-B2M as the best single reference genes and combination, for RT-qPCR analysis of 'all stomach tissues', and B2M and B2M-GAPDH as the best single reference gene and combination, for 'stomach cancer cell lines'. Use of these validated reference genes should provide more exact interpretation of differential gene expressions at transcription level in stomach cancer.","identification of valid reference genes for gene expression studies of human stomach cancer by reverse transcription-qpcr reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) is a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression. target gene expression levels are usually normalized to a consistently expressed reference gene also known as internal standard, in the same sample. however, much effort has not been expended thus far in the search for reference genes suitable for the study of stomach cancer using rt-qpcr, although selection of optimal reference genes is critical for interpretation of results. we assessed the suitability of six possible reference genes, beta-actin (actb), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (hprt1), beta-2-microglobulin (b2m), ribosomal subunit l29 (rpl29) and 18s ribosomal rna (18s rrna) in 20 normal and tumor stomach tissue pairs of stomach cancer patients and 6 stomach cancer cell lines, by rt-qpcr. employing expression stability analyses using normfinder and",identification valid reference gene gene expression human stomach reverse transcription qpcr reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr powerful method gene expression target gene expression level usually normalize consistently express reference gene also know internal standard sample however much effort expend thus far search reference gene suitable stomach use rt qpcr although selection optimal reference gene critical interpretation result assess suitability six possible reference gene beta actin actb glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase hprt beta microglobulin b ribosomal subunit l rpl ribosomal rna rrna normal stomach tissue pair stomach stomach cell line rt qpcr employ expression stability analyse use normfinder,d,Stomach Cancer
"Comprehensive analysis of inhibin-β A as a potential biomarker for gastrointestinal tract cancers through bioinformatics approaches. Inhibin, β, which is also known as INHBA, encodes a protein that belongs to the Transforming Growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cancer. Gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) cancer refers to the cancers that develop in the colon, liver, esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, and bile ducts of the digestive system. The role of INHBA in all GI tract cancers remains understudied. By utilizing GEPIA2, which uses transcriptomic data from TCGA, we examined the expression of INHBA across different GI tract cancers. The results revealed consistent upregulation of INHBA in all TCGA GI tract cancers, except for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it showed downregulation compared to normal tissues, along with GTEx normal samples. Significant differences in INHBA expression were noted in adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, rectum, and stomach, while no such differences were observed in cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer. Moreover, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis has been done to demonstrate that the differences in expression levels are significantly related to pathological tumor stages and prognosis in different GI tract cancers. Mucinous adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma show a higher frequency of INHBA alteration and are primarily linked to mutations and amplifications. DNA methylation, immune infiltration, functional enrichment analysis, the genes associated with INHBA, and survival analysis in all TCGA GI tract cancers have been extensively analyzed. In colon and stomach cancers, increased INHBA expression significantly correlates with poorer overall survival (OS). However, in colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, higher expression is significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, INHBA expression exhibited a positive correlation with cancer-associated fibroblasts across all gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that INHBA and its interacting proteins are involved in several pathways, including TGF-beta signaling, Signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling, and so on as major pathways. These findings demonstrate that INHBA could serve as a potential biomarker therapeutic target for GI tract cancer.","comprehensive analysis of inhibin-β a as a potential biomarker for gastrointestinal tract cancers through bioinformatics approaches. inhibin, β, which is also known as inhba, encodes a protein that belongs to the transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cancer. gastrointestinal tract (gi tract) cancer refers to the cancers that develop in the colon, liver, esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, and bile ducts of the digestive system. the role of inhba in all gi tract cancers remains understudied. by utilizing gepia2, which uses transcriptomic data from tcga, we examined the expression of inhba across different gi tract cancers. the results revealed consistent upregulation of inhba in all tcga gi tract cancers, except for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it showed downregulation compared to normal tissues, along with gtex normal samples. significant differences in inhba expression were noted in adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, rectum, and stomach, while no such",comprehensive inhibin potential biomarker gastrointestinal tract bioinformatics approach inhibin also know inhba encode protein belong transform growth factor tgf superfamily play pivotal role gastrointestinal tract gi tract refers develop colon liver esophagus stomach rectum pancreas bile duct digestive system role inhba gi tract remain understudied utilize gepia use transcriptomic data tcga examine expression inhba across different gi tract cancers result reveal consistent upregulation inhba tcga gi tract except liver hepatocellular carcinoma show downregulation compare normal tissue along gtex normal sample significant difference inhba expression note adenocarcinoma colon pancreas rectum stomach,d,Stomach Cancer
"Splicing-dependent expression of microRNAs of mirtron origin in human digestive and excretory system cancer cells An abundant class of intronic microRNAs (miRNAs) undergoes atypical Drosha-independent biogenesis in which the spliceosome governs the excision of hairpin miRNA precursors, called mirtrons. Although nearly 500 splicing-dependent miRNA candidates have been recently predicted via bioinformatic analysis of human RNA-Seq datasets, only a few of them have been experimentally validated. The detailed mechanism of miRNA processing by the splicing machinery and the roles of mirtronic miRNAs in cancer are yet to be uncovered. We experimentally examined whether biogenesis of certain miRNAs is under a splicing control by analyzing their expression levels in response to alterations in the 5′- and 3′-splice sites of a series of intron-containing minigenes carrying appropriate miRNAs. The expression levels of the miRNAs processed from mirtrons were determined by quantitative real-time PCR in five digestive tract (pancreas PANC-1, SU.86.86, T3M4, stomach KATOIII, colon HCT116) and two excretory system (kidney CaKi-1, 786-O) carcinoma cell lines as well as in pancreatic, stomach, and colorectal tumors. Transiently expressed SRSF1 and SRSF2 splicing factors were quantified by western blotting in the nuclear fractions of HCT116 cells. We found that biogenesis of the human hsa-miR-1227-3p, hsa-miR-1229-3p, and hsa-miR-1236-3p is splicing-dependent; therefore, these miRNAs can be assigned to the class of miRNAs processed by a non-canonical mirtron pathway. The expression analysis revealed a differential regulation of human mirtronic miRNAs in various cancer cell lines and tumors. In particular, hsa-miR-1229-3p is selectively upregulated in the pancreatic and stomach cancer cell lines derived from metastatic sites. Compared with the healthy controls, the expression of hsa-miR-1226-3p was significantly higher in stomach tumors but extensively downregulated in colorectal tumors. Furthermore, we provided evidence that overexpression of SRSF1 or SRSF2 can upregulate the processing of individual mirtronic miRNAs in HCT116 cells. An interplay of different splicing factors, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, may alter the levels of miRNAs of mirtron origin in a cell. Our findings underline the specific expression profiles of mirtronic miRNAs in colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic cancer.","splicing-dependent expression of micrornas of mirtron origin in human digestive and excretory system cancer cells an abundant class of intronic micrornas (mirnas) undergoes atypical drosha-independent biogenesis in which the spliceosome governs the excision of hairpin mirna precursors, called mirtrons. although nearly 500 splicing-dependent mirna candidates have been recently predicted via bioinformatic analysis of human rna-seq datasets, only a few of them have been experimentally validated. the detailed mechanism of mirna processing by the splicing machinery and the roles of mirtronic mirnas in cancer are yet to be uncovered. we experimentally examined whether biogenesis of certain mirnas is under a splicing control by analyzing their expression levels in response to alterations in the 5′- and 3′-splice sites of a series of intron-containing minigenes carrying appropriate mirnas. the expression levels of the mirnas processed from mirtrons were determined by quantitative real-time pcr in five digestive tract (pancreas panc-1, su.86.86, t3m4, stomach katoiii,",splice dependent expression micrornas mirtron origin human digestive excretory system cell abundant class intronic micrornas mirnas undergoes atypical drosha independent biogenesis spliceosome govern excision hairpin mirna precursor call mirtrons although nearly splice dependent mirna candidate recently predict via bioinformatic human rna seq datasets experimentally validate detailed mechanism mirna processing splicing machinery role mirtronic mirnas yet uncover experimentally examine whether biogenesis certain mirnas splice control analyze expression level response alteration splice site series intron contain minigenes carry appropriate mirnas expression level mirnas process mirtrons determine quantitative real time pcr five digestive tract pancreas panc su stomach katoiii,d,Stomach Cancer
"Relationships between cancer pattern, country income and geographical region in Asia Background: Cancer incidence and mortality varies across region, sex and country’s economic status. While most studies focused on global trends, this study aimed to describe and analyse cancer incidence and mortality in Asia, focusing on cancer site, sex, region and income status. Methods: Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates of cancer were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. Cancer mortality to incidence ratios (MIRs) were calculated to represent cancer survival. The data were analysed based on the four regions in Asia and income. Results: Cancer incidence rate is lower in Asia compared to the West but for MIR, it is the reverse. In Asia, the most common cancers in men are lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and oesophageal cancers while the most common cancers in women are breast, lung, cervical, colorectal and stomach cancers. The MIRs are the highest in lung, liver and stomach cancers and the lowest in colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. Eastern and Western Asia have a higher incidence of cancer compared to South-Eastern and South-Central Asia but this pattern is the reverse for MIR. Cancer incidence rate increases with country income particularly in colorectal and breast cancers but the pattern is the opposite for MIR. Conclusion: This study confirms that there is a wide variation in cancer incidence and mortality across Asia. This study is the first step towards documenting and explaining the changing cancer pattern in Asia in comparison to the rest of the world. Background Recent studies have found that developing countries, particularly those in Asia, are facing a rising cancer incidence. The incidence rates of cancers such as lung and colorectal in some Asian countries have surpassed that of Western countries [1, 2]. This change may be due to the adoption of cancer-related lifestyle such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, obesity and high-fat, low-fibre diet [3]; environmental and occupational risk factors such as air pollution, indoor smoke from household use of solid fuel; and contaminated","relationships between cancer pattern, country income and geographical region in asia background: cancer incidence and mortality varies across region, sex and country’s economic status. while most studies focused on global trends, this study aimed to describe and analyse cancer incidence and mortality in asia, focusing on cancer site, sex, region and income status. methods: age-standardised incidence and mortality rates of cancer were extracted from the globocan 2012 database. cancer mortality to incidence ratios (mirs) were calculated to represent cancer survival. the data were analysed based on the four regions in asia and income. results: cancer incidence rate is lower in asia compared to the west but for mir, it is the reverse. in asia, the most common cancers in men are lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and oesophageal cancers while the most common cancers in women are breast, lung, cervical, colorectal and stomach cancers. the mirs are the highest in lung,",relationship pattern country income geographical region asia incidence mortality varies across region sex country economic status focus global trend describe analyse incidence mortality asia focus site sex region income status method age standardise incidence mortality rate extract globocan database mortality incidence ratio mirs calculate represent survival data analyse base four region asia income result incidence rate low asia compare west mir reverse asia common men lung stomach liver colorectal oesophageal common woman breast lung cervical colorectal stomach mirs high lung,d,Stomach Cancer
"Rare case of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp located at the fornix of the stomach and mimicking gastric cancer: a case report. Gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) is a rare polypoid lesion of the stomach that is characterized pathologically by the presence of spindle cells, a prominent network of blood vessels, and inflammatory infiltration of eosinophils. IFP is mainly located in the gastric antrum and is usually semi-pedunculated and covered with normal mucosa. There have been several reports of large IFPs with ulceration on the surface, at the apex, but no report of the IFP with ulceration at the fornix of the stomach. We report a case of IFP with ulceration that was suggested to be gastric cancer and was resected for diagnostic treatment. A 79-year-old woman presented to our hospital. During mass screening for cancer, stomach fluoroscopy revealed an abnormal shadow. Endoscopy showed an ulcerated tumor at the fornix of stomach; hence, gastric cancer was suggested because of the polypoid lesion with irregular ridges and ulceration. Pathological diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens revealed an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, and specific findings for gastric cancer were not obtained. Because we could not exclude gastric malignancies such as cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, we performed a partial resection of the stomach with a 2-cm margin using the laparoscopic-assisted method. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed that the tumor was present in the submucosal layer and consisted of collagen fiber containing inflammatory cell infiltration of mainly eosinophils. A prominent network of blood vessels was also found in the specimens. Immunohistochemical staining revealed mild positivity for CD34, and α-SMA and was negative for c-kit, DOG-1, s-100, desmin, ALK, and IgG4. The lesion was thus diagnosed as an IFP. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is currently asymptomatic and has shown no recurrence. IFPs have variable locational, morphological, histological, pathological, and immunohistochemical features. We reported that the gastric IFP was located at the fornix of the stomach and was similar in morphology to gastric cancer.

"Joint disease mapping using six cancers in the Yorkshire region of England. The aims of this study were to model jointly the incidence rates of six smoking related cancers in the Yorkshire region of England, to explore the patterns of spatial correlation amongst them, and to estimate the relative weight of smoking and other shared risk factors for the relevant disease sites, both before and after adjustment for socioeconomic background (SEB). Data on the incidence of oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers between 1983 and 2003 were extracted from the Northern & Yorkshire Cancer Registry database for the 532 electoral wards in the Yorkshire region. Using postcode of residence, each case was assigned an area-based measure of SEB using the Townsend index. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for each cancer site and their correlations investigated. The joint analysis of the spatial variation in incidence used a Bayesian shared-component model. Three components were included to represent differences in smoking (for all six sites), bodyweight/obesity (for oesophagus, pancreas and kidney cancers) and diet/alcohol consumption (for oesophagus and stomach cancers). The incidence of cancers of the oesophagus, pancreas, kidney, and bladder was relatively evenly distributed across the region. The incidence of stomach and lung cancers was more clustered around the urban areas in the south of the region, and these two cancers were significantly associated with higher levels of area deprivation. The incidence of lung cancer was most impacted by adjustment for SEB, with the rural/urban split becoming less apparent. The component representing smoking had a larger effect on cancer incidence in the eastern part of the region. The effects of the other two components were small and disappeared after adjustment for SEB. This study demonstrates the feasibility of joint disease modelling using data from six cancer sites. Incidence estimates are more precise than those obtained without smoothing. This methodology may be an important tool to help authorities evaluate healthcare system performance and the impact of policies.","joint disease mapping using six cancers in the yorkshire region of england. the aims of this study were to model jointly the incidence rates of six smoking related cancers in the yorkshire region of england, to explore the patterns of spatial correlation amongst them, and to estimate the relative weight of smoking and other shared risk factors for the relevant disease sites, both before and after adjustment for socioeconomic background (seb). data on the incidence of oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers between 1983 and 2003 were extracted from the northern & yorkshire cancer registry database for the 532 electoral wards in the yorkshire region. using postcode of residence, each case was assigned an area-based measure of seb using the townsend index. standardised incidence ratios (sirs) were calculated for each cancer site and their correlations investigated. the joint analysis of the spatial variation in incidence used a bayesian",joint map use six yorkshire region england model jointly incidence rate six smoking related yorkshire region england explore pattern spatial correlation amongst estimate relative weight smoking share risk factor relevant sit adjustment socioeconomic seb data incidence oesophagus stomach pancreas lung kidney bladder extract northern yorkshire registry database electoral ward yorkshire region use postcode residence assign area base measure seb use townsend index standardise incidence ratio sir calculate site correlation investigate joint spatial variation incidence use bayesian,d,Stomach Cancer
"Time trends in municipal distribution patterns of cancer mortality in Spain New disease mapping techniques widely used in small-area studies enable disease distribution patterns to be identified and have become extremely popular in the field of public health. This paper reports on trends in the geographical mortality patterns of the most frequent cancers in Spain, over a period of 20 years. We studied the municipal spatial pattern of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and urinary bladder cancer mortality in Spain across four quinquennia, spanning the period 1989-2008. Case data were broken down by town (8073 municipalities), period and sex. Expected cases for each town were calculated using reference rates for each five-year period. For map plotting purposes, smoothed municipal relative risks were calculated using the conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie, with independent data for each quinquennium. We evaluated the presence of spatial patterns in maps on the basis of models, calculating the variance in relative risk corresponding to the structured spatial component and the unstructured component, as well as the proportion of variance explained by the structured spatial component. The mortality patterns observed for stomach, colorectal and lung cancer were maintained over the 20 years covered by the study. Prostate cancer and the tumours studied in women showed no defined spatial pattern, with the single exception of stomach cancer. The trend in spatial fractional variance indicated the possibility of a change in the spatial pattern in breast, bladder and colorectal cancer in women during the last five-year period. The paper goes on to discuss ways in which spatio-temporal data are depicted in the case of cancer, and review the risk factors that may possibly influence the respective tumours’ spatial patterns. In men, the marked geographical patterns of stomach, colorectal, lung and bladder cancer remained stable over time. Breast, colorectal and bladder cancer in women show signs of the possible appearance of a spatial pattern in Spain and should therefore be monitored.","time trends in municipal distribution patterns of cancer mortality in spain new disease mapping techniques widely used in small-area studies enable disease distribution patterns to be identified and have become extremely popular in the field of public health. this paper reports on trends in the geographical mortality patterns of the most frequent cancers in spain, over a period of 20 years. we studied the municipal spatial pattern of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and urinary bladder cancer mortality in spain across four quinquennia, spanning the period 1989-2008. case data were broken down by town (8073 municipalities), period and sex. expected cases for each town were calculated using reference rates for each five-year period. for map plotting purposes, smoothed municipal relative risks were calculated using the conditional autoregressive model proposed by besag, york and mollie, with independent data for each quinquennium. we evaluated the presence of spatial patterns in maps on",time trend municipal distribution pattern mortality spain new mapping technique widely use small area enable distribution pattern identify become extremely popular field public health paper report trend geographical mortality pattern frequent spain period year municipal spatial pattern stomach colorectal lung breast prostate urinary bladder mortality spain across four quinquennium span period data break town municipality period sex expect town calculate use reference rate five year period map plotting smooth municipal relative risk calculate use conditional autoregressive model propose besag york mollie independent data quinquennium evaluate presence spatial pattern map,d,Stomach Cancer
"Nutrition deficiency increases the risk of stomach cancer mortality The purpose of the study is to determine whether exposure to malnutrition during early life is associated with increased risk of stomach cancer in later life. The design protocol included analyzing the trend of gastric cancer mortality and nutrition and evaluating the association between nutrient deficiency in early life and the risk of gastric cancer by hierarchical age–period–birth cohort (APC) analysis using general log-linear Poisson models and to compare the difference between birth cohorts who were exposed to the 1959–1961 Chinese famine and those who were not exposed to the famine. Data on stomach cancer mortality from 1970 to 2009 and the dietary patterns from 1955 to 1985 which included the 1959–1961 Chinese famine period in the Zhaoyuan County population were obtained. The nutrition information was collected 15 years prior to the mortality data as based on the latest reference of disease incubation. APC analysis revealed that severe nutrition deficiency during early life may increase the risk of stomach cancer. Compared with the 1960–1964 birth cohort, the risk for stomach cancer in all birth cohorts from 1900 to 1959 significantly increased; compared with the 1970–1974 cohort, the risk for stomach cancer in the 1975–1979 cohort significantly increased, whereas the others had a steadily decreased risk; compared with 85–89 age group in the 2005–2009 death survey, the ORs decreased with younger age and reached significant levels for the 50–54 age group after adjusting the confounding factors. The 1930 to 1964 group (exposed to famine) had a higher mortality rate than the 1965 to 1999 group (not exposed to famine). For males, the relative risk (RR) was 2.39 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.51 to 3.77. For females, RR was 1.64 and 95% CI was 1.02 to 2.62.

"A cross-national perspective of migration and cancer: incidence of five major cancer types among resettlers from the former Soviet Union in Germany and ethnic Germans in Russia Few studies compared cancer incidence among migrants both to their host countries and to their population of origin. We aimed to compare cancer incidence of ethnic Germans who migrated from the former Soviet Union to Germany (resettlers) to those living in Russia as well as to the German and the Russian general populations. The cancer registry of North Rhine-Westphalia identified incident cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer in resettlers and the general population of the administrative district of Munster (Germany) between 2004 and 2013. The Tomsk cancer registry collected the same data in ethnic Germans and the general population of the Tomsk region (Russia). We used standardised incidence rate ratios (SIRs) to compare rates of resettlers and ethnic Germans with the respective general populations. The total number of person-years under risk was 83,289 for ethnic Germans, 8,006,775 for the population of Tomsk, 219,604 for resettlers, and 20,516,782 for the population of Munster. Incidence of the five investigated cancer types among ethnic Germans did not differ from incidence of the general population of Tomsk. Compared to the general population of Tomsk, incidence among resettlers was higher for colorectal cancer in both sexes (females: SIR 1.45 [95% CI 1.14–1.83], males: SIR 1.56 [95% CI 1.23–1.97]), breast cancer in females (SIR 1.65 [95% CI 1.40–1.95]), and prostate cancer (SIR 1.64 [95% CI 1.34–2.01]). Incidence rates of these cancer types among resettlers were more similar to rates of the general population of Munster. Incidence of stomach and lung cancer did not differ between resettlers and the general population of Tomsk. After an average stay of 15 years, we observed that incidence of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer among resettlers converged to levels of the general population of Munster. Resettler’s incidence of stomach and lung cancer, however, was comparable to incidence in their population of origin. Causes must be investigated in subsequent analytical studies.","a cross-national perspective of migration and cancer: incidence of five major cancer types among resettlers from the former soviet union in germany and ethnic germans in russia few studies compared cancer incidence among migrants both to their host countries and to their population of origin. we aimed to compare cancer incidence of ethnic germans who migrated from the former soviet union to germany (resettlers) to those living in russia as well as to the german and the russian general populations. the cancer registry of north rhine-westphalia identified incident cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer in resettlers and the general population of the administrative district of munster (germany) between 2004 and 2013. the tomsk cancer registry collected the same data in ethnic germans and the general population of the tomsk region (russia). we used standardised incidence rate ratios (sirs) to compare rates of resettlers and ethnic germans with",cross national perspective migration incidence five major type among resettlers former soviet union germany ethnic german russia compare incidence among migrant host country population origin compare incidence ethnic german migrate former soviet union germany resettlers live russia well german russian general population registry north rhine westphalia identify incident stomach colorectal lung breast prostate resettlers general population administrative district munster germany tomsk registry collect data ethnic german general population tomsk region russia use standardise incidence rate ratio sirs compare rate resettlers ethnic german,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer variation associated with the position of the mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Inherited mutations of the BRCA2 gene give rise to a multi-site cancer phenotype which includes breast cancer (in female and males), ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, ocular and other melanomas, laryngeal, colon and stomach cancers. Interpretation of test results and risk assessment is therefore complex. It has been proposed that families with mutations in the ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11 (nucleotides 3035-6629) express a higher ratio of ovarian to breast cancer, than families with mutations elsewhere in the BRCA2 gene. In this study we have investigated the presence of 7 types of cancer (ovary, male breast, pancreas, prostate, colon, stomach and melanoma) in first- and second-degree relatives of mutation-positive individuals in 440 families with a BRCA2 mutation. We reviewed histories of cancer in relatives among families with mutations distributed throughout the gene. Families with ovarian cancer were more likely to harbour mutations in the OCCR (nucleotides 3035-6629) than elsewhere in the gene (OR = 2.21; P = 0.0002). We also compared cancer risks according to ethnic group. Ashkenazi Jewish families with the 6174delT founder mutation were more likely to have a family member with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.58; P = 0.002) and less likely to have a family member with prostate cancer (OR = 0.62; P = 0.04) than were non-Jewish families. In contrast, a reduced presence of ovarian cancer was found in families of French-Canadian ancestry, compared to other ancestries (OR = 0.37; P = 0.0026). A high risk of male breast cancer was observed with the 6503delTT mutation (OR = 15.7; P = 0.023). Families of Polish ancestry had a reduced frequency of pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.0; P = 0.03) compared to families of other ethnic origins. In conclusion, both the position of mutation and the ethnic background of the family appear to contribute to the phenotypic variation observed in families with BRCA2 mutations.","cancer variation associated with the position of the mutation in the brca2 gene. inherited mutations of the brca2 gene give rise to a multi-site cancer phenotype which includes breast cancer (in female and males), ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, ocular and other melanomas, laryngeal, colon and stomach cancers. interpretation of test results and risk assessment is therefore complex. it has been proposed that families with mutations in the ovarian cancer cluster region (occr) of exon 11 (nucleotides 3035-6629) express a higher ratio of ovarian to breast cancer, than families with mutations elsewhere in the brca2 gene. in this study we have investigated the presence of 7 types of cancer (ovary, male breast, pancreas, prostate, colon, stomach and melanoma) in first- and second-degree relatives of mutation-positive individuals in 440 families with a brca2 mutation. we reviewed histories of cancer in relatives among families with mutations distributed throughout the gene. families with",variation associate position mutation brca gene inherited mutation brca gene give rise multi site phenotype include breast female male ovarian pancreatic prostate ocular melanoma laryngeal colon stomach interpretation test result risk assessment therefore complex propose family mutation ovarian cluster region occr exon nucleotide express high ratio ovarian breast family mutation elsewhere brca gene investigate presence type ovary male breast pancreas prostate colon stomach melanoma first second degree relative mutation positive individual family brca mutation review history relative among family mutation distribute throughout gene family,d,Stomach Cancer

"Incidence and survival of oesophageal and gastric cancer in England between 1998 and 2007, a population-based study Background: Major changes in the incidence of oesophageal and gastric cancers have been reported internationally. This study describes recent trends in incidence and survival of subgroups of oesophageal and gastric cancer in England between 1998 and 2007 and considers the implications for cancer services and policy. Methods: Data on 133,804 English patients diagnosed with oesophageal and gastric cancer between 1998 and 2007 were extracted from the National Cancer Data Repository. Using information on anatomical site and tumour morphology, data were divided into six groups; upper and middle oesophagus, lower oesophagus, oesophagus with an unspecified anatomical site, cardia, non-cardia stomach, and stomach with an unspecified anatomical site. Age-standardised incidence rates (per 100,000 European standard population) were calculated for each group by year of diagnosis and by socioeconomic deprivation. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The majority of oesophageal cancers were in the lower third of the oesophagus (58%). Stomach with an unspecified anatomical site was the largest gastric cancer group (53%). The incidence of lower oesophageal cancer increased between 1998 and 2002 and remained stable thereafter. The incidence of cancer of the cardia, noncardia stomach, and stomach with an unspecified anatomical site declined over the 10 year period. Both lower oesophageal and cardia cancers had a much higher incidence in males compared with females (M:F 4:1). The incidence was also higher in the most deprived quintiles for all six cancer groups. Survival was poor in all subgroups with 1 year survival ranging from 14.8-40.8% and 5 year survival ranging from 3.7-15.6%. Conclusions: An increased focus on prevention and early diagnosis, especially in deprived areas and in males, is required to improve outcomes for these cancers. Improved recording of tumour site, stage and morphology and the evaluation of focused early diagnosis programmes are also needed. The poor long-term survival reinforces the need for early detection and multidisciplinary care.","incidence and survival of oesophageal and gastric cancer in england between 1998 and 2007, a population-based study background: major changes in the incidence of oesophageal and gastric cancers have been reported internationally. this study describes recent trends in incidence and survival of subgroups of oesophageal and gastric cancer in england between 1998 and 2007 and considers the implications for cancer services and policy. methods: data on 133,804 english patients diagnosed with oesophageal and gastric cancer between 1998 and 2007 were extracted from the national cancer data repository. using information on anatomical site and tumour morphology, data were divided into six groups; upper and middle oesophagus, lower oesophagus, oesophagus with an unspecified anatomical site, cardia, non-cardia stomach, and stomach with an unspecified anatomical site. age-standardised incidence rates (per 100,000 european standard population) were calculated for each group by year of diagnosis and by socioeconomic deprivation. survival was estimated using the kaplan-meier",incidence survival oesophageal gastric england population base major change incidence oesophageal gastric report internationally describe recent trend incidence survival subgroup oesophageal gastric england consider implication service policy method data english diagnose oesophageal gastric extract national data repository use information anatomical site morphology data divide six group upper middle oesophagus lower oesophagus oesophagus unspecified anatomical site cardia non cardia stomach stomach unspecified anatomical site age standardise incidence rate per european standard population calculate group year diagnosis socioeconomic deprivation survival estimate use kaplan meier,d,Stomach Cancer
"Surgical techniques, open versus minimally invasive gastrectomy after chemotherapy (STOMACH trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to provide important advantages in comparison with open procedures in the treatment of several malignant diseases, such as less perioperative blood loss and faster patient recovery. It also maintains similar results with regard to tumor resection margins and oncological long-term survival. In gastric cancer the role of laparoscopic surgery remains unclear. Current recommended treatment for gastric cancer consists of radical resection of the stomach, with a free margin of 5 to 6 cm from the tumor, combined with a lymphadenectomy. The extent of the lymphadenectomy is considered a marker for radicality of surgery and quality of care. Therefore, it is imperative that a novel surgical technique, such as minimally invasive total gastrectomy, should be non-inferior with regard to radicality of surgery and lymph node yield. The Surgical Techniques, Open versus Minimally invasive gastrectomy After CHemotherapy (STOMACH) study is a randomized, clinical multicenter trial. All adult patients with primary carcinoma of the stomach, in which the tumor is considered surgically resectable (T1-3, N0-1, M0) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, are eligible for inclusion and randomization. The primary endpoint is quality of oncological resection, measured by radicality of surgery and number of retrieved lymph nodes. The pathologist is blinded towards patient allocation. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) regarding quality of life, postoperative complications and cost-effectiveness. Based on a non-inferiority model for lymph node yield, with an average lymph node yield of 20, a non-inferiority margin of −4 and a 90% power to detect non-inferiority, a total of 168 patients are to be included. The STOMACH trial is a prospective, multicenter, parallel randomized study to define the optimal surgical strategy in patients with proximal or central gastric cancer after neo-adjuvant therapy: the conventional ‘open’ approach or minimally invasive total gastrectomy.

However, no large-scale study has thoroughly assessed the risk of suicide among adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer. This study was conducted to characterize suicide mortality among AYA patients in the US and identify risk factors associated with a higher risk of suicide. Methods Patients aged 15-39 years were residents of the US served by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, who were diagnosed with cancers from 1973 to 2015. Results We report that 981 of the 572,500 AYA patients with cancer committed suicide, for an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted suicide rate of 17.68/100,000 person-years. The rate of suicide was 14.33/100,000 person-years in the corresponding general population, giving a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.234 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.159-1.313]. Higher suicide rates were associated with male sex, white race, unmarried state, distant tumor stage, and single primary tumor. AYA patients with otorhinolaryngologic, gonad, stomach, soft tissue, and nasopharyngeal cancer were at the greatest risk of suicide compared with those with other types of cancer. In older patients (≥ 40 years), the risk was highest in those with lung, stomach, oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, and bone malignancies. SMRs were highest in the first 5 years after diagnosis for most types of cancer. Conclusion AYA patients with cancer in the US have over 20% higher the incidence of suicide of the general population, and most suicides occurred in the first 5 years following diagnosis. Suicide rates vary among patients with cancers of different anatomic sites. Further examination of the psychological experience of these young patients with cancer, particularly that of those with certain types of cancer, is warranted.","incidence of suicide among adolescent and young adult cancer patients: a population-based study. background as the survival rates of cancer patients continue to increase, most cancer patients now die of non-cancer causes. several studies have been showing elevated suicide rates among patients with cancer. however, no large-scale study has thoroughly assessed the risk of suicide among adolescent and young adult (aya) patients with cancer. this study was conducted to characterize suicide mortality among aya patients in the us and identify risk factors associated with a higher risk of suicide. methods patients aged 15-39 years were residents of the us served by the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program, who were diagnosed with cancers from 1973 to 2015. results we report that 981 of the 572,500 aya patients with cancer committed suicide, for an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted suicide rate of 17.68/100,000 person-years. the rate of suicide was 14.33/100,000 person-years",incidence suicide among adolescent young adult population base survival rate continue increase die non cause several show elevated suicide rate among however large scale thoroughly assess risk suicide among adolescent young adult aya conduct characterize suicide mortality among aya u identify risk factor associate high risk suicide method age year resident u serve surveillance epidemiology end result seer program diagnose result report aya commit suicide age sex race adjust suicide rate person year rate suicide person year,d,Stomach Cancer
"Trends and outcomes of robotic surgery for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in the USA: maintaining perioperative and oncologic safety. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) continues to gain traction as a feasible approach for the operative management of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. The aim of this study is to quantify national trends, perioperative and oncologic outcomes of MIS for the most common GI malignancies including the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum. We hypothesize that with more widespread use of MIS techniques, perioperative outcomes and oncologic resection quality will remain preserved. The National Cancer Database (2010–2014) was utilized to assess perioperative outcomes and pathologic quality of MIS (robotic and laparoscopic) compared to open, in patients who underwent resection for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum. Multilevel logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with postoperative and long-term outcomes. Data from 11,023 esophageal, 30,664 gastric, 30,689 pancreas, 260,669 colon, and 52,239 rectal resections were analyzed. Although laparoscopy is the most prevalent MIS approach, the number of robotic resections increased nearly fourfold from 2010 to 2014 in all organ sites (increase by factor: esophagus: 3.8, stomach: 4.4, pancreas: 4.4, colon: 3.8 and rectum: 4). The number of laparoscopic resections increased at a slower rate (factor: 1.3–1.9), whereas the number of open resections decreased (factor: 0.67–0.77). Patients who underwent robotic-assisted resections were younger for stomach and colorectal resections and with lower Charlson Comorbidity Index across all sites. Patients who underwent robotic or laparoscopic resections had shorter hospitalizations, fewer readmissions (with the exception of rectal resections) and lower postoperative mortality at 90 days. Robotic-assisted resections had comparable negative margin resections and number of lymph nodes to laparoscopic and open resections across all sites. The utilization of robotic-assisted resections of GI cancers is rapidly increasing with more frequent use in younger and healthier patients. This study demonstrates that with the rising utilization of robotic-assisted resections, perioperative outcomes and oncologic safety have not been compromised.","trends and outcomes of robotic surgery for gastrointestinal (gi) cancers in the usa: maintaining perioperative and oncologic safety. minimally invasive surgery (mis) continues to gain traction as a feasible approach for the operative management of gastrointestinal (gi) malignancies. the aim of this study is to quantify national trends, perioperative and oncologic outcomes of mis for the most common gi malignancies including the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum. we hypothesize that with more widespread use of mis techniques, perioperative outcomes and oncologic resection quality will remain preserved. the national cancer database (2010–2014) was utilized to assess perioperative outcomes and pathologic quality of mis (robotic and laparoscopic) compared to open, in patients who underwent resection for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum. multilevel logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with postoperative and long-term outcomes. data from 11,023 esophageal, 30,664 gastric, 30,689 pancreas, 260,669 colon,",trend outcome robotic surgery gastrointestinal gi usa maintaining perioperative oncologic safety minimally invasive surgery mi continue gain traction feasible approach operative management gastrointestinal gi malignancies quantify national trend perioperative oncologic outcome mi common gi malignancy include esophagus stomach pancreas colon rectum hypothesize widespread use mi technique perioperative outcome oncologic resection quality remain preserve national database utilize assess perioperative outcome pathologic quality mi robotic laparoscopic compare open underwent resection esophagus stomach pancreas colon rectum multilevel logistic regression model construct identify independent factor associate postoperative long term outcome data esophageal gastric pancreas colon,d,Stomach Cancer
"Exposure to radon progeny and cancer mortality, excluding lung cancer, in the cohort of Newfoundland Fluorspar Miners between 1950 and 2016. The increased risk of lung cancer from radon progeny among Newfoundland fluorspar miners is well established. In the present study, an internal cohort analysis was conducted to investigate whether radon progeny is also associated with increased mortality from other cancers. Consequently, associations between cumulative radon progeny and cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) were evaluated in a cohort of 2,110 miners. Mortality was ascertained from 1950 to 2016. Individual-level exposure to radon progeny in working level months (WLM) was determined for each miner during their employment. For cancers with at least ten deaths, Poisson regression was used to estimate excess relative risks (ERRs). Cancer site-specific relative risks were derived for mortality from common cancers within the cohort, specifically: colorectal, prostate, stomach and all cancers (excluding lung cancer). Relative risks were adjusted for age, calendar period, and the number of cigarettes smoked daily determined from smoking surveys. In total, 260 cancer deaths, excluding lung cancer, were identified during follow-up. The relative risk of death from these cancers was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92, 1.75) among underground miners with a cumulative exposure of ≥ 50 WLM when compared to those with < 1 WLM. The ERR per 100 WLM for cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) was 0.02 (95% CI=-0.01 to 0.05). No statistically significant increased risks with increasing exposure were found for bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancer. Overall, these findings provide modest evidence that radon progeny contributes to increased risks of cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) among fluorspar miners. However, the precision of the estimates is limited by the small size of the cohort, which restricts the ability to draw firm conclusions regarding specific cancer sites. Future research should consider pooling data from radon-exposed occupational cohorts to better understand the association between radon exposure and the risk of cancers other than lung cancer.","exposure to radon progeny and cancer mortality, excluding lung cancer, in the cohort of newfoundland fluorspar miners between 1950 and 2016. the increased risk of lung cancer from radon progeny among newfoundland fluorspar miners is well established. in the present study, an internal cohort analysis was conducted to investigate whether radon progeny is also associated with increased mortality from other cancers. consequently, associations between cumulative radon progeny and cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) were evaluated in a cohort of 2,110 miners. mortality was ascertained from 1950 to 2016. individual-level exposure to radon progeny in working level months (wlm) was determined for each miner during their employment. for cancers with at least ten deaths, poisson regression was used to estimate excess relative risks (errs). cancer site-specific relative risks were derived for mortality from common cancers within the cohort, specifically: colorectal, prostate, stomach and all cancers (excluding lung cancer). relative risks were",exposure radon progeny mortality exclude lung cohort newfoundland fluorspar miner increase risk lung radon progeny among newfoundland fluorspar miner well establish present internal cohort conduct investigate whether radon progeny also associate increased mortality consequently association cumulative radon progeny mortality exclude lung evaluate cohort miner mortality ascertain individual level exposure radon progeny work level month wlm determine miner employment least ten death poisson regression use estimate excess relative risk errs site specific relative risk derive mortality common within cohort specifically colorectal prostate stomach exclude lung relative risk,d,Stomach Cancer
"Proximal gastrectomy with exclusion of no. 3b lesser curvature lymph node dissection could be indicated for patients with advanced upper-third gastric cancer. Proximal gastrectomy has been introduced for early gastric cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, but expansion of its indication to advanced tumors has not been generally accepted in terms of lesser curvature lymph node dissection. We reviewed the medical records of 385 patients with tumors in the upper third of the stomach, and the incidence of metastasis and the therapeutic index related to the proximal (no. 3a) and distal (no. 3b) lymph nodes of the lesser curvature were analyzed and compared with those of tumors in the middle third (n = 1093) and lower third (n = 922) of the stomach. The no. 3a rate of metastasis from advanced tumors in the upper third of the stomach was significantly higher than that from tumors in the middle third or lower third of the stomach. The no. 3b metastasis rate did not show any significant differences between the three locations, but the therapeutic index of no. 3b lymph nodes in the upper third of the stomach (1.7) was far lower than that in the middle third (7.1) or lower third (7.0). Further, the rate of metastasis from tumors with the distal border ending in the upper third of the stomach (2.2 %) was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower than that from tumors located in the upper third of the stomach but extending to the middle third (19.6 %), as well as from tumors located in middle third (17.1 %) or lower third (19.6 %), with the therapeutic index being only 1.1. The four no.-3b-positive tumors all measured more than 40 mm, and included one T3 tumor and three T4 tumors.

"Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis of stomach cancer incidence in Iran, 2003–2010 Stomach cancer is the second most common cancer in Iranian men and the fourth most common cancer in Iranian women. The incidence rate of this cancer in Iranian men is almost 2.5 times that in women. The objective of this study was to investigate the trend of stomach cancer incidence rate in Iran in an 8-year time period (2003–2010) and also update the incidence estimates of stomach cancer. Data from a total number of 41,830 patients diagnosed with stomach cancer according to the International Classification of Diseases (C16) in 2003–2010 were analyzed. We used Bayesian spatial and Bayesian spatio-temporal models to study the relative risk and trend of stomach cancer incidence rate in Iran. Out of 41,830 stomach cancer registered patients, 72% were male. The average smoothed SIRs were 0.79, 0.82 and 0.78 for the general, female and male population, respectively. This shows a nearly stable incidence rate. The northwest of Iran had the highest incidence rate of stomach cancer. The trend of this rate was declining to the lowest rate in the southeast of the country. The estimated values of coefficient of the trend term for general, female and male population in this model were 0.0085, − 0.018 and 0.0041, which indicate almost a stable fixed trend. The map of temporal trends also showed that although the incidence rate of this cancer is to some extent stable, in general, in the central and in the east of the country the incidence relative risk has increased over time. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, Lower socioeconomic status and Iodine deficiency were speculated to be relevant factors for the high incidence rates of stomach cancer in the northwest of Iran. Preventive measures in the north and northwest of Iran could have an effect on controlling this cancer in these areas.","bayesian spatio-temporal analysis of stomach cancer incidence in iran, 2003–2010 stomach cancer is the second most common cancer in iranian men and the fourth most common cancer in iranian women. the incidence rate of this cancer in iranian men is almost 2.5 times that in women. the objective of this study was to investigate the trend of stomach cancer incidence rate in iran in an 8-year time period (2003–2010) and also update the incidence estimates of stomach cancer. data from a total number of 41,830 patients diagnosed with stomach cancer according to the international classification of diseases (c16) in 2003–2010 were analyzed. we used bayesian spatial and bayesian spatio-temporal models to study the relative risk and trend of stomach cancer incidence rate in iran. out of 41,830 stomach cancer registered patients, 72% were male. the average smoothed sirs were 0.79, 0.82 and 0.78 for the general, female and male population,",bayesian spatio temporal stomach incidence iran stomach second common iranian men fourth common iranian woman incidence rate iranian men almost time woman investigate trend stomach incidence rate iran year time period also update incidence estimate stomach data total number diagnose stomach accord international classification c analyze use bayesian spatial bayesian spatio temporal model relative risk trend stomach incidence rate iran stomach register male average smoothed sir general female male population,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer incidence in a population potentially exposed to radium-226 at Dalgety Bay, Scotland. Cancer incidence in the Dalgety Bay area of Fife, Scotland, was examined following the detection of radium-226 particles by routine radiation monitoring. The study was confounded by rapid population growth, demographic change and the relatively high socioeconomic status of the Dalgety Bay population. Health Board Primary Care Division records were used to calculate population estimates and Carstairs deprivation score was used to adjust for socioeconomic characteristics. In the period 1975-90, 211 residents were registered as having cancer compared with 214.21 expected from Scottish national rates. Of specific cancers possibly associated with radiation, the incidence of stomach, liver, lung, bone, prostate, bladder and kidney cancer and lymphoma were lower than expected while colon, rectum, pancreas, skin, breast and thyroid cancer and multiple myeloma and leukaemia were higher. There were three cases of childhood leukaemia compared with 1.22 expected. The only statistically significant differences observed were for pancreas (11 cases, O/E 2.28), lung (25 cases, O/E 0.65) and non-melanoma skin (36 cases, O/E 1.50). Stomach cancer was of borderline statistical significance (four cases, O/E 0.40). Adjustments for socioeconomic factors accounted for the apparently low incidence of stomach and lung cancer and, to a lesser extent, skin cancer, which remained of borderline statistical significance. Results in relation to pancreas cancer were unchanged. The observations of raised incidence of pancreas and skin cancer arose in the context of a survey of 17 cancer sites, from which the finding of two or more statistically significant results is not unusual (P = 0.21), and the numbers of cases involved were small. The epidemiological evidence for an association between radiation exposure and pancreas cancer risk is weak. Stronger evidence exists for an association with skin cancer. In the present study the anatomical distribution of the 36 cases was similar to that found elsewhere in Scotland.","cancer incidence in a population potentially exposed to radium-226 at dalgety bay, scotland. cancer incidence in the dalgety bay area of fife, scotland, was examined following the detection of radium-226 particles by routine radiation monitoring. the study was confounded by rapid population growth, demographic change and the relatively high socioeconomic status of the dalgety bay population. health board primary care division records were used to calculate population estimates and carstairs deprivation score was used to adjust for socioeconomic characteristics. in the period 1975-90, 211 residents were registered as having cancer compared with 214.21 expected from scottish national rates. of specific cancers possibly associated with radiation, the incidence of stomach, liver, lung, bone, prostate, bladder and kidney cancer and lymphoma were lower than expected while colon, rectum, pancreas, skin, breast and thyroid cancer and multiple myeloma and leukaemia were higher. there were three cases of childhood leukaemia compared with 1.22 expected.",incidence population potentially expose radium dalgety bay scotland incidence dalgety bay area fife scotland examine follow detection radium particle routine radiation monitor confound rapid population growth demographic change relatively high socioeconomic status dalgety bay population health board primary care division record use calculate population estimate carstairs deprivation score use adjust socioeconomic characteristic period resident register compare expect scottish national rate specific possibly associate radiation incidence stomach liver lung bone prostate bladder kidney lymphoma low expect colon rectum pancreas skin breast thyroid multiple myeloma leukaemia high three childhood leukaemia compare expect,d,Stomach Cancer
"Significance of (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose accumulation in the stomach on positron emission tomography. To explain the accumulation of 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose (18FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) in the stomach and differences in its pattern, we focus on the accumulation pattern in association with endoscopic findings of the gastric mucosa and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection. Of 599 cases undergoing 18FDG-PET examinations, we retrospectively analyzed the pattern of 18FDG accumulation in the stomach, findings of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and Hp infection. The pattern of 18FDG accumulation was classified into three groups: localized accumulation only in the fornix (Group A, 32 patients), diffuse accumulation throughout the entire stomach (Group B, 49 patients), and no accumulation (Group C, 191 patients). Regarding the relation between Hp infection and 18FDG accumulation, Hp infection was positive in 56.3% of Group A, 73.5% of Group B, and 24.1% of Group C, with significant differences (p < 0.001). Regarding the relation between 18FDG accumulation and gastric mucosal inflammation, when Groups A and B were compared with Group C, nearly half of the cases in the former groups had papular redness with a significantly higher frequency of redness and erosion. Three cases found to have malignant tumor were limited to the former groups. One MALT lymphoma case was also found in the same group. Accumulation of 18FDG largely corresponded to mucosal inflammation including superficial gastritis and erosive gastritis, and therefore the main cause of non-specific 18FDG accumulation was considered to be inflammatory mucosa (mainly redness). The accumulation pattern was not associated with atrophic changes of the gastric mucosa or with Hp infection, but with mucosal inflammatory changes, including redness and erosion localized to the fornix. Accumulation of 18FDG in the stomach suggests a high probability of the presence of inflammatory change in the gastric mucosa forming a background for the development of cancer or malignant lymphoma, and thus requires further endoscopic examinations.","significance of (18)f-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose accumulation in the stomach on positron emission tomography. to explain the accumulation of 18f-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose (18fdg) on positron emission tomography (pet) in the stomach and differences in its pattern, we focus on the accumulation pattern in association with endoscopic findings of the gastric mucosa and helicobacter pylori (hp) infection. of 599 cases undergoing 18fdg-pet examinations, we retrospectively analyzed the pattern of 18fdg accumulation in the stomach, findings of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and hp infection. the pattern of 18fdg accumulation was classified into three groups: localized accumulation only in the fornix (group a, 32 patients), diffuse accumulation throughout the entire stomach (group b, 49 patients), and no accumulation (group c, 191 patients). regarding the relation between hp infection and 18fdg accumulation, hp infection was positive in 56.3% of group a, 73.5% of group b, and 24.1% of group c, with significant differences (p < 0.001). regarding the relation between",significance f deoxy fluoro glucose accumulation stomach positron emission tomography explain accumulation f deoxy fluoro glucose fdg positron emission tomography pet stomach difference pattern focus accumulation pattern association endoscopic finding gastric mucosa helicobacter pylori hp infection undergo fdg pet examination retrospectively analyze pattern fdg accumulation stomach finding upper gastrointestinal endoscopy hp infection pattern fdg accumulation classify three group localize accumulation fornix group diffuse accumulation throughout entire stomach group b accumulation group c regard relation hp infection fdg accumulation hp infection positive group group b group c significant difference p regard relation,d,Stomach Cancer
"The demographic characteristics of histological types of gastric cancer with gender, age, and tumor location. The objective of this paper is to study demographic characteristics of different histological types with patient's gender, age, and tumor location in gastric cancer. Three hundred and fifty-one patients who had gastric cancer and undergone a D2 or greater gastrectomy were analyzed retrospectively. The association between gender and age, tumor location and histological types, including tubular adenocarcinoma (TUB), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (POR), signet-ring cell carcinoma (SIG), mucinous adenocarcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma (UND), were analyzed by chi-square test or Fisher exact test. The proportion of TUB in males was higher than that in females (52.4% vs 30.1%, p value of 0.000), and the proportion of SIG in females was higher than that in males (26.2% vs 12.9%, p = 0.002). The prevalence of TUB in patients aged >60 years (54.9%) was significantly higher than that in patients aged 40–60 years (42.2%) and <40 years (24.1%). The prevalence of SIG in the group aged <40 years was significantly higher than that in the other two age groups (44.8% vs 15.6%, 12.7%, p = 0.000).

"Monitoring circulating tumor DNA by analyzing personalized cancer-specific rearrangements to detect recurrence in gastric cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a candidate biomarker for cancer screening. However, studies on the usefulness of ctDNA for postoperative recurrence monitoring are limited. The present study monitored ctDNA in postoperative blood by employing cancer-specific rearrangements. Personalized cancer-specific rearrangements in 25 gastric cancers were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and were employed for ctDNA monitoring with blood up to 12 months after surgery. Personalized cancer-specific rearrangements were identified in 19 samples. The median lead time, which is the median duration between a positive ctDNA detection and recurrence, was 4.05 months. The presence of postoperative ctDNA prior to clinical recurrence was significantly correlated with cancer recurrence within 12 months of surgery (P = 0.029); in contrast, no correlation was found between cancer recurrence and the presence of preoperative ctDNA, suggesting the clinical usefulness of postoperative ctDNA monitoring for cancer recurrence in gastric cancer patients. However, the clinical application of ctDNA can be limited by the presence of ctDNA non-shedders (42.1%, 8/19) and by inconsistent postoperative ctDNA positivity. Fragments of tumor DNA, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), in blood can help predict stomach cancer recurrence within 12 months of surgery. Kyeong-Man Hong at the National Cancer Center, in Goyang-si, South Korea, and colleagues, carried out whole genome sequencing of stomach tumor samples from 25 patients to identify personalized cancer-specific rearranged DNA sequences. When they used this information to monitor ctDNA in blood samples obtained after surgical removal of the tumor, they found a significant correlation between the presence of ctDNA and cancer recurrence. In most cases, ctDNA was detected around four months prior to clinical recurrence, highlighting the potential usefulness of ctDNA monitoring. The lack of correlation between ctDNA levels and tumor size suggests that further research into the factors determining ctDNA levels is needed.","monitoring circulating tumor dna by analyzing personalized cancer-specific rearrangements to detect recurrence in gastric cancer. circulating tumor dna (ctdna) has emerged as a candidate biomarker for cancer screening. however, studies on the usefulness of ctdna for postoperative recurrence monitoring are limited. the present study monitored ctdna in postoperative blood by employing cancer-specific rearrangements. personalized cancer-specific rearrangements in 25 gastric cancers were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (wgs) and were employed for ctdna monitoring with blood up to 12 months after surgery. personalized cancer-specific rearrangements were identified in 19 samples. the median lead time, which is the median duration between a positive ctdna detection and recurrence, was 4.05 months. the presence of postoperative ctdna prior to clinical recurrence was significantly correlated with cancer recurrence within 12 months of surgery (p = 0.029); in contrast, no correlation was found between cancer recurrence and the presence of preoperative ctdna, suggesting the clinical usefulness of",monitor circulate dna analyze personalized specific rearrangement detect recurrence gastric circulate dna ctdna emerge candidate biomarker screen however usefulness ctdna postoperative recurrence monitoring limit present monitor ctdna postoperative blood employ specific rearrangement personalized specific rearrangement gastric analyze whole genome sequence wgs employ ctdna monitoring blood month surgery personalize specific rearrangement identify sample median lead time median duration positive ctdna detection recurrence month presence postoperative ctdna prior recurrence significantly correlate recurrence within month surgery p contrast correlation find recurrence presence preoperative ctdna suggest usefulness,d,Stomach Cancer
"Gastric cancer progression associated with local humoral immune responses Although the association between H. pylori and gastric cancer has been well described, the alterations studies are scarce in the humoral immune response in specific anatomical areas of stomach and during the stages of gastric cancer. The aim in this study was to determine the influence of humoral immune responses against H. pylori infection on gastric carcinoma. We selected 16 gastric cancer cases and approximately one matched control per case at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubiran (INCMNSZ); all the cases met the inclusion criteria for the study. We obtained three biopsies from each patient and from each of the predetermined regions of the stomach: antrum, angular portion, corpus, and fundus. From the patients with gastric cancer, additional biopsy specimens were obtained from tumor mid-lesion and tumor margin, and additional specimens were collected at least 2 and 5 cm from the tumor margin. We compared IgA levels against H. pylori in each area of stomach between cases and controls as well as between early and advanced stages of gastric cancer. IgA values were strikingly elevated in cancer cases compared with control subjects; a value that was even higher in the distant periphery of tumor but was remarkably decreased toward the carcinoma lesion. The advanced stages of gastric cancer demonstrated the relapse of the humoral immune response in the mid-lesion region of the tumor compared with the tumor margins and adjacent non-tumor tissue. Gastric cancer is characterized by progressive accumulation of a concentrated, specific IgA response against H. pylori, beginning with an abnormal increase in the entire stomach but particularly in the adjacent non-tumor tissue. Thus, it is possible that this strong immune response also participates in some degree in the damage and in the development of gastric cancer to some extent.","gastric cancer progression associated with local humoral immune responses although the association between h. pylori and gastric cancer has been well described, the alterations studies are scarce in the humoral immune response in specific anatomical areas of stomach and during the stages of gastric cancer. the aim in this study was to determine the influence of humoral immune responses against h. pylori infection on gastric carcinoma. we selected 16 gastric cancer cases and approximately one matched control per case at the national institute of medical sciences and nutrition salvador zubiran (incmnsz); all the cases met the inclusion criteria for the study. we obtained three biopsies from each patient and from each of the predetermined regions of the stomach: antrum, angular portion, corpus, and fundus. from the patients with gastric cancer, additional biopsy specimens were obtained from tumor mid-lesion and tumor margin, and additional specimens were collected at least 2 and",gastric progression associate local humoral immune response although association h pylorus gastric well describe alteration scarce humoral immune response specific anatomical area stomach stage gastric determine influence humoral immune response h pylori infection gastric carcinoma select gastric approximately one match control per national institute medical science nutrition salvador zubiran incmnsz meet inclusion criterion obtain three biopsy predetermined region stomach antrum angular portion corpus fundus gastric additional biopsy specimen obtain mid lesion margin additional specimen collect least,d,Stomach Cancer

"Epidemiological research in stomach cancer: progress over the last ten years. In this paper the progress of epidemiological research in stomach cancer during 1980–1990 is reviewed in respect to regional variation, etiology, and formation of carcinogens. The evaluation of 4 cohort and 16 case-control studies revealed a consistently inverse relationship of stomach cancer risk with raw vegetables, fruit, and wholemeal bread consumption and with vitamin C and carotene intake. Milk, cooked vegetables and vitamins A and E were not consistently found to be related to stomach cancer risk. Positive associations of increasing consumption with stomach cancer risk were occasionally found for processed or particularly prepared meat and fish, and for nitrite. Dietary nitrate intake did not appear to be related to stomach cancer risk in these studies. This latter observation is also supported by metabolic studies in high- and low-risk areas for stomach cancer. Consistently among studies, increased risk for stomach cancer was also found for later availability of refrigeration facilities in the household, non-centralized water supply (especially well water), and high salt intake. Prospective studies agreed in an increased risk for stomach cancer for cigarette smoking, but not for alcohol drinking, whereas case-control studies showed divergent results on these factors. Recent metabolic studies in high- and low-risk areas for stomach cancer or in groups with precursor lesions, with theN-nitrosoproline test as a marker for endogenous nitrosation, revealed inconsistent results. Higher nitrite concentration and increased pH in stomach juice were found to be associated with precursor conditions for stomach cancer. It is still not clear whether intake of preformed carcinogens or endogenous formation in the stomach with or without the inclusion of nitrite is the most important source of tumor-initiating or-promoting substances. Preservation or preparation of meat and fish may play an important role in this process, and vitamin C may be an inhibiting substance.","epidemiological research in stomach cancer: progress over the last ten years. in this paper the progress of epidemiological research in stomach cancer during 1980–1990 is reviewed in respect to regional variation, etiology, and formation of carcinogens. the evaluation of 4 cohort and 16 case-control studies revealed a consistently inverse relationship of stomach cancer risk with raw vegetables, fruit, and wholemeal bread consumption and with vitamin c and carotene intake. milk, cooked vegetables and vitamins a and e were not consistently found to be related to stomach cancer risk. positive associations of increasing consumption with stomach cancer risk were occasionally found for processed or particularly prepared meat and fish, and for nitrite. dietary nitrate intake did not appear to be related to stomach cancer risk in these studies. this latter observation is also supported by metabolic studies in high- and low-risk areas for stomach cancer. consistently among studies, increased risk for",epidemiological research stomach progress last ten year paper progress epidemiological research stomach review respect regional variation etiology formation carcinogen evaluation cohort control reveal consistently inverse relationship stomach risk raw vegetable fruit wholemeal bread consumption vitamin c carotene intake milk cook vegetable vitamins e consistently find relate stomach risk positive association increase consumption stomach risk occasionally find processed particularly prepared meat fish nitrite dietary nitrate intake appear relate stomach risk latter observation also support metabolic high low risk area stomach consistently among increase risk,d,Stomach Cancer

"Molecular mechanism of stomach carcinogenesis Gene changes in multiple oncogenes, multiple growth factors and multiple tumor-suppressor genes are observed in stomach cancer. Among them, those most commonly implicated in both well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma are inactivation (mutations and allele loss) of the p53 gene, and activation (abnormal expression and amplification) of the c-met gene. Moreover, they occur at an early stage of stomach carcinogenesis. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5q (APC locus) is frequently associated with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. LOH on chromosome 18q (DCC locus) and LOH of the bcl-2 gene also are common events of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. LOH on chromosomes 1q and 7q may be involved in the progression of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Conversely, the development of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in addition to changes in p53 and c-met genes, requires reduction or dysfunction of cadherin. Overexpression of bcl-2 protein is observed in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet-ring cell carcinoma. Moreover, the K-sam gene is amplified preferentially in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of scirrhous carcinoma. K-sam amplification in scirrhous carcinoma often occurs independently of c-met gene amplification. LOH on chromosome 1p also is relatively common in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Exceptionally, signet-ring cell carcinoma shares APC mutations. There are some differences in expression of the growth-factor/receptor system between well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Moreover, interaction between cell-adhesion molecules in tumor cells expressing c-met and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from stromal cells is linked with morphogenesis of two histological types of stomach cancer. Intestinal metaplasia and adenoma of the stomach also contain p53 mutations and K-ras mutations or tpr-met rearrangement. Taken together, different genetic pathways of stomach carcinogenesis may exist for poorly differentiated and well-differentiated stomach cancers. Some of the latter may develop by a cumulative series of gene alterations similar to those of colorectal cancer.","molecular mechanism of stomach carcinogenesis gene changes in multiple oncogenes, multiple growth factors and multiple tumor-suppressor genes are observed in stomach cancer. among them, those most commonly implicated in both well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma are inactivation (mutations and allele loss) of the p53 gene, and activation (abnormal expression and amplification) of the c-met gene. moreover, they occur at an early stage of stomach carcinogenesis. in addition, loss of heterozygosity (loh) on chromosome 5q (apc locus) is frequently associated with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. loh on chromosome 18q (dcc locus) and loh of the bcl-2 gene also are common events of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. loh on chromosomes 1q and 7q may be involved in the progression of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. conversely, the development of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in addition to changes in p53 and c-met genes, requires reduction or dysfunction of cadherin. overexpression of bcl-2 protein is observed in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or",molecular mechanism stomach carcinogenesis gene change multiple oncogene multiple growth factor multiple suppressor gene observe stomach among commonly implicate well differentiate adenocarcinoma poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma inactivation mutation allele loss p gene activation abnormal expression amplification c meet gene moreover occur early stage stomach carcinogenesis addition loss heterozygosity loh chromosome q apc locus frequently associate well differentiate adenocarcinoma loh chromosome q dcc locus loh bcl gene also common event well differentiate adenocarcinoma loh chromosome q q may involve progression well differentiate adenocarcinoma conversely development poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma addition change p c meet gene require reduction dysfunction cadherin overexpression bcl protein observe poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma,d,Stomach Cancer
"Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for gastric cancer in the proximal third of the stomach: a retrospective comparison with open surgery The incidence of cancer in the proximal third of the stomach is increasing. Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG) seems an attractive option for the treatment of early-stage proximal gastric cancer but has not gained wide acceptance because of technical difficulties, including the prevention of severe reflux. In this study, we describe our technique for LPG with jejunal interposition (LPG-IP) and evaluate its safety and feasibility. In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the data of patients with proximal gastric cancer who underwent LPG-IP (n = 22) or the same procedure with open surgery (OPG-IP; n = 68) between January 2008 and September 2011. Short-term surgical variables and outcomes were compared between the groups. The reconstruction method was the same in both groups, with creation of a 15 cm, single-loop, jejunal interposition for anastomosis. There were no differences in patient or tumor characteristics between the groups. Operation time was longer in the LGP-IP group (233 vs. 201 min, p = 0.0002) and estimated blood loss was significantly less (20 vs. 242 g, p < 0.0001). The average number of harvested lymph nodes did not differ between the two groups (17 vs. 20). There also were no differences in the incidence of leakage at the esophagojejunostomy anastomosis (9.1 vs. 7.4 %) or other postoperative complications (27 vs. 32 %). The number of times additional postoperative analgesia was required was significantly less in the LPG-IP group compared with the OPG-IP group (2 vs. 4, p < 0.0001). LPG-IP has equivalent safety and curability compared with OPG-IP. Our results imply that LPG-IP may lead to faster recovery, better cosmesis, and improved quality of life in the short-term compared with OPG-IP. Because of the limitations of retrospective analysis, a further study should be conducted to obtain definitive conclusions.","laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for gastric cancer in the proximal third of the stomach: a retrospective comparison with open surgery the incidence of cancer in the proximal third of the stomach is increasing. laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (lpg) seems an attractive option for the treatment of early-stage proximal gastric cancer but has not gained wide acceptance because of technical difficulties, including the prevention of severe reflux. in this study, we describe our technique for lpg with jejunal interposition (lpg-ip) and evaluate its safety and feasibility. in this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the data of patients with proximal gastric cancer who underwent lpg-ip (n = 22) or the same procedure with open surgery (opg-ip; n = 68) between january 2008 and september 2011. short-term surgical variables and outcomes were compared between the groups. the reconstruction method was the same in both groups, with creation of a 15 cm, single-loop, jejunal",laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy jejunal interposition gastric proximal third stomach retrospective comparison open surgery incidence proximal third stomach increase laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy lpg seem attractive option early stage proximal gastric gain wide acceptance technical difficulty include prevention severe reflux describe technique lpg jejunal interposition lpg ip evaluate safety feasibility retrospective review data proximal gastric undergo lpg ip n procedure open surgery opg ip n january september short term surgical variable outcome compare group reconstruction method group creation cm single loop jejunal,d,Stomach Cancer
"Evaluation and clinical significance of the stomach age model for evaluating aging of the stomach-a multicenter study in China A higher prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) occurs in younger adults in Asia. We used Stomach Age to examine the different mechanisms of CAG between younger adults and elderly individuals, and established a simple model of cancer risk that can be applied to CAG surveillance. Stomach Age was determined by FISH examination of telomere length in stomach biopsies. Δψm was also determined by flow cytometry. Sixty volunteers were used to confirm the linear relationship between telomere length and age while 120 subjects were used to build a mathematical model by a multivariate analysis. Overall, 146 subjects were used to evaluate the validity of the model, and 1,007 subjects were used to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and Δage (calculated from the mathematical model). ROC curves were used to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and Δage and to determine the cut-off point for Δage. We established that a tight linear relationship between the telomere length and the age. The telomere length was obvious different between patients with and without CAG even in the same age. Δψm decreased in individuals whose Stomach Age was greater than real age, especially in younger adults. A mathematical model of Stomach Age (real age + Δage) was successfully constructed which was easy to apply in clinical work. A higher Δage was correlated with a worse outcome. The criterion of Δage >3.11 should be considered as the cut-off to select the subgroup of patients who require endoscopic surveillance. Variation in Stomach Age between individuals of the same biological age was confirmed. Attention should be paid to those with a greater Stomach Age, especially in younger adults.

"Gastric cancer and diet. A pilot study on dietary habits in two districts differing markedly in respect of mortality from gastric cancer. THE mortality from gastric cancer is still conspicuously high in Ielancd, although some decline has been observed in recent years. Comparing standardized mortality rates for gastric cancer, 1960-61, in 24 countries, of which 16 were in Europe, Segi and Kurihara (1964) found by far the highest rates in Chile and Japan. For males the rates in these countries were 71-0 and 69-5 respectively per 100,000 and next in order came Austria and Finland with rates about 45 per 100,000. In Iceland the similarly standardized mortality rates, 1958-63, were 55-7 for males and 26-7 for females. For males the rate is distinctly higher than in any other country in Western Europe, but for females there is little difference between Iceland, Austria and Finland (Sigurjonsson, 1966a). It was suggested by Dungal (1961) that the unusual frequency and apparently uneven regional distribution of deaths from stomach cancer in Iceland might be related to consumption of smoked food such as meat, trout, salmon etc. Of known carcinogens, 3,4-benzopyrene was found in samples of smoked meat and trout together with other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as acenaphthy- lene, phenanthrene, fluorene and anthracene (Bailey and Dungal, 1958). Further, Dungal (1961) was able to produce malignant tumours in rats fed smoked mutton or trout. These tumours were generally of sarcomatous rather than carcinomatous nature and they appeared at various sites. Having these findings in mind a pilot study was planned to compare past dietary habits in two districts differing widely in respect of mortality from stomach cancer. The consumption of smoked food was to be given particular attention. The districts selected were Skagafjar6ars'sla (SKAG), in the northern part * Professor Niels Dungal died in October 1965, before the final draft of this paper had been prepared.","gastric cancer and diet. a pilot study on dietary habits in two districts differing markedly in respect of mortality from gastric cancer. the mortality from gastric cancer is still conspicuously high in ielancd, although some decline has been observed in recent years. comparing standardized mortality rates for gastric cancer, 1960-61, in 24 countries, of which 16 were in europe, segi and kurihara (1964) found by far the highest rates in chile and japan. for males the rates in these countries were 71-0 and 69-5 respectively per 100,000 and next in order came austria and finland with rates about 45 per 100,000. in iceland the similarly standardized mortality rates, 1958-63, were 55-7 for males and 26-7 for females. for males the rate is distinctly higher than in any other country in western europe, but for females there is little difference between iceland, austria and finland (sigurjonsson, 1966a). it was suggested by",gastric diet pilot dietary habit two district differ markedly respect mortality gastric mortality gastric still conspicuously high ielancd although decline observe recent year compare standardized mortality rate gastric country europe segi kurihara find far high rate chile japan male rate country respectively per next order come austria finland rate per iceland similarly standardized mortality rate male female male rate distinctly high country western europe female little difference iceland austria finland sigurjonsson suggest,d,Stomach Cancer

The SB length at the GC or LC side was not significantly different between subgroups categorized by tumor depth, size, and longitudinal location. When tumors were located at the anterior wall of the stomach, the length of the proximal SB (10.0 cm [9.0-11.0]) at the GC side was the longest.

"7. Cancers attributable to dietary factors in the UK in 2010. IV. Salt. In a large international ecological study, comparing urinary sodium excretion and stomach cancer mortality in 39 countries, Joossens et al (1996) concluded that ‘Salt intake, measured as 24-hour urine sodium excretion, is likely the rate-limiting factor of stomach cancer mortality at the population level'. On the basis of human observational and animal experimental data, as well as mechanistic plausibility, the 2003 report from the joint World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization Expert Consultation (WHO/FAO) concluded that salt-preserved food and salt ‘probably' increase the risk of gastric cancer (WHO/FAO, 2003). In fact, there is substantial evidence that the risk of gastric cancer is increased by high intakes of some traditionally preserved salted foods, especially meats and pickles, and with salt per se (Palli, 2000; Tsugane, 2005). The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) report (2007) concluded that ‘salt is a probable cause of stomach cancer', and that there is robust evidence for the mechanisms operating in humans.; ; In the UK, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) panel on Dietary Reference Values (Department of Health, 1991) advised that sodium (Na) intakes should be maintained below 3.2 g (or 8.0 g of salt) per day and set the reference nutrient intake (RNI) for men and women at 1.6 g of sodium (or 4.0 g of salt) per day. Following this, COMA's Cardiovascular Review Group recommended that salt intake should be gradually reduced further to a daily average of 6 g (Department of Health, 1994). This recommendation was also accepted in the food and health action plan ‘Choosing a better diet' (Department of Health, 2005).; ; In this section, we consider the population-attributable fraction of stomach cancer associated with an intake of salt >6 g per day.","7. cancers attributable to dietary factors in the uk in 2010. iv. salt. in a large international ecological study, comparing urinary sodium excretion and stomach cancer mortality in 39 countries, joossens et al (1996) concluded that ‘salt intake, measured as 24-hour urine sodium excretion, is likely the rate-limiting factor of stomach cancer mortality at the population level'. on the basis of human observational and animal experimental data, as well as mechanistic plausibility, the 2003 report from the joint world health organization/food and agriculture organization expert consultation (who/fao) concluded that salt-preserved food and salt ‘probably' increase the risk of gastric cancer (who/fao, 2003). in fact, there is substantial evidence that the risk of gastric cancer is increased by high intakes of some traditionally preserved salted foods, especially meats and pickles, and with salt per se (palli, 2000; tsugane, 2005). the world cancer research fund (wcrf) report (2007) concluded that ‘salt is",attributable dietary factor uk iv salt large international ecological compare urinary sodium excretion stomach mortality country joossens et al conclude salt intake measure hour urine sodium excretion likely rate limit factor stomach mortality population level basis human observational animal experimental data well mechanistic plausibility report joint world health organization food agriculture organization expert consultation fao conclude salt preserve food salt probably increase risk gastric fao fact substantial evidence risk gastric increase high intake traditionally preserve salt food especially meat pickle salt per se palli tsugane world research fund wcrf report conclude salt,d,Stomach Cancer
"Validity of modified gastrectomy combined with sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer Background. The present study examined the clinical validity of modifi ed gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, in terms of the results of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS), using infrared ray electronic endoscopy (IREE) plus indocyanine green (ICG) staining. Methods. One-hundred and sixty-one patients with fT1N0 gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. ICG (0.5 ml, 5 mg/ ml) was injected endoscopically into four quadrants of the submucosa surrounding the cancer. Twenty minutes after the injection, sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) stained with ICG were observed intraperitoneally around the serosa and surrounding fat tissue. IREE was used to illuminate regional lymph nodes from the serosal side. Results. Group 2 lymph nodes were judged as SNs in 52 patients (32%). The most common locations of the SNs were stations No. 7 in each of the upper-, middle-, and lower-thirds of the stomach. In two patients, lymph node metastasis was positive. One of these patients, with cancer in the middle onethird of the stomach, had SNs in stations No. 3, 4sb, 4d, 7, and No. 11p, and had metastatic lymph nodes in No. 3 and No. 7 (all SNs). The other patient, with cancer in the lower one-third of the stomach, had SNs in No. 1, 3, 4d, and 6, and had a metastatic lymph node in No. 4d (SN). Skip metastasis was not observed in this study, and metastatic lymph nodes were judged to have been dissected by the D1+a procedure. Conclusion. For T1N0 gastric cancer, modifi ed gastrectomy (D1+a dissection) combined with SNNS is suitable; however, for those whose Group 2 lymph nodes are judged to be SNs, additional dissection of lymphatic basins detected by SNNS should be performed to confi rm the absence of lymph node metastasis.","validity of modified gastrectomy combined with sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer background. the present study examined the clinical validity of modifi ed gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, in terms of the results of sentinel node navigation surgery (snns), using infrared ray electronic endoscopy (iree) plus indocyanine green (icg) staining. methods. one-hundred and sixty-one patients with ft1n0 gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. icg (0.5 ml, 5 mg/ ml) was injected endoscopically into four quadrants of the submucosa surrounding the cancer. twenty minutes after the injection, sentinel lymph nodes (sns) stained with icg were observed intraperitoneally around the serosa and surrounding fat tissue. iree was used to illuminate regional lymph nodes from the serosal side. results. group 2 lymph nodes were judged as sns in 52 patients (32%). the most common locations of the sns were stations no. 7 in each of the upper-, middle-, and lower-thirds",validity modified gastrectomy combine sentinel node navigation surgery early gastric present examine validity modifi ed gastrectomy early gastric term result sentinel node navigation surgery snns use infrared ray electronic endoscopy iree plus indocyanine green icg stain method one hundred sixty one ft n gastric enrol icg ml mg ml inject endoscopically four quadrant submucosa surround twenty minute injection sentinel lymph node sns stain icg observe intraperitoneally around serosa surround fat tissue iree use illuminate regional lymph node serosal side result group lymph node judge sn common location sn station upper middle low third,d,Stomach Cancer
"Update of cancer incidence among workers at a copper/nickel smelter and nickel refinery. Objectives: To assess cancer risk among nickel-exposed workers. Methods: We updated cancer incidence among 1388 workers employed for at least 3 months at a copper/nickel smelter and nickel refinery in Harjavalta, Finland. There were 1155 workers exposed to nickel during the period 1960–1985 in the smelter (566 workers), repair shop (239 workers), or refinery (418 workers). Cancer incidence was followed through the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry up to 31 December 1995. For overall cancer and for a priori selected specific cancer types the ratio of observed to expected numbers of cases was computed as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR), controlled for age, gender, and calendar period and using the region-specific rates as a reference. Results: The overall cancer incidence among both nickel-exposed and unexposed subcohorts was at the expected level. A small increase in lung cancer incidence, which reached statistical significance among workers with a latency exceeding 20 years, was observed among the smelter workers exposed to insoluble nickel compounds. Among workers in the refinery, who were exposed primarily to nickel sulfate at levels below 0.5 mg/m3 as well as to low concentrations of other nickel compounds, there was an increased risk for nasal cancer (SIR 41.1, 95% CI 4.97–148), positively associated with latency and duration of employment, and an excess risk for stomach (SIR 4.98, 95% CI 1.62–11.6) and lung (SIR 2.61, 95% CI 0.96–5.67) cancers. Conclusions: Since elevated nasal and lung cancer risks were confined to the refinery, where the primary exposure was to nickel sulfate, it is likely that nickel sulfate is mainly responsible for the elevated respiratory cancer risk. We cannot rule out whether the excess stomach cancer risk is a chance finding, or related to the working environment.","update of cancer incidence among workers at a copper/nickel smelter and nickel refinery. objectives: to assess cancer risk among nickel-exposed workers. methods: we updated cancer incidence among 1388 workers employed for at least 3 months at a copper/nickel smelter and nickel refinery in harjavalta, finland. there were 1155 workers exposed to nickel during the period 1960–1985 in the smelter (566 workers), repair shop (239 workers), or refinery (418 workers). cancer incidence was followed through the files of the finnish cancer registry up to 31 december 1995. for overall cancer and for a priori selected specific cancer types the ratio of observed to expected numbers of cases was computed as a standardized incidence ratio (sir), controlled for age, gender, and calendar period and using the region-specific rates as a reference. results: the overall cancer incidence among both nickel-exposed and unexposed subcohorts was at the expected level. a small increase in lung",update incidence among worker copper nickel smelter nickel refinery assess risk among nickel expose worker method update incidence among worker employ least month copper nickel smelter nickel refinery harjavalta finland worker expose nickel period smelter worker repair shop worker refinery worker incidence follow file finnish registry december overall priori select specific type ratio observe expect number compute standardized incidence ratio sir control age gender calendar period use region specific rate reference result overall incidence among nickel expose unexposed subcohorts expected level small increase lung,d,Stomach Cancer
"Investigation of gastric cancers in nude mice using X-ray in-line phase contrast imaging. Background: This paper is to report the new imaging of gastric cancers without the use of imaging agents. Both gastric normal regions and gastric cancer regions can be distinguished by using the principal component analysis (PCA) based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Methods: Human gastric cancer BGC823 cells were implanted into the stomachs of nude mice. Then, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 days after cancer cells implantation, the nude mice were sacrificed and their stomachs were removed. X-ray in-line phase contrast imaging (XILPCI), an X-ray phase contrast imaging method, has greater soft tissue contrast than traditional absorption radiography and generates higher-resolution images. The gastric specimens were imaged by an XILPCIs’ charge coupled device (CCD) of 9 μm image resolution. The PCA of the projective images’ region of interests (ROIs) based on GLCM were extracted to discriminate gastric normal regions and gastric cancer regions. Different stages of gastric cancers were classified by using support vector machines (SVMs). Results: The X-ray in-line phase contrast images of nude mice gastric specimens clearly show the gastric architectures and the details of the early gastric cancers. The phase contrast computed tomography (CT) images of nude mice gastric cancer specimens are better than the traditional absorption CT images without the use of imaging agents. The results of the PCA of the texture parameters based on GLCM of normal regions is (F1 +F 2) > 8.5, but those of cancer regions is (F1 +F 2) < 8.5. The classification accuracy is 83.3% that classifying gastric specimens into different stages using SVMs. Conclusions: This is a very preliminary feasibility study. With further researches, XILPCI could become a noninvasive method for future the early detection of gastric cancers or medical researches.","investigation of gastric cancers in nude mice using x-ray in-line phase contrast imaging. background: this paper is to report the new imaging of gastric cancers without the use of imaging agents. both gastric normal regions and gastric cancer regions can be distinguished by using the principal component analysis (pca) based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix (glcm). methods: human gastric cancer bgc823 cells were implanted into the stomachs of nude mice. then, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 days after cancer cells implantation, the nude mice were sacrificed and their stomachs were removed. x-ray in-line phase contrast imaging (xilpci), an x-ray phase contrast imaging method, has greater soft tissue contrast than traditional absorption radiography and generates higher-resolution images. the gastric specimens were imaged by an xilpcis’ charge coupled device (ccd) of 9 μm image resolution. the pca of the projective images’ region of interests (rois) based on glcm were extracted",investigation gastric nude mouse use x ray line phase contrast image paper report new imaging gastric without use image agent gastric normal region gastric region distinguish use principal component pca base gray level co occurrence matrix glcm method human gastric bgc cell implant stomach nude mouse day cell implantation nude mouse sacrifice stomach remove x ray line phase contrast image xilpci x ray phase contrast image method great soft tissue contrast traditional absorption radiography generate high resolution image gastric specimen image xilpcis charge couple device ccd image resolution pca projective image region interest rois base glcm extract,d,Stomach Cancer
"Characterization and risk estimate of cancer in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome The purpose of this study is to characterize the risk of cancer in a large cohort of patients with primary Sjogren syndrome (SjS). We had analyzed the development of cancer in 1300 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 SjS classification criteria. The baseline clinical and immunological characteristics and systemic activity (ESSDAI scores) were assessed at diagnosis as predictors of cancer using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis and gender. The sex-and age-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of cancer were estimated from 2012 Spanish mortality data. After a mean follow-up of 91 months, 127 (9.8%) patients developed 133 cancers. The most frequent type of cancer was B-cell lymphoma (including 27 MALT and 19 non-MALT B-cell lymphomas). Systemic activity at diagnosis of primary SjS correlated with the risk of hematological neoplasia and cryoglobulins with a high risk of either B-cell or non-B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Patients with cytopenias had a high risk of non-MALT B-cell and non-B-cell cancer, while those with low C3 levels had a high risk of MALT lymphomas and those with monoclonal gammopathy and low C4 levels had a high risk of non-MALT lymphomas. The estimated SIR for solid cancer was 1.13 and 11.02 for hematological cancer. SIRs for specific cancers were 36.17 for multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases, 19.41 for Hodgkin lymphoma, 6.04 for other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 5.17 for thyroid cancer, 4.81 for cancers of the lip and oral cavity, and 2.53 for stomach cancer. One third of cancers developed by patients with primary SjS are B-cell lymphomas. The prognostic factors identified at SjS diagnosis differed according to the subtype of B-cell lymphoma developed. Primary SjS is also associated with the development of some non-hematological cancers (thyroid, oral cavity, and stomach).","characterization and risk estimate of cancer in patients with primary sjögren syndrome the purpose of this study is to characterize the risk of cancer in a large cohort of patients with primary sjogren syndrome (sjs). we had analyzed the development of cancer in 1300 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 sjs classification criteria. the baseline clinical and immunological characteristics and systemic activity (essdai scores) were assessed at diagnosis as predictors of cancer using cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis and gender. the sex-and age-specific standardized incidence ratios (sir) of cancer were estimated from 2012 spanish mortality data. after a mean follow-up of 91 months, 127 (9.8%) patients developed 133 cancers. the most frequent type of cancer was b-cell lymphoma (including 27 malt and 19 non-malt b-cell lymphomas). systemic activity at diagnosis of primary sjs correlated with the risk of hematological neoplasia and cryoglobulins with a high risk",characterization risk estimate primary sj gren syndrome characterize risk large cohort primary sjogren syndrome sjs analyze development consecutive fulfil sjs classification criteria baseline immunological characteristic systemic activity essdai score assess diagnosis predictor use cox proportional hazard regression adjust age diagnosis gender sex age specific standardized incidence ratio sir estimate spanish mortality data mean follow month develop frequent type b cell lymphoma include malt non malt b cell lymphomas systemic activity diagnosis primary sjs correlate risk hematological neoplasia cryoglobulins high risk,d,Stomach Cancer

"Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery for leiomyosarcoma of the stomach: a case report with a review of the literature. Background Leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumor that could originate from the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, kidney, retroperitoneum, and the soft tissues of the extremities. It accounts for only 1% of all gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors and primary leiomyosarcoma of the stomach is extremely rare. Most cases reported as leiomyosarcoma of the stomach before the development of KIT immunohistochemistry might be gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach and only 18 cases of leiomyosarcoma of the stomach have been reported since early 2000s. We report here a patient with leiomyosarcoma of the stomach treated by laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS). Case presentation A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital for an early gastric cancer, which was initially treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection. Six months after his initial treatment, a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a small polypoid lesion at the lesser curvature of the proximal stomach, which appeared to be a hyperplastic polyp. However, one and a half years later, the lesion grew and showed more irregular surface. Biopsy at the time revealed smooth muscle cell proliferation suggestive of leiomyoma. Three years later, the lesion grew even larger and biopsy showed pleomorphic spindle cells. Immunohistochemical study showed positive staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin, but negative for c-kit and CD34. Ki-67 labeling index was nearly 60%. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was established. The patient subsequently underwent a partial gastrectomy by LECS. The patient is currently in good condition without recurrence or metastasis at 12 months after surgery. Conclusions Leiomyosarcoma of the stomach is extremely rare. This is the first report of leiomyosarcoma of the stomach treated by LECS.

"Thoracic stomach syndrome after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer mimicking tension pneumothorax: a case report Sudden onset of respiratory failure is one of the most fearful manifestations in intensive care units. Among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. However, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. A 49-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. Despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Hence, an aspiration catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. However, her clinical symptoms did not improve. Chest computed tomography was performed, which revealed a significantly distended reconstructed stomach that was compressing the nearby lung parenchyma. Her respiration improved immediately after nasogastric tube placement. After the procedure, we successfully extubated the patient. Similar to tension pneumothorax, thoracic stomach syndrome requires immediate drainage of air from the thoracic cavity. However, unlike tension pneumothorax, this condition requires nasogastric tube insertion, which is the only way to safely remove the accumulated air and avoid possible complications that could occur due to percutaneous drainage. For patient safety, it might be clinically important to place nasogastric tubes after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction, even if radiographic guidance is required. In addition, clinicians should consider thoracic stomach syndrome as one of the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure after whole-stomach esophagectomy.","thoracic stomach syndrome after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer mimicking tension pneumothorax: a case report sudden onset of respiratory failure is one of the most fearful manifestations in intensive care units. among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. however, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. we report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. a 49-year-old asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive",thoracic stomach syndrome whole stomach esophagectomy esophageal mimic tension pneumothorax report sudden onset respiratory failure one fearful manifestation intensive care unit among differential diagnosis respiratory failure tension pneumothorax life threaten require immediate invasive intervention drain air thoracic cavity however etiology manifestation similar tension pneumothorax also consider whole stomach esophagectomy esophageal report rare thoracic stomach syndrome mimic tension pneumothorax esophagectomy whole stomach reconstruction year old asian woman admit intensive care unit esophagectomy esophageal whole stomach reconstruction sedation intubated despite initial stable vital sign rapidly develop tachypnea low blood pressure low oxygen saturation chest radiography reveal mediastinal shift lead presumptive,d,Stomach Cancer
"Bilateral metastatic ovarian tumors (Krukenberg’s tumors) in the course of stomach cancer Presented is a rare case of bilateral neoplastic metastases to the ovaries (Krukenberg's tumors) and to the fundus of the uterus which occurred in the course of stomach cancer in a 46-year-old female who was treated surgically in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Regional Hospital in Slupsk. The patient was admitted secondary to bilateral ovarian masses. Her past medical history included peptic ulcer disease for a few years, confirmed by gastroscopic biopsy in July of 2000. The surgery performed in our department revealed bilateral ovarian tumors, each measuring about 10 cm in diameter, which were completely removed along with the fundus of the uterus. The intraoperative histologic diagnosis was ovarian cancer. No other macroscopic neoplastic changes were found during the surgery. During surgical removal of the gastrocolic ligament a group of enlarged lymph nodes at the greater curvature of the stomach in the proximity of the spleen was incidentally noticed. The intraoperative histology of the lymph nodes described metastatic neoplasia. Another intraoperative biopsy was also performed of the stomach because of atypical clinical presentation of the ovarian cancer. The pathologic diagnosis was stomach cancer. Upon the consultation with pathologists it was concluded that the primary tumor came from the stomach while the changes in the ovaries and lymph nodes were metastatic.

"Microflora of gastric biopsies from patients with duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer: a comparative study of patients from Korea, Colombia, and the United States. It remains unclear why the spectrum of H. pylori-related diseases differs among different geographic regions. We examined the non-H. pylori contamination rates of the stomach in patients with duodenal ulcer or gastric adenocarcinoma from three different regions with different spectra of H. pylori-related diseases. Gastric biopsies were cultured from patients with duodenal ulcer or histologically proven gastric cancer from Seoul, Korea; Bogota, Colombia; and Houston, Texas. The frequency of non-H. pylori contamination was tallied in relation to the clinical diagnosis. Cultures from 247 duodenal ulcer patients and 165 patients with gastric cancer had bacterial growth. H. pylori was isolated from 207 (73.7%) patients with duodenal ulcer and 90 (47.1%) patients with gastric cancer (P 0.143 for DU, P > 0.190 for GC) between regions. The frequency of isolation ranged from 69% to 79% for DU patients and from 39% to 50% for gastric cancer patients. Non-H. pylori bacterial contamination was found more frequently (63%) in Colombian duodenal ulcer patients compared to 30% ulcer patients from the United States or Korea (P < 0.001). Non-H. pylori growth occurred in 50.8-75.5% of cancer patients and was significantly lower in US patients than in patients from either Colombia or Korea (P < 0.01). The geographic location as well as disease status affects the rate of H. pylori recovery and non-H. pylori contamination of the stomach and may play a role in the geographic differences in manifestation of H. pylori infection. The fact that the proportion of gastric cancer patients in the United States with non-H. pylori contamination was significantly less than that of Korea or Colombia shows that the notion of an almost universal increase in gastric microbial content in gastric adenocarcinoma should be reconsidered.","microflora of gastric biopsies from patients with duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer: a comparative study of patients from korea, colombia, and the united states. it remains unclear why the spectrum of h. pylori-related diseases differs among different geographic regions. we examined the non-h. pylori contamination rates of the stomach in patients with duodenal ulcer or gastric adenocarcinoma from three different regions with different spectra of h. pylori-related diseases. gastric biopsies were cultured from patients with duodenal ulcer or histologically proven gastric cancer from seoul, korea; bogota, colombia; and houston, texas. the frequency of non-h. pylori contamination was tallied in relation to the clinical diagnosis. cultures from 247 duodenal ulcer patients and 165 patients with gastric cancer had bacterial growth. h. pylori was isolated from 207 (73.7%) patients with duodenal ulcer and 90 (47.1%) patients with gastric cancer (p 0.143 for du, p > 0.190 for gc) between regions. the frequency",microflora gastric biopsy duodenal ulcer gastric comparative korea colombia united state remain unclear spectrum h pylorus relate differs among different geographic region examine non h pylori contamination rate stomach duodenal ulcer gastric adenocarcinoma three different region different spectrum h pylorus relate gastric biopsy culture duodenal ulcer histologically proven gastric seoul korea bogota colombia houston texas frequency non h pylori contamination tally relation diagnosis culture duodenal ulcer gastric bacterial growth h pylorus isolate duodenal ulcer gastric p du p gc region frequency,d,Stomach Cancer
"Time trends of cancer incidence and mortality in Catalonia during 1993-2007. To describe time trends of cancer in Catalonia, Spain, during the period 1993–2007. Data have been provided by two population-based cancer registries, Girona and Tarragona, and the Catalan mortality registry. Cancer incidence in Catalonia has been estimated through modeling methods using data from these health structures. During 2003–2007, there were 20,042 cancer cases and 9,842 deaths per year among men and 13,673 new cancer cases and 5,882 deaths among women. The most frequent incident cancers among men were prostate (N = 4,258), lung (N = 3,021), colorectal (N = 3,007) and bladder (N = 2,238), whereas among women they were breast (N = 3,907), colorectal (N = 2,088), corpus uteri (N = 734) and lung (N = 527). During 1993–2007, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) rose 1.2 % per year among men [prostate (6.3 %), testis (5.7 %), kidney (2.9 %), liver (2.2 %) and colorectal (2.1 %)]. ASIRs decreased for stomach (−2.9 %), oral cavity and pharynx (−2.8 %), larynx (−2.7 %) and esophagus (−2 %). Among women, ASIRs only rose for lung (5.2 %), kidney (3.1 %), oral cavity and pharynx (2.6 %) and thyroid (1.6 %). ASIRs decreased for corpus uteri (−2.3 %), stomach (−1.7 %) and ovary (−1.6 %). Cancer mortality decreased −1.3 % per year among men and −2.1 % among women during the same period. Among men, the decrease of incidence/mortality of tobacco-related tumors was related to a reduction of smoking prevalence. Among women, the stabilization of breast cancer incidence and the rise of lung cancer incidence are similar to that observed in most European regions. These results allow assessing the effectiveness of public health strategies and they pose new frontiers for cancer control in Catalonia.","time trends of cancer incidence and mortality in catalonia during 1993-2007. to describe time trends of cancer in catalonia, spain, during the period 1993–2007. data have been provided by two population-based cancer registries, girona and tarragona, and the catalan mortality registry. cancer incidence in catalonia has been estimated through modeling methods using data from these health structures. during 2003–2007, there were 20,042 cancer cases and 9,842 deaths per year among men and 13,673 new cancer cases and 5,882 deaths among women. the most frequent incident cancers among men were prostate (n = 4,258), lung (n = 3,021), colorectal (n = 3,007) and bladder (n = 2,238), whereas among women they were breast (n = 3,907), colorectal (n = 2,088), corpus uteri (n = 734) and lung (n = 527). during 1993–2007, age-standardized incidence rates (asirs) rose 1.2 % per year among men [prostate (6.3 %), testis (5.7 %), kidney (2.9",time trend incidence mortality catalonia describe time trend catalonia spain period data provide two population base registry girona tarragona catalan mortality registry incidence catalonia estimate model method use data health structure death per year among men new death among woman frequent incident among men prostate n lung n colorectal n bladder n whereas among woman breast n colorectal n corpus uteri n lung n age standardize incidence rate asirs rise per year among men prostate testis kidney,d,Stomach Cancer

"Outcome of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach after gastrectomy: clinicopathologic study and reclassification according to the revised European-American lymphoma classification. Background. The best treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the stomach is still uncertain. The revised European-American lymphoma (REAL) classification has helped to define new, potentially more appropriate classification schemes for gastric lymphomas. Methods. Fifty-one resected gastric lymphomas were reclassified according to the REAL classification, and the efficacy of multimodal treatment was examined retrospectively. The principal treatment plan consisted of: (1) surgical resection of the stomach with lymph node dissection, followed by (2) systemic chemotherapy, mainly using the cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (CHOP) regimen. Results. According to the Ann Arbor classification, 27 patients had stage IE, 19 had stage IIE, and 5 had stage IV NHL. Using the REAL classification, we diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) in 23 patients, marginal zone B-cell (low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT]-type) lymphoma in 22, follicle center lymphoma in 4, mantle cell lymphoma in 1, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma in 1 patient. Nine of the 51 patients relapsed, and 8 patients with DLBL died of cancer. Survival rates at 5 years after surgery were 96.0% for stage IE, 83.3% for stage IIE, and 87.0% for all patients. Univariate analysis indicated that the tumor histology (according to the REAL classification), depth of invasion, degree of nodal involvement, Ann Arbor staging, and chemotherapy had an impact on patient outcome (P = 0.0018; P = 0.0002; P = 0.0308; P = 0.0016, and P = 0.0118, respectively). Conclusions. These data reveal that gastric NHL, especially of the low-grade MALT-type, often remains localized and has a good prognosis after surgery. The REAL classification was useful for classifying new categories of NHL, including the MALT-type, in the clinical setting, and for determining the optimal treatment modality for gastric NHL.","outcome of patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach after gastrectomy: clinicopathologic study and reclassification according to the revised european-american lymphoma classification. background. the best treatment for patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl) of the stomach is still uncertain. the revised european-american lymphoma (real) classification has helped to define new, potentially more appropriate classification schemes for gastric lymphomas. methods. fifty-one resected gastric lymphomas were reclassified according to the real classification, and the efficacy of multimodal treatment was examined retrospectively. the principal treatment plan consisted of: (1) surgical resection of the stomach with lymph node dissection, followed by (2) systemic chemotherapy, mainly using the cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (chop) regimen. results. according to the ann arbor classification, 27 patients had stage ie, 19 had stage iie, and 5 had stage iv nhl. using the real classification, we diagnosed diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbl) in 23 patients, marginal zone b-cell (low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [malt]-type) lymphoma",outcome non hodgkin lymphoma stomach gastrectomy clinicopathologic reclassification accord revise european american lymphoma classification best non hodgkin lymphoma nhl stomach still uncertain revised european american lymphoma real classification help define new potentially appropriate classification scheme gastric lymphoma method fifty one resect gastric lymphoma reclassify accord real classification efficacy multimodal examine retrospectively principal plan consist surgical resection stomach lymph node dissection follow systemic chemotherapy mainly use cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone chop regimen result accord ann arbor classification stage ie stage iie stage iv nhl use real classification diagnose diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbl marginal zone b cell low grade mucosa associate lymphoid tissue malt type lymphoma,d,Stomach Cancer
"Function-Preserving Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer The number of early gastric cancer (EGC) cases has been increasing because of improved diagnostic procedures. Applications of function-preserving gastric cancer surgery may therefore also be increasing because of its low incidence of lymph node metastasis, excellent survival rates, and the possibility of less-invasive procedures such as laparoscopic gastrectomy being used in combination. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) with radical lymph node dissection is one such function-preserving procedure that has been applied for EGC, with the indications, limitations, and survival benefits of PPG already reported in several retrospective studies. Laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy has also been applied for EGC of the upper third of the stomach, although this procedure can be associated with the 2 major problems of reflux esophagitis and carcinoma arising in the gastric stump. In the patient with EGC in the upper third of the stomach, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with a preserved very small stomach may provide a better quality of life for the patients and fewer postoperative complications. Finally, the laparoscopy endoscopy cooperative surgery procedure combines endoscopic submucosal dissection with laparoscopic gastric wall resection, which prevents excessive resection and deformation of the stomach after surgery and was recently applied for EGC cases without possibility of lymph node metastasis. Function-preserving laparoscopic gastrectomy is recommended for the treatment of EGC if the indication followed by accurate diagnosis is strictly confirmed. Preservation of remnant stomach sometimes causes severe postoperative dysfunctions such as delayed gastric retention in PPG, esophageal reflux in PG, and gastric stump carcinoma in the remnant stomach. Moreover, these techniques present technical difficulties to the surgeon. Although many retrospective studies showed the functional benefit or oncological safety of function-preserving gastrectomy, further prospective studies using large case series are necessary.","function-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer the number of early gastric cancer (egc) cases has been increasing because of improved diagnostic procedures. applications of function-preserving gastric cancer surgery may therefore also be increasing because of its low incidence of lymph node metastasis, excellent survival rates, and the possibility of less-invasive procedures such as laparoscopic gastrectomy being used in combination. pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (ppg) with radical lymph node dissection is one such function-preserving procedure that has been applied for egc, with the indications, limitations, and survival benefits of ppg already reported in several retrospective studies. laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy has also been applied for egc of the upper third of the stomach, although this procedure can be associated with the 2 major problems of reflux esophagitis and carcinoma arising in the gastric stump. in the patient with egc in the upper third of the stomach, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with a preserved very small",function preserve gastrectomy early gastric number early gastric egc increase improved diagnostic procedure application function preserve gastric surgery may therefore also increase low incidence lymph node metastasis excellent survival rate possibility less invasive procedure laparoscopic gastrectomy use combination pylorus preserve gastrectomy ppg radical lymph node dissection one function preserve procedure apply egc indication limitation survival benefit ppg already report several retrospective laparoscopy assist proximal gastrectomy also apply egc upper third stomach although procedure associate major problem reflux esophagitis carcinoma arising gastric stump egc upper third stomach laparoscopy assist subtotal gastrectomy preserved small,d,Stomach Cancer

"SCDb: an integrated database of stomach cancer Stomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC. SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. Moreover, gene_disease (OMIM and GAD databases), copy number variation (CNV, DGV database), methylation (PubMeth database), drug (WebGestalt database), and transcription factor (TF, TRANSFAC database) analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 9990 SC-related genes (including 8347 up-regulated genes and 1643 down-regulated genes) were identified, among which, 65 genes were further confirmed as SC-related genes by performing enrichment analysis. Besides this, 457 miRNAs, 20 SC-related miRNAs, 1570 SNPs, 108 SC-related SNPs, 419 TFs, 44,605 CNVs, 3404 drug-associated genes, 63 genes with methylation, and KM survival curves of 20,264 genes were obtained. By integrating these datasets, an integrated database of stomach cancer, designated as SCDb, (available at http://www.stomachcancerdb.org/) was established. As a comprehensive resource for human SC, SCDb database will be very useful for performing SC-related research in future, and will thus promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of SC.","scdb: an integrated database of stomach cancer stomach cancer (sc) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. as there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed sc cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of sc. sc-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. using the rna-seq, mirna-seq and clinical data downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (tcga), the kaplan-meier (km) survival curves for all the sc-related genes were generated and analyzed. the mirnas (miranda, mirtarget2, pictar, pita and targetscan databases), sc-related mirnas (hmdd and mir2disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps, dbsnp database), and sc-related snps (clinvar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. moreover, gene_disease (omim and gad databases), copy number variation",scdb integrated database stomach stomach sc type derive stomach mucous membrane non specific symptom noticeable symptom observe early stage newly diagnose sc usually reach advanced stage thus difficult cure therefore develop integrated database sc sc relate gene identify literature mining analyze publicly available microarray datasets use rna seq mirna seq data download genome atlas tcga kaplan meier km survival curve sc relate gene generate analyze mirnas miranda mirtarget pictar pita targetscan database sc relate mirnas hmdd mir databases single nucleotide polymorphisms snp dbsnp database sc relate snps clinvar database also retrieve indicated database moreover gene omim gad database copy number variation,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cellular and molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma and precursor lesions: A critical review. The cellular and molecular pathology of gastric cancer and its precursors are reviewed and discussed. Gastric carcinogenesis is a multistep phenomenon, beginning with precancerous conditions. Among these, adenoma is a direct precursor, because of the dysplastic nature of its cells. However, gastric adenoma is relatively rare. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is the most common precancerous condition, in which intestinal metaplasia often occurs. Carcinoma develops in CAG through stages of hyperplasia and dysplasia involving both metaplastic and non-metaplastic glands. Molecular alterations, including replication error and p53 and APC gene mutation and aneuploidy have been found in some of these conditions, confirming their role in carcinogenesis. Carcinomas of the stomach are heterogeneous in cellular composition. Both intestinal and gastric types of cells are found in all types of tumors, indicating the unique characteristics of gastric cancer. Many molecular lesions have been found in gastric carcinomas. Basic changes involve replication errors, telomerase activity, and aberrant CD44 transcripts. Many other changes often show differences in the frequency of their occurrence between the two major histological types of gastric carcinoma: well differentiated versus poorly differentiated, or intestinal type versus diffuse type. The timing and frequency of these changes in the stomach differ from the timing and frequency in colonic carcinogeneis. Pathological evaluation remains reliable and meaningful, in basic research as well as clinical management. To obtain correlation with molecular alterations, the need for detailed pathologic classification of gastric carcinoma is recognized, taking into account its biologic behavior and grades of cell differentiation.The cellular and molecular pathology of gastric cancer and its precursors are reviewed and discussed.

"Salt intake, cured meat consumption, refrigerator use and stomach cancer incidence: a prospective cohort study (Netherlands) Objective: Many case-control studies have reported that salt and cured meat intake are positively, and refrigerator use is inversely, associated with stomach cancer risk. In the current prospective study these associations were evaluated. Methods: The Netherlands Cohort Study consisted of 120,852 men and women ages 55-69 years at baseline in 1986. Salt exposure was measured by calculating mean daily sodium intake (dietary salt) from 150 food items and by specific salt questions. After 6.3 years of follow-up, 282 incident stomach cancer cases were available for analyses. Case-cohort analyses were based on the 282 cases and 3123 subcohort members. Results: In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, stomach disorders, history of stomach cancer in the family, rate ratios (RR) for increasing quintiles of energy-adjusted intake of dietary salt were 1.00, 1.49, 1.03, 1.54 and 1.18, respectively (p trend = 0.43). An inverse association was found between stomach cancer and salt added at the hot meal (p trend = 0.04). For salt added to home-made soup, use of salt at the table, salt preference and duration of refrigerator use, no associations were observed. Positive associations were found for bacon (RR highest/lowest intake = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.03-1.71) and other sliced cold meat (RR highest/lowest intake = 1.29; 95% CI = 0.96-1.72), but not for smoked sausage, total cold meats, rashers/bacon, boiled ham and smoked beef/pork loin roll. Separate analyses among subjects with self-reported stomach disorders revealed higher RR of stomach cancer for dietary salt and several types of cured meat. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that intake of dietary salt and several types of cured meat were weakly positively associated with stomach cancer risk.","salt intake, cured meat consumption, refrigerator use and stomach cancer incidence: a prospective cohort study (netherlands) objective: many case-control studies have reported that salt and cured meat intake are positively, and refrigerator use is inversely, associated with stomach cancer risk. in the current prospective study these associations were evaluated. methods: the netherlands cohort study consisted of 120,852 men and women ages 55-69 years at baseline in 1986. salt exposure was measured by calculating mean daily sodium intake (dietary salt) from 150 food items and by specific salt questions. after 6.3 years of follow-up, 282 incident stomach cancer cases were available for analyses. case-cohort analyses were based on the 282 cases and 3123 subcohort members. results: in multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, stomach disorders, history of stomach cancer in the family, rate ratios (rr) for increasing quintiles of energy-adjusted intake of dietary salt were 1.00, 1.49, 1.03, 1.54",salt intake cured meat consumption refrigerator use stomach incidence prospective cohort netherlands many control report salt cure meat intake positively refrigerator use inversely associate stomach risk current prospective association evaluate method netherlands cohort consist men woman age year baseline salt exposure measure calculate mean daily sodium intake dietary salt food item specific salt question year follow incident stomach available cohort base subcohort member result multivariate adjust age sex smoke education stomach disorder history stomach family rate ratio rr increase quintiles energy adjust intake dietary salt,d,Stomach Cancer
"To resect or not resect in metastatic gastric cancer: that is the question! Last week we discussed 5 patients with gastric cancer at a meeting of our interdisciplinary tumor board. With the evidence we have and the recent publication of multidisciplinary treatment guidelines [1, 2] most decisions were easy to take and we achieved a great consensus with our colleagues from surgery and radiation oncology about our treatment standards. But one case concerned us a lot and we do not know yet if we took the right decision. A 46-year old man, born in Russia who had emigrated to Germany as a child–a freelance carpenter and father of 2 children– presented 5 months ago with a swollen painless lymph node at the right side of the neck. Histopathologic assessment revealed an adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type. Further examination showed a distal stomach cancer infiltrating the duodenum, two borderline enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and several enlarged lymph nodes along the aorta from the diaphragm down to the iliac bifurcation. These nodes were all positive on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We treated this patient with docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin [3]. He tolerated the treatment well but then he developed sensory neuropathy in the fingers and toes during the last cycle and complained about increasing taste disorder and about fatigue. The last computed tomography (CT) scan showed a good response in the lymph nodes. The mediastinum was normal and some enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum were no longer avid for FDG on the PET-CT. On endoscopy we still found a vital nonobstructing tumor in the distal stomach infiltrating the descending part of the duodenum.

"Employment as butcher and cancer risk in a record-linkage study from Sweden. Objective: To investigate the risk of cancer among butchers and other meat workers in a large record-linkage study from Sweden. ; Methods: The Swedish Cancer Environment Register III contains nationwide data on cancer incidence during 1971–1989 for all residents, by occupation and industry of employment as reported at the 1960 and 1970 censuses. We identified 25,049 men classified as butchers or meat workers at either census. We used as a comparison group the remaining part of the active male population, after exclusion of workers with direct contact with animals. ; Results: Butchers in the meat industry had a slight increase in the risk of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–1.3), which was due to an increased risk of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.7), stomach (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.7), larynx (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.6–3.4), and lung (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.9). The risk of stomach cancer was highest during the first 5 years of the study, and among butchers from urban areas. No temporal or geographic variations were seen for lung cancer risk, with elevations restricted to squamous cell carcinoma. An increased risk of stomach, laryngeal and lung cancers was present in butchers and meat workers outside the meat industry. There was no clear indication of an increased risk of other neoplasms. ; Conclusions: The increased risk of oral, laryngeal, lung and stomach cancers among Swedish butchers may be at least partly due to confounding by tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and other lifestyle factors. However, exposures in the meat industry (e.g., viruses, nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) may contribute the elevated cancer risks.","employment as butcher and cancer risk in a record-linkage study from sweden. objective: to investigate the risk of cancer among butchers and other meat workers in a large record-linkage study from sweden. ; methods: the swedish cancer environment register iii contains nationwide data on cancer incidence during 1971–1989 for all residents, by occupation and industry of employment as reported at the 1960 and 1970 censuses. we identified 25,049 men classified as butchers or meat workers at either census. we used as a comparison group the remaining part of the active male population, after exclusion of workers with direct contact with animals. ; results: butchers in the meat industry had a slight increase in the risk of cancer (relative risk [rr] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.0–1.3), which was due to an increased risk of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (rr 1.6, 95% ci 1.0–2.7), stomach (rr 1.6, 95%",employment butcher risk record linkage sweden investigate risk among butcher meat worker large record linkage sweden method swedish environment register iii contain nationwide data incidence resident occupation industry employment report census identify men classify butcher meat worker either census use comparison group remain part active male population exclusion worker direct contact animal result butcher meat industry slight increase risk relative risk rr confidence interval ci due increase risk oral cavity pharynx rr ci stomach rr,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer-directed surgery for localized disease: decreased use in the elderly. Background: Previous studies report underuse of radiation and chemotherapy in the elderly, yet few have examined the rates of use (or underuse) of surgery. Using national data, we examined rates of surgical resection for patients with local-stage cancers. Methods: By using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988–1997), patients (≧40 years) were identified with localized adenocarcinoma of the breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, or rectum; non–small-cell lung carcinoma; and sarcoma (n = 200,360). Rates of cancer-directed surgery (CDS) were compared across age groups (at 5-year intervals). Multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of CDS in each tumor group. Results: Rates of CDS declined steadily with increasing age for all nine localized tumors. Most striking were the low rates of CDS for patients >70 years with esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and lung cancers (range, 0%–83%). However, CDS rates were >90% for breast and colon and >84% for rectal cancer in all age groups. Multivariate regression found lower odds of CDS for elderly patients for all cancers except colon. For example, age significantly decreased the odds of receiving CDS beginning at 60 years for lung cancer (odds ratio [OR], .550; P = .03), at 70 years for liver cancer (OR, .109; P = .003), and at 80 years for pancreatic cancer (OR, .120; P < .05). Conclusions: Although CDS for localized disease is being performed regularly in the elderly for some cancers (e.g. breast, colon, and rectum), this analysis shows that elderly patients are not receiving surgery for many potentially curable cancers. Whether these rates are appropriate or too low requires further evaluation. This is particularly essential because our population is aging.","cancer-directed surgery for localized disease: decreased use in the elderly. background: previous studies report underuse of radiation and chemotherapy in the elderly, yet few have examined the rates of use (or underuse) of surgery. using national data, we examined rates of surgical resection for patients with local-stage cancers. methods: by using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database (1988–1997), patients (≧40 years) were identified with localized adenocarcinoma of the breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, or rectum; non–small-cell lung carcinoma; and sarcoma (n = 200,360). rates of cancer-directed surgery (cds) were compared across age groups (at 5-year intervals). multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of cds in each tumor group. results: rates of cds declined steadily with increasing age for all nine localized tumors. most striking were the low rates of cds for patients >70 years with esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and lung cancers (range, 0%–83%). however, cds rates",direct surgery localized decrease use elderly previous report underuse radiation chemotherapy elderly yet examine rate use underuse surgery use national data examine rate surgical resection local stage method use surveillance epidemiology end result database year identify localized adenocarcinoma breast esophagus stomach pancreas colon rectum non small cell lung carcinoma sarcoma n rate direct surgery cd compare across age group year interval multivariate regression use identify predictor receipt cd group result rate cd decline steadily increase age nine localize striking low rate cd year esophagus stomach pancreas lung range however cd rate,d,Stomach Cancer
"The risk of second malignancy after adjuvant chemotherapy for stomach cancer. BACKGROUND: Although many trials have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for patients with stomach cancer, the benefits of ACT remain unclear. Moreover, some authors have reported that ACT increased the incidence of second malignancy. The risk of second malignancy was evaluated in patients who underwent treatment for stomach cancer in the past 20 years at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.METHODS: The study population consisted of 1925 patients who underwent gastrectomies for stomach cancer between the years 1978 and 1992 and who received follow-up examinations to check for second malignancies. They included 1114 patients who underwent surgery only (group A) and 811 who underwent surgery and received chemotherapy (group B). The observed incidence of second malignancy (O) was compared with the expected incidence (E), calculated by the person-year method, using data from the Cancer Registry in Osaka.RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 7.99 years. The total number of patients with a second malignancy was 127 (men, 97; women, 30); 72 patients had the second malignancy in digestive organs; 27 in respiratory organs; and 28 in other organs. The relative risks of a second malignancy in group A and B patients were 1.05 and 1.02 (differences between the two groups were not significant). The relative risks of a second malignancy in patients who received ACT with 5-fluorouracil, Tegafur and Uracil, and FT207 were 0.79, 1.01, and 1.06, respectively (differences between the groups were not significant).CONCLUSION: The risk of second malignancy after chemotherapy for stomach cancer was not high in comparison with the expected incidence. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not increase the risk of a second malignancy.","the risk of second malignancy after adjuvant chemotherapy for stomach cancer. background: although many trials have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy (act) for patients with stomach cancer, the benefits of act remain unclear. moreover, some authors have reported that act increased the incidence of second malignancy. the risk of second malignancy was evaluated in patients who underwent treatment for stomach cancer in the past 20 years at osaka medical center for cancer and cardiovascular diseases.methods: the study population consisted of 1925 patients who underwent gastrectomies for stomach cancer between the years 1978 and 1992 and who received follow-up examinations to check for second malignancies. they included 1114 patients who underwent surgery only (group a) and 811 who underwent surgery and received chemotherapy (group b). the observed incidence of second malignancy (o) was compared with the expected incidence (e), calculated by the person-year method, using",risk second malignancy adjuvant chemotherapy stomach although many trial conduct evaluate feasibility effectiveness adjuvant chemotherapy act stomach benefit act remain unclear moreover report act increase incidence second malignancy risk second malignancy evaluate undergo stomach past year osaka medical center cardiovascular population consist underwent gastrectomy stomach year receive follow examination check second malignancy include undergo surgery group underwent surgery receive chemotherapy group b observed incidence second malignancy compare expected incidence e calculate person year method use,d,Stomach Cancer
"Incidence and mortality rates of selected infection-related cancers in Puerto Rico and in the United States Background: In 2002, 17.8% of the global cancer burden was attributable to infections. This study assessed the agestandardized incidence and mortality rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) for the period 19922003 and compared them to those of Hispanics (USH), non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) in the United States (US). Methods: Age-standardized rates [ASR(World)] were calculated based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the PR Cancer Central Registry and SEER, using the direct method and the world population as the standard. Annual percent changes (APC) were calculated using the Poisson regression model from 1992-2003. Results: The incidence and mortality rates from stomach, liver and cervical cancer were lower in NHW than PR; with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer which was similar in both populations. Meanwhile, the incidence rates of stomach, liver and cervical cancers were similar between NHB and PR; except for NHB women who had a lower incidence rate of liver cancer than women in PR. NHB had a lower mortality from liver cancer than persons in PR, and similar mortality from stomach cancer. Conclusions: The burden of liver, stomach, and cervical cancer in PR compares to that of USH and NHB and continues to be a public health priority. Public health efforts are necessary to further decrease the burden of cancers associated to infections in these groups, the largest minority population groups in the US. Future studies need to identify factors that may prevent infections with cancer-related agents in these populations. Strategies to increase the use of preventive strategies, such as vaccination and screening, among minority populations should also be developed.","incidence and mortality rates of selected infection-related cancers in puerto rico and in the united states background: in 2002, 17.8% of the global cancer burden was attributable to infections. this study assessed the agestandardized incidence and mortality rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancer in puerto rico (pr) for the period 19922003 and compared them to those of hispanics (ush), non-hispanic whites (nhw), and non-hispanic blacks (nhb) in the united states (us). methods: age-standardized rates [asr(world)] were calculated based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the pr cancer central registry and seer, using the direct method and the world population as the standard. annual percent changes (apc) were calculated using the poisson regression model from 1992-2003. results: the incidence and mortality rates from stomach, liver and cervical cancer were lower in nhw than pr; with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer which was similar in both populations. meanwhile,",incidence mortality rate select infection relate puerto rico united state global burden attributable infections assess agestandardized incidence mortality rate stomach liver cervical puerto rico pr period compare hispanic ush non hispanic white nhw non hispanic black nhb united state u method age standardize rate asr world calculate base incidence mortality data pr central registry seer use direct method world population standard annual percent change apc calculate use poisson regression model result incidence mortality rate stomach liver cervical low nhw pr exception mortality cervical similar population meanwhile,d,Stomach Cancer
"Machine learning-based approaches for cancer prediction using microbiome data. Emerging evidence of the relationship between the microbiome composition and the development of numerous diseases, including cancer, has led to an increasing interest in the study of the human microbiome. Technological breakthroughs regarding DNA sequencing methods propelled microbiome studies with a large number of samples, which called for the necessity of more sophisticated data-analytical tools to analyze this complex relationship. The aim of this work was to develop a machine learning-based approach to distinguish the type of cancer based on the analysis of the tissue-specific microbial information, assessing the human microbiome as valuable predictive information for cancer identification. For this purpose, Random Forest algorithms were trained for the classification of five types of cancer-head and neck, esophageal, stomach, colon, and rectum cancers-with samples provided by The Cancer Microbiome Atlas database. One versus all and multi-class classification studies were conducted to evaluate the discriminative capability of the microbial data across increasing levels of cancer site specificity, with results showing a progressive rise in difficulty for accurate sample classification. Random Forest models achieved promising performances when predicting head and neck, stomach, and colon cancer cases, with the latter returning accuracy scores above 90% across the different studies conducted. However, there was also an increased difficulty when discriminating esophageal and rectum cancers, failing to differentiate with adequate results rectum from colon cancer cases, and esophageal from head and neck and stomach cancers. These results point to the fact that anatomically adjacent cancers can be more complex to identify due to microbial similarities. Despite the limitations, microbiome data analysis using machine learning may advance novel strategies to improve cancer detection and prevention, and decrease disease burden.","machine learning-based approaches for cancer prediction using microbiome data. emerging evidence of the relationship between the microbiome composition and the development of numerous diseases, including cancer, has led to an increasing interest in the study of the human microbiome. technological breakthroughs regarding dna sequencing methods propelled microbiome studies with a large number of samples, which called for the necessity of more sophisticated data-analytical tools to analyze this complex relationship. the aim of this work was to develop a machine learning-based approach to distinguish the type of cancer based on the analysis of the tissue-specific microbial information, assessing the human microbiome as valuable predictive information for cancer identification. for this purpose, random forest algorithms were trained for the classification of five types of cancer-head and neck, esophageal, stomach, colon, and rectum cancers-with samples provided by the cancer microbiome atlas database. one versus all and multi-class classification studies were conducted to evaluate",machine learn base approach prediction use microbiome data emerge evidence relationship microbiome composition development numerous include lead increase interest human microbiome technological breakthrough regard dna sequence method propel microbiome large number sample call necessity sophisticated data analytical tool analyze complex relationship work develop machine learning base approach distinguish type base tissue specific microbial information assess human microbiome valuable predictive information identification random forest algorithm train classification five type head neck esophageal stomach colon rectum sample provide microbiome atlas database one versus multi class classification conduct evaluate,d,Stomach Cancer
"Mass-like Dieulafoy's lesion associated with advanced gastric cancer at the antrum of stomach: a case report and literature review. Dieulafoy’s lesion, also known as a caliber-persistent artery, is a shallow, small, and rare lesion that occurs along the lesser curvature of proximal stomach. It is rare for a Dieulafoy’s lesion to present as a mass-like lesion that coexists with gastric cancer. To our best knowledge, we report the first case and histopathological pictures of a mass-like Dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer in the antrum of the stomach. A 57-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of intermittent epigastric dull pain and dyspepsia. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a friable mass that was located between the distal antrum and the pyloric ring. Biopsy revealed it to be an intestinal type adenocarcinoma. Subtotal gastrectomy was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Grossly, a large irregular plaque-like tumor lesion was noted at the anterior wall of the distal antrum and pylorus ring near the lesser curvature, measuring 5.6 × 4.8 × 1.0 cm. Histopathological examination of the resected stomach revealed that the plaque-like lesion largely consisted of numerous abnormally large-caliber and tortuous arteries in the submucosa. The increased fibrosis of the submucosa resulted in the formation of elevated plaque. The intestinal type adenocarcinoma was noted to be largely confined to the mucosa layer, with focal submucosal and muscular propria involvement. The patient was discharged one week after the subtotal gastrectomy, and she was alive and well 17 months after discharge, with no major complications. This is the first case of a mass-like Dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer at the distal antrum area. This case highlights the possibility of life-threatening gastric bleeding after mucosal resection or biopsy that could be encountered by endoscopists.","mass-like dieulafoy's lesion associated with advanced gastric cancer at the antrum of stomach: a case report and literature review. dieulafoy’s lesion, also known as a caliber-persistent artery, is a shallow, small, and rare lesion that occurs along the lesser curvature of proximal stomach. it is rare for a dieulafoy’s lesion to present as a mass-like lesion that coexists with gastric cancer. to our best knowledge, we report the first case and histopathological pictures of a mass-like dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer in the antrum of the stomach. a 57-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of intermittent epigastric dull pain and dyspepsia. subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a friable mass that was located between the distal antrum and the pyloric ring. biopsy revealed it to be an intestinal type adenocarcinoma. subtotal gastrectomy was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. grossly, a large irregular plaque-like tumor lesion was noted at the",mass like dieulafoy lesion associate advanced gastric antrum stomach report literature review dieulafoy lesion also know caliber persistent artery shallow small rare lesion occur along less curvature proximal stomach rare dieulafoy lesion present mass like lesion coexist gastric best knowledge report first histopathological picture mass like dieulafoy lesion coexist advanced gastric antrum stomach year old female present month history intermittent epigastric dull pain dyspepsia subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveal friable mass locate distal antrum pyloric ring biopsy reveal intestinal type adenocarcinoma subtotal gastrectomy perform neoadjuvant chemotherapy grossly large irregular plaque like lesion note,d,Stomach Cancer
"Using a Chinese time trade-off approach to explore the health utility level and quality of life of cancer patients in urban China: a multicentre cross-sectional study A quality of life assessment is useful in identifying a specific health impact on patients who are suffering from various medical conditions. This study estimated the quality of life among patients with cancers of the lungs, breast, colorectum, oesophagus, liver, and stomach in urban China and evaluates the associated factors. This study employed a random cluster sampling strategy to recruit patients with lung, breast, colorectal, oesophageal, liver, or stomach cancer from eleven third-grade class-A (the highest level) hospitals in Beijing between October 2013 and May 2014. We performed a quality of life survey that included solicitation of sociodemographic and clinical information and the use of a EuroQoL five-dimension three-level questionnaire. We applied the Chinese time trade-off method to calculate the health utility values, which were transformed into binary variables (using the median as the cut-off). In addition, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with the quality of life. A total of 637 patients (91 with lung cancer, 152 with breast cancer, 60 with colorectal cancer, 108 with oesophageal cancer, 154 with liver cancer, and 72 with stomach cancer) were included in this study; the medians of the health utility values were 0.780, 0.800, 0.800, 0.860, 0.800, and 0.870, respectively. The most common concerns for patients of all six cancer types were pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The reported health status of patients was associated with various demographic and clinical variables. This study highlighted that pain relief and psychological support are important aspects of patient management for those with these types of cancer. Individuals with factors associated with a poorer quality of life should be targets for additional support.","using a chinese time trade-off approach to explore the health utility level and quality of life of cancer patients in urban china: a multicentre cross-sectional study a quality of life assessment is useful in identifying a specific health impact on patients who are suffering from various medical conditions. this study estimated the quality of life among patients with cancers of the lungs, breast, colorectum, oesophagus, liver, and stomach in urban china and evaluates the associated factors. this study employed a random cluster sampling strategy to recruit patients with lung, breast, colorectal, oesophageal, liver, or stomach cancer from eleven third-grade class-a (the highest level) hospitals in beijing between october 2013 and may 2014. we performed a quality of life survey that included solicitation of sociodemographic and clinical information and the use of a euroqol five-dimension three-level questionnaire. we applied the chinese time trade-off method to calculate the health utility values, which",use chinese time trade approach explore health utility level quality life urban china multicentre cross sectional quality life assessment useful identify specific health impact suffer various medical condition estimate quality life among lung breast colorectum oesophagus liver stomach urban china evaluate associated factor employ random cluster sample strategy recruit lung breast colorectal oesophageal liver stomach eleven third grade class high level hospital beijing october may perform quality life survey include solicitation sociodemographic information use euroqol five dimension three level questionnaire apply chinese time trade method calculate health utility value,d,Stomach Cancer
"Laparoscopic wedge resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach: initial experience. Surgery for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) of the stomach is now frequently performed using a laparoscopic approach. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of laparoscopy in the management of GIST of the stomach. We reviewed the records of 12 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for GIST between April 2000 and April 2004, and compared their short-term outcomes with those of patients who underwent open surgery. All laparoscopic wedge resections were done using stapling devices and 3–4 trocars, often with the aid of intraoperative gastroscopy. We examined all patients preoperatively using various diagnostic modalities, including endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). A laparoscopic approach was not indicated if the tumor was located near the cardia or pylorus or if it was ≧5 cm in diameter. A specific diagnosis of GIST was obtained preoperatively by EUS-FNA in 10 of the 12 patients. The median diameter of the lesion was 2.7 cm (range, 1.5–4.8 cm). Although intraoperative complications were encountered in two patients, conversion to open surgery was not required, and we were able to perform complete tumor excision with negative surgical margins in all patients. The median operative time was 100 min (range, 65–180 min), similar to that for open surgery. First flatus was passed earlier, and the interval to resuming oral intake was shorter than after open surgery. No major postoperative complications such as leakage developed, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range, 5–12 days). All diagnoses made by EUS-FNA were confirmed by immunohisto-pathological evaluation of resected specimens. Laparoscopic wedge resection is a feasible treatment option for GISTs of the stomach if the lesion is <5 cm in diameter.","laparoscopic wedge resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach: initial experience. surgery for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist) of the stomach is now frequently performed using a laparoscopic approach. we investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of laparoscopy in the management of gist of the stomach. we reviewed the records of 12 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for gist between april 2000 and april 2004, and compared their short-term outcomes with those of patients who underwent open surgery. all laparoscopic wedge resections were done using stapling devices and 3–4 trocars, often with the aid of intraoperative gastroscopy. we examined all patients preoperatively using various diagnostic modalities, including endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (eus-fna). a laparoscopic approach was not indicated if the tumor was located near the cardia or pylorus or if it was ≧5 cm in diameter. a specific diagnosis of gist was obtained preoperatively by eus-fna in 10 of the",laparoscopic wedge resection gastrointestinal stromal stomach initial experience surgery gastrointestinal stromal gist stomach frequently perform use laparoscopic approach investigate feasibility effectiveness laparoscopy management gist stomach review record consecutive undergo laparoscopic surgery gist april april compare short term outcome undergo open surgery laparoscopic wedge resection use staple device trocars often aid intraoperative gastroscopy examine preoperatively use various diagnostic modality include endoscopic ultrasonography guide fine needle aspiration eu fna laparoscopic approach indicate locate near cardia pylorus cm diameter specific diagnosis gist obtain preoperatively eus fna,d,Stomach Cancer
"Diagnosis of gastric cancer by MDCT gastrography: diagnostic characteristics and management potential Gastric cancer is regarded as the fifth most frequent tumor globally but the third most common fatal illness. As early as possible, we diagnose cancer stomach especially at early stages, the higher the rate of life. Nevertheless, most cases are diagnosed at late cases where surgery is not of the same benefit at early stages because of clinically indefinite symptoms. The prospective study goal is to estimate the role of MDCT in diagnosis and staging of cancer stomach. In our study, it was found that there was a high relationship between pathological and CT staging by using MPR. CT with MPR was specific and accurate in diagnosis of all stages of gastric cancer with specificity ranged between 93 and 97% and accuracy ranged between 90 and 92.5%. However, it showed lowest sensitivity in diagnosis of stage 1 of gastric cancer. On the other hand, it showed highest sensitivity (90%) in diagnosis of stage IV as well as we found that MPR and VR of MDCT are much more accurate (92.5%) than multi-detector computed tomography axial images (80%) in the diagnosis of all stages of gastric cancer with the difference between the two sequences was significant (P = 0.009). Our results demonstrate that preoperative MDCT with contrast filling technique for abdomen and pelvis evaluates the local disease process of gastric cancer as well as the potential areas of spread. This information is vital in choosing between palliative or radical surgery. MPR and VR help in the assessment of tumor extension and considered as a highly representative prognostic value.

"Green-tea consumption and risk of stomach cancer: a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China The effect of drinking Chinese green tea on the risk of stomach cancer was evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China, from October 1991 to December 1993. Eligible cases were incident cases of primary stomach cancer diagnosed during the study period among residents of Hongkou district and Nanhui county aged under 80 years. Controls were selected from the same street or commune where the case resided and were matched to the cases on age (within three years) and gender. A total of 711 cases and 711 matched controls, more than 90 percent of the eligible subjects, completed the interview. Information was obtained on the types of tea used, age when habitual tea drinking started, frequency of new batches of tea leaves used per day, number of cups brewed from each batch, total duration of drinking for each batch, strength and temperature of the tea consumed. Statistical analysis was based on modelling through conditional logistic regression. After adjusting for age, gender, place of residence, education, birthplace, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking, the odds ratio (OR) comparing drinkers of green tea with nondrinkers was 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.54–0.93). The adjusted OR decreased with increasing number of new batches of the green tea consumed each day (P value trend = 0.006). With the largest series of stomach cancer cases to date, this study found green-tea consumption associated with lower risk of stomach cancer. Among drinkers of green tea, the risk of stomach cancer did not depend on the age when habitual green-tea drinking started. Green tea may disrupt gastric carcinogenesis at both the intermediate and the late stages.","green-tea consumption and risk of stomach cancer: a population-based case-control study in shanghai, china the effect of drinking chinese green tea on the risk of stomach cancer was evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in shanghai, china, from october 1991 to december 1993. eligible cases were incident cases of primary stomach cancer diagnosed during the study period among residents of hongkou district and nanhui county aged under 80 years. controls were selected from the same street or commune where the case resided and were matched to the cases on age (within three years) and gender. a total of 711 cases and 711 matched controls, more than 90 percent of the eligible subjects, completed the interview. information was obtained on the types of tea used, age when habitual tea drinking started, frequency of new batches of tea leaves used per day, number of cups brewed from each batch, total duration",green tea consumption risk stomach population base control shanghai china effect drink chinese green tea risk stomach evaluate population base control conduct shanghai china october december eligible incident primary stomach diagnose period among resident hongkou district nanhui county age year control select street commune reside match age within three year gender total match control percent eligible subject complete interview information obtain type tea use age habitual tea drinking start frequency new batch tea leaf use per day number cup brew batch total duration,d,Stomach Cancer
"Redefining early gastric cancer. The problem is that current definitions of early gastric cancer allow the inclusion of regional lymph node metastases. The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. The aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in “early gastric cancer” to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. A systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library) was undertaken using a combination of text words “early gastric cancer”, “lymph node metastasis”, “factors”, “endoscopy”, “surgery”, “lymphadenectomy” “mucosa”, “submucosa”, “lymphovascular invasion”, “differentiated”, “undifferentiated” and “ulcer”. All available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. The initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Over time, the definition of early gastric cancer has broadened and the indications for endoscopic treatment have widened. The mean frequency of lymph node metastases increased on the basis of depth of infiltration (mucosa 6 % vs. submucosa 28 %), presence of lymphovascular invasion (absence 9 % vs. presence 53 %), tumour differentiation (differentiated 13 % vs. undifferentiated 34 %) and macroscopic type (elevated 13 % vs. flat 26 %) and tumour diameter (≤2 cm 8 % vs. >2 cm 25 %). There is a need to re-examine the diagnosis and staging of early gastric cancer to ensure that patients with one or more identifiable risk factor for lymph node metastases are not denied appropriate chemotherapy and surgical resection.","redefining early gastric cancer. the problem is that current definitions of early gastric cancer allow the inclusion of regional lymph node metastases. the increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. the aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in “early gastric cancer” to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. a systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (medline, embase, pubmed and the cochrane library) was undertaken using a combination of text words “early gastric cancer”, “lymph node metastasis”, “factors”, “endoscopy”, “surgery”, “lymphadenectomy” “mucosa”, “submucosa”, “lymphovascular invasion”, “differentiated”, “undifferentiated” and “ulcer”. all available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. the initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies",redefine early gastric problem current definition early gastric allow inclusion regional lymph node metastases increase use endoscopic submucosal dissection treat early gastric concern regional lymph node address thus critically evaluate current evidence regard specific factor associate lymph node metastasis early gastric develop precise definition improve management systematic comprehensive search major reference database medline embase cochrane library undertake use combination text word early gastric lymph node metastasis factor endoscopy surgery lymphadenectomy mucosa submucosa lymphovascular invasion differentiate undifferentiated ulcer available publication describe related factor associate lymph node metastasis early gastric include initial search yield,d,Stomach Cancer

"Endoscopic submucosal dissection for early neoplastic lesions in the surgically altered stomach: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer is highly effective and well established. Performing ESD in the surgically altered stomach (SAS) is challenging. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the safety and efficacy of ESD for patients with early neoplastic lesions occurring in the SAS with a subgroup analysis of lesions occurring on the suture line compared to non-suture line lesions and outcomes in the remnant stomach compared to the gastric tube. We performed a literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL electronic databases from January 2000 to November 2017 for articles reporting the safety and efficacy of ESD in the surgically altered stomach. SAS was defined as the remnant stomach following gastrectomy and gastric tube following esophagectomy. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3 software. A total of 21 articles, with 903 lesions occurring in the remnant stomach or gastric tube, were included in this study. There was no significant difference between en bloc (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91–1.08), curative resection (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84–1.26), or bleeding rates (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.18–10.72) between lesions in the remnant stomach and gastric tube. However, perforation was significantly higher in the gastric tube (RR 5.19, 95% 1.27–21.25). Suture line lesions had a significantly higher risk of perforation (RR 4.55, 95% CI 2.13–9.74). ESD for early neoplastic lesions occurring in the SAS is a safe and efficacious with similar en bloc and curative resection rates compared to the anatomically normal stomach. ESD for lesions on the suture line or in the gastric tube is associated with an increased risk of perforation which can be managed endoscopically.","endoscopic submucosal dissection for early neoplastic lesions in the surgically altered stomach: a systematic review and meta-analysis. endoscopic submucosal dissection (esd) for early gastric cancer is highly effective and well established. performing esd in the surgically altered stomach (sas) is challenging. the aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the safety and efficacy of esd for patients with early neoplastic lesions occurring in the sas with a subgroup analysis of lesions occurring on the suture line compared to non-suture line lesions and outcomes in the remnant stomach compared to the gastric tube. we performed a literature search of the pubmed, embase, and cinahl electronic databases from january 2000 to november 2017 for articles reporting the safety and efficacy of esd in the surgically altered stomach. sas was defined as the remnant stomach following gastrectomy and gastric tube following esophagectomy. meta-analysis was performed using review manager version 5.3 software. a total",endoscopic submucosal dissection early neoplastic lesion surgically alter stomach systematic review meta endoscopic submucosal dissection esd early gastric highly effective well establish perform esd surgically altered stomach sa challenge meta assess safety efficacy esd early neoplastic lesion occur sa subgroup lesion occur suture line compare non suture line lesion outcome remnant stomach compare gastric tube perform literature search embase cinahl electronic database january november article report safety efficacy esd surgically altered stomach sa define remnant stomach follow gastrectomy gastric tube follow esophagectomy meta perform use review manager version software total,d,Stomach Cancer
"A resected case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach with unusual lymph node metastasis Gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is a relatively rare tumor. We experienced a case of early gastric cancer in which an endocrine cell carcinoma was identified within a differentiated adenocarcinoma, and a component of this endocrine cell carcinoma had metastasized to lymph nodes of the stomach. In its 2010 revision regarding digestive system tumors, WHO classified cancer cells with characteristics of both glandular system cells and neuroendocrine cells as mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) under the neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) category. In this case, we observed an endocrine cell carcinoma continuous with an intramucosal differentiated adenocarcinoma, and cancer cells with an irregular gland duct structure were observed in the proliferative portion of the submucosal tissue. In addition, there was a 35 mm size lymph node metastasis in the lesser curvature of the stomach consisting entirely of poorly differentiated cancer cells with polymorphic, highly atypical nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistological analysis showed that the endocrine carcinoma in the gastric mucosa was chromogranin A positive and the infiltrated area of the submucosal tissue was also chromogranin A positive. The lymph node metastasis was positive not only for chromogranin A, but also for Synaptophysin and CD56. Furthermore, the Ki67 labeling index was high at approximately 80 % for the gastric endocrine cell carcinoma and approximately 90 % for the lymph node metastases. Until now, there are no reports related to the patients with early gastric cancer accompanied with lymph node metastasis of MANEC. This case is very interested in considering the mechanism of lymph node metastasis of MANEC. The patient has shown no sign of recurrence for 1 year and 4 months after postoperative chemotherapy.","a resected case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach with unusual lymph node metastasis gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is a relatively rare tumor. we experienced a case of early gastric cancer in which an endocrine cell carcinoma was identified within a differentiated adenocarcinoma, and a component of this endocrine cell carcinoma had metastasized to lymph nodes of the stomach. in its 2010 revision regarding digestive system tumors, who classified cancer cells with characteristics of both glandular system cells and neuroendocrine cells as mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma (manec) under the neuroendocrine carcinoma (nec) category. in this case, we observed an endocrine cell carcinoma continuous with an intramucosal differentiated adenocarcinoma, and cancer cells with an irregular gland duct structure were observed in the proliferative portion of the submucosal tissue. in addition, there was a 35 mm size lymph node metastasis in the lesser curvature of the stomach consisting entirely of poorly differentiated",resected neuroendocrine carcinoma stomach unusual lymph node metastasis gastric endocrine cell carcinoma relatively rare experience early gastric endocrine cell carcinoma identify within differentiated adenocarcinoma component endocrine cell carcinoma metastasize lymph node stomach revision regard digestive system classify cell characteristic glandular system cell neuroendocrine cell mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma manec neuroendocrine carcinoma nec category observe endocrine cell carcinoma continuous intramucosal differentiate adenocarcinoma cell irregular gland duct structure observe proliferative portion submucosal tissue addition mm size lymph node metastasis less curvature stomach consist entirely poorly differentiate,d,Stomach Cancer
"4. Cancers attributable to dietary factors in the UK in 2010: I. Low consumption of fruit and vegetables There is considerable controversy over the protective effect of diets rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre, and the respective roles of the different components (including micronutrients such as folate). The report of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Nutrition Policy (COMA) (Department of Health, 1998) recommended increasing consumption of all of them, an advice that seems to have motivated the Department of Health in promoting its ‘5-a-day’ programme (Department of Health, 2005). The original consensus of the probable decrease in risk of several cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and colorectum) associated with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (WHO/FAO, 2003) was based on the results of multiple case–control studies and a few prospective studies. The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention (IARC, 2003) concludes its review of the evidence as follows: There is limited evidence for cancer-preventive effect of consumption of fruit and vegetables for cancers of the mouth and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, larynx, lung, ovary (vegetables only), bladder (fruit only) and kidney.; There is inadequate evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of consumption of fruit and vegetables for all other sites.; More specifically, this evidence indicates that higher intake of fruit probably lowers the risk of cancers of the oesophagus, stomach and lung, while higher intake of vegetables probably lowers the risk of cancers of the oesophagus and colorectum.; Likewise a higher intake of fruit possibly lowers the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, colorectum, larynx, kidney and urinary bladder. An increase in consumption of vegetables possibly reduces the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, stomach, larynx, lung, ovary and kidney.","4. cancers attributable to dietary factors in the uk in 2010: i. low consumption of fruit and vegetables there is considerable controversy over the protective effect of diets rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre, and the respective roles of the different components (including micronutrients such as folate). the report of the committee on medical aspects of food nutrition policy (coma) (department of health, 1998) recommended increasing consumption of all of them, an advice that seems to have motivated the department of health in promoting its ‘5-a-day’ programme (department of health, 2005). the original consensus of the probable decrease in risk of several cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and colorectum) associated with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (who/fao, 2003) was based on the results of multiple case–control studies and a few prospective studies. the iarc handbook of cancer prevention (iarc, 2003) concludes its review",attributable dietary factor uk low consumption fruit vegetable considerable controversy protective effect diet rich fruit vegetable fibre respective role different component include micronutrient folate report committee medical aspect food nutrition policy coma department health recommend increase consumption advice seem motivate department health promote day programme department health original consensus probable decrease risk several gastrointestinal tract oral cavity pharynx oesophagus stomach colorectum associate increased consumption fruit vegetable fao base result multiple control prospective iarc handbook prevention iarc conclude review,d,Stomach Cancer

A fifty-nine-year-old asthenic male (already treated case of metachronous colorectal cancer in 2008 and 2011) presented with complaints of generalized weakness and fatigue. Strong family history was present with two of his first-degree relatives having diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer at the age < 50 years with one of them having stomach carcinoma and another with GEJ tumors. On evaluation, upper GI endoscopy revealed growth at cardia and endoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Radiological evaluation with PET-CT scan revealed proximal stomach growth with regional lymphadenopathy. Patient was optimized for surgery and underwent D2 total gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with Roux-en-Y oesophago-jejunal anastomosis. Pathological stage revealed pT4N2M0, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of proximal stomach, both distal and proximal cut margins negative for tumor, LVI present with no perineural invasion, and 5/18 lymph nodes dissected were positive for malignancy. Genetic testing needs to be considered in this patient (modified Bethesda guidelines and IGCLC criteria). Familial gastric cancer are of two types: (a) hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome, (b) familial intestinal type gastric cancer. Approximately 5% of patients have germ-line mutations—AD LYNCH syndrome, hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, and polyposis and non-polyposis syndrome. Once diagnosed in localized advanced stage, the best treatment is R0 resection though overall prognosis in these patients is very poor. So it is rationale to find such families with elevated risk and to do active surveillance for early diagnosis and providing prophylactic gastrectomies to them as it has proven to be beneficial in hereditary form of gastric cancer.","multiple gastrointestinal cancers in a single patient—a rare clinical entity multiple gastrointestinal cancers in a single patient is a rare entity. in our study, we are showing the clinical presentation and management of these patients. a fifty-nine-year-old asthenic male (already treated case of metachronous colorectal cancer in 2008 and 2011) presented with complaints of generalized weakness and fatigue. strong family history was present with two of his first-degree relatives having diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer at the age < 50 years with one of them having stomach carcinoma and another with gej tumors. on evaluation, upper gi endoscopy revealed growth at cardia and endoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. radiological evaluation with pet-ct scan revealed proximal stomach growth with regional lymphadenopathy. patient was optimized for surgery and underwent d2 total gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with roux-en-y oesophago-jejunal anastomosis. pathological stage revealed pt4n2m0, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of proximal stomach, both distal and proximal",multiple gastrointestinal single rare entity multiple gastrointestinal single rare entity show presentation management fifty nine year old asthenic male already treated metachronous colorectal present complaint generalized weakness fatigue strong family history present two first degree relative diagnose gastrointestinal age year one stomach carcinoma another gej evaluation upper gi endoscopy reveal growth cardia endoscopic biopsy reveal adenocarcinoma radiological evaluation pet ct scan reveal proximal stomach growth regional lymphadenopathy optimize surgery underwent total gastrectomy distal pancreatectomy splenectomy roux en oesophago jejunal anastomosis pathological stage reveal pt n moderately differentiate adenocarcinoma proximal stomach distal proximal,d,Stomach Cancer

"Metastasis to the lymph nodes along the proper hepatic artery from adenocarcinoma of the stomach The study sought the significance of resecting lymph nodes along the proper hepatic artery (station 12a) in gastric cancer surgery and the possibility of predicting station 12a involvement from clinicopathological factors or metastatic status in other regional lymph nodes of the stomach. Patients who underwent D2 gastrectomy were assessed retrospectively. Survivals were compared between the patients with and without station 12a metastasis among the patients with metastasis to any regional lymph nodes. Clinicopathological factors correlating with station 12a metastasis were sought by logistic regression analyses. The possibility of a predictor for station 12a metastasis was evaluated in each regional lymph node station. Metastasis to station 12a was observed in 21 of 1260 patients (1.7 %). The 5-year overall survival rate was 62.7 % in the patients without station 12a metastasis and 54.4 % in the patients with station 12a metastasis (P = 0.164).

"A Gastric Cancer Following Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition Surgery Gastric cancer is still a major cancer worldwide and more than one million cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed each year. It is known that stomach cancer is increasing, especially after surgical interventions to the stomach. Due to obesity and diabetes, the most common diseases of our age, obesity and metabolic surgery have been performed widely in recent years. Here in, It is aimed to report an interesting case of gastric cancer located on the stapler line in a short time after Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation. A 60-year-old male patient consulted to the general surgery outpatient clinic with complaints of intermittent epigastric pain and bloating. Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation was performed 3 years ago for morbid obesity and Type 2 diabetes. During endoscopy, a mucosal irregularity was detected in the gastric corpus. Histopathological examination of the biopsies revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma (signet ring cell type). Total gastrectomy was performed and the patient was discharged without any problem. We conducted a literature review of the studies published in English on PubMed, Medline and Google Scholarly databases on the development of cancer after Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation.

"Effects of the interleukin-1β-511 C/T gene polymorphism on the risk of gastric cancer in the context of the relationship between race and H. pylori infection: a meta-analysis of 20,000 subjects The interleukin (IL)-1β-511 C/T polymorphism has been shown to be functional and to contribute to the risk of gastric cancer. However, the relationship between the IL-1β-511 C/T polymorphism and gastric carcinogenesis remains inconclusive. A systematical electronic search was conducted of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases. A random and a fixed effects model were exploited to estimate summary odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out with respect to ethnicity, quality assessment scores, control sources, genotyping methods, cancer histopathology and location, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. A total of 45 studies containing 9,066 cases of gastric cancer and 11,192 control subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. The IL-1β-511 C/T polymorphism was found to enhance the risk of stomach cancer for overall and HWE-satisfying studies. Asians showed a positive relationship in both the overall and HWE-satisfying groups, whereas Caucasians did not. Based on subgroup analysis, H. pylori infection and genotype analysis using PCR–RFLP methods increase the association between IL-1β-511 T allele carrier and risk of stomach cancer. A positive relationship was found between the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP and stomach carcinoma susceptibility, and the results suggest that Asian ethnicity, H. pylori infection and methodologically, PCR–RFLP genotyping strengthen this relationship. Reflecting on prevalence of H. pylori in Asian countries, additional studies on the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP in the context of ethnicity and H. pylori infection may provide key insights into the mechanism underlying gastric cancer carcinogenesis. It was found PCR–RFLP is the most reliable genotyping method, and thus, it is recommendable to adopt it to determine the presence of the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP.","effects of the interleukin-1β-511 c/t gene polymorphism on the risk of gastric cancer in the context of the relationship between race and h. pylori infection: a meta-analysis of 20,000 subjects the interleukin (il)-1β-511 c/t polymorphism has been shown to be functional and to contribute to the risk of gastric cancer. however, the relationship between the il-1β-511 c/t polymorphism and gastric carcinogenesis remains inconclusive. a systematical electronic search was conducted of the medline, embase, and central databases. a random and a fixed effects model were exploited to estimate summary odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out with respect to ethnicity, quality assessment scores, control sources, genotyping methods, cancer histopathology and location, and helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection. a total of 45 studies containing 9,066 cases of gastric cancer and 11,192 control subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. the il-1β-511 c/t polymorphism was found to enhance",effect interleukin c gene polymorphism risk gastric context relationship race h pylori infection meta subject interleukin il c polymorphism show functional contribute risk gastric however relationship il c polymorphism gastric carcinogenesis remain inconclusive systematical electronic search conduct medline embase central database random fixed effect model exploit estimate summary odds ratio confidence interval subgroup sensitivity carry respect ethnicity quality assessment score control source genotyping method histopathology location helicobacter pylorus h pylori infection total contain gastric control subject satisfy inclusion criteria il c polymorphism find enhance,d,Stomach Cancer

"Cancer Mortality and Long-Term Environmental Exposure of Cadmium in Contaminated Community Based on a Third Retrospective Cause of Death Investigation of Residents Living in the Guangdong Province from 2004 to 2005. This study compared the temporal and geographic trends of cancer in China with a specific focus on the long-term exposure to soil cadmium (Cd) pollution. The geographic information system (GIS; kriging interpolation method) was used to detect the Cd contained in the soil from the Dabaoshan area, Guangdong Province. The standard rate ratio (SRR) was calculated to describe the relationship between Cd exposure and cancer mortality risk using the low-exposure group as a reference. Eight hundred six cancer deaths (533 male and 273 female) in the total population of 972,970 were identified, and the age-standardized rate (world) was 145.64 per 100,000. Significant dose-response relationships were found using the low-exposure group as the reference group. The Cd soil levels were positively associated with the cancer mortality risk in the community population, particularly for all cancers (SRR = 3.27; 95% CI = 2.42–4.55), esophageal cancer (SRR = 5.42; 95% CI = 1.07–30.56), stomach cancer (SRR = 5.99; 95% CI = 2.00–18.66), liver cancer (SRR = 4.45; 95% CI = 2.16–10.34), and lung cancer (SRR = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.62–5.31) for the total population. Additionally, similar results were obtained when using the 2000 China standard population. Cd exposure significantly affected the standardized mortality rates (China) by age group for all cancers, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer in the total population, particularly in the age groups of 35–54, 55–74, and ≥ 75 years, respectively.

"Trends in oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancer mortality rates in Spain, 1952–2006: an age-period-cohort analysis Although oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancers share some risk factors, no comparative analysis of mortality rate trends in these illnesses has been undertaken in Spain. This study aimed to evaluate the independent effects of age, death period and birth cohort on the mortality rates of these tumours. Specific and age-adjusted mortality rates by tumour and sex were analysed. Age-period-cohort log-linear models were fitted separately for each tumour and sex, and segmented regression models were used to detect changes in period- and cohort-effect curvatures. Among men, the period-effect curvatures for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers displayed a mortality trend that rose until 1995 and then declined. Among women, oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality increased throughout the study period whereas oesophageal cancer mortality decreased after 1970. Stomach cancer mortality decreased in both sexes from 1965 onwards. Lastly, the cohort-effect curvature showed a certain degree of similarity for all three tumours in both sexes, which was greater among oral cavity, pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers, with a change point in evidence, after which risk of death increased in cohorts born from the 1910-1920s onwards and decreased among the 1950–1960 cohorts and successive generations. This latter feature was likewise observed for stomach cancer. While the similarities of the cohort effects in oral cavity/pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric tumours support the implication of shared risk factors, the more marked changes in cohort-effect curvature for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancer could be due to the greater influence of some risk factors in their aetiology, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. The increase in oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality in women deserves further study.","trends in oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancer mortality rates in spain, 1952–2006: an age-period-cohort analysis although oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancers share some risk factors, no comparative analysis of mortality rate trends in these illnesses has been undertaken in spain. this study aimed to evaluate the independent effects of age, death period and birth cohort on the mortality rates of these tumours. specific and age-adjusted mortality rates by tumour and sex were analysed. age-period-cohort log-linear models were fitted separately for each tumour and sex, and segmented regression models were used to detect changes in period- and cohort-effect curvatures. among men, the period-effect curvatures for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers displayed a mortality trend that rose until 1995 and then declined. among women, oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality increased throughout the study period whereas oesophageal cancer mortality decreased after 1970. stomach cancer mortality decreased in both sexes from",trend oral cavity pharyngeal oesophageal gastric mortality rate spain age period cohort although oral cavity pharyngeal oesophageal gastric share risk factor comparative mortality rate trend illness undertake spain evaluate independent effect age death period birth cohort mortality rate specific age adjust mortality rate sex analysed age period cohort log linear model fit separately sex segmented regression model use detect change period cohort effect curvatures among men period effect curvature oral cavity pharyngeal oesophageal display mortality trend rise decline among woman oral cavity pharyngeal mortality increase throughout period whereas oesophageal mortality decrease stomach mortality decrease sex,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer Research in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Consortiums, Implementation Science and Healthcare Delivery. Having caused over 8 million deaths worldwide in 2013, cancer is now the second leading cause of human death. 1 While cancer is often identified as a high-income country (HIC) health problem, low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) account for 57 % of cases and 65 % of cancer deaths globally. 2 The burden of cancer will continue to shift to less-developed countries due to the growth and aging of world populations, with increasing prevalence of known risk factors. 3 Looking ahead, the 12.7 million cases that occurred in 2008 are predicted to rise an additional 75 % to 22.2 million by 2030, the majority in LMICs. 4 Cancer demographics vary among countries but correlate with the level of economic development. 4 Cancers of the breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate account for half of the overall cancer burden in regions of the highest Human Development Index (HDI), while cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and liver are relatively more common in medium-HDI regions. Back in 1990, cervical cancer was more common than both breast and liver cancer in low-HDI regions but those trends are shifting. Cervical cancer prevention is improving as breast cancer rates continue to rise. 5 Overall, the rapid societal and economic transition in many countries means that any reductions in infection-related cancers (cervical, liver, stomach) are offset by an increasing number of new cases that are more associated with reproductive, dietary, and hormonal factors (breast, colorectal, prostate). 4 Global cancer consortiums (GCCs) can be defined as groups with a shared mission and common set of objectives that collaborate to advance some broad aspect of global","cancer research in low- and middle-income countries: consortiums, implementation science and healthcare delivery. having caused over 8 million deaths worldwide in 2013, cancer is now the second leading cause of human death. 1 while cancer is often identified as a high-income country (hic) health problem, low-and middle-income countries (lmics) account for 57 % of cases and 65 % of cancer deaths globally. 2 the burden of cancer will continue to shift to less-developed countries due to the growth and aging of world populations, with increasing prevalence of known risk factors. 3 looking ahead, the 12.7 million cases that occurred in 2008 are predicted to rise an additional 75 % to 22.2 million by 2030, the majority in lmics. 4 cancer demographics vary among countries but correlate with the level of economic development. 4 cancers of the breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate account for half of the overall cancer burden in",research low middle income country consortiums implementation science healthcare delivery cause million death worldwide second leading cause human death often identify high income country hic health problem low middle income country lmics account death globally burden continue shift less developed country due growth aging world population increase prevalence know risk factor look ahead million occur predict rise additional million majority lmics demographic vary among country correlate level economic development breast lung colorectum prostate account half overall burden,d,Stomach Cancer
"Clinical study to identify specific characteristics of cancer newly developed in the remnant stomach Cancer newly developed in the remnant stomach (CRS) after partial gastrectomy is worthy of attention not only because it is a typical model of carcinogenesis but also from the aspect of cancer diagnosis. We treated 47 patients with CRS in the 20 years from 1979 to 1998. Clinicopathological variables, as well as long-term survival results after the second surgery, were reviewed to clarify whether there were any differences in the characteristics of this disease entity compared with the usual primary gastric cancer. The mean time interval between the initial surgery and surgery for CRS was 25.8 years for patients with CRS with previous benign gastric lesions, and 10.6 years for those with previous gastric cancer. CRS was frequently detected at an early stage in the patients with previous cancer, and in the patients who had undergone reconstruction by the Billroth I method (regardless of the primary nature of the disease). Cancers with a differentiated histology developed more frequently in the patients who had undergone the initial surgery for cancer disease. Long-term survival results after the second surgery clearly demonstrated that surgical treatment for CRS was as effective as that for primary cancer in the upper stomach (PUC). In addition, it was confirmed that new lymphatic drainage into the lower mediastinum or the jejunal mesentery had developed after the initial gastric surgery. The findings suggested that patients with CRS and those with PUC should be treated similarly, although the findings of a high incidence of lymph node metastasis to the lower mediastinum and/or to the jejunal mesentery in the CRS patients should be taken into consideration.","clinical study to identify specific characteristics of cancer newly developed in the remnant stomach cancer newly developed in the remnant stomach (crs) after partial gastrectomy is worthy of attention not only because it is a typical model of carcinogenesis but also from the aspect of cancer diagnosis. we treated 47 patients with crs in the 20 years from 1979 to 1998. clinicopathological variables, as well as long-term survival results after the second surgery, were reviewed to clarify whether there were any differences in the characteristics of this disease entity compared with the usual primary gastric cancer. the mean time interval between the initial surgery and surgery for crs was 25.8 years for patients with crs with previous benign gastric lesions, and 10.6 years for those with previous gastric cancer. crs was frequently detected at an early stage in the patients with previous cancer, and in the patients who had undergone",identify specific characteristic newly develop remnant stomach newly develop remnant stomach cr partial gastrectomy worthy attention typical model carcinogenesis also aspect diagnosis treat cr year clinicopathological variable well long term survival result second surgery review clarify whether difference characteristic entity compare usual primary gastric mean time interval initial surgery surgery cr year cr previous benign gastric lesion year previous gastric cr frequently detect early stage previous undergone,d,Stomach Cancer
"PHF2 histone demethylase acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer. Plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) has a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by demethylating H3K9-Me2. Several genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region including the PHF2 gene is often deleted in some cancers including colorectal cancer, and this finding encouraged us to investigate the tumor suppressive role of PHF2. As p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in colon cancer, we tested the possibility that PHF2 is an epigenetic regulator of p53. PHF2 was associated with p53, and thereby, promoted p53-driven gene expression in cancer cells under genotoxic stress. PHF2 converted the chromatin that is favorable for transcription by demethylating the repressive H3K9-Me2 mark. In an HCT116 xenograft model, PHF2 was found to be required for the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin and doxorubicin. In PHF2-deficient xenografts, p53 expression was profoundly induced by both drugs, but its downstream product p21 was not, suggesting that p53 cannot be activated in the absence of PHF2. To find clinical evidence about the role of PHF2, we analyzed the expressions of PHF2, p53 and p21 in human colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients. PHF2 was downregulated in cancer tissues and PHF2 correlated with p21 in cancers expressing functional p53. Colon and stomach cancer tissue arrays showed a positive correlation between PHF2 and p21 expressions. Informatics analyses using the Oncomine database also supported our notion that PHF2 is downregulated in colon and stomach cancers. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PHF2 acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer development and ensures p53-mediated cell death in response to chemotherapy.","phf2 histone demethylase acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer. plant homeodomain finger 2 (phf2) has a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by demethylating h3k9-me2. several genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region including the phf2 gene is often deleted in some cancers including colorectal cancer, and this finding encouraged us to investigate the tumor suppressive role of phf2. as p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in colon cancer, we tested the possibility that phf2 is an epigenetic regulator of p53. phf2 was associated with p53, and thereby, promoted p53-driven gene expression in cancer cells under genotoxic stress. phf2 converted the chromatin that is favorable for transcription by demethylating the repressive h3k9-me2 mark. in an hct116 xenograft model, phf2 was found to be required for the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin and doxorubicin. in phf2-deficient xenografts, p53 expression was profoundly induced by both drugs,",phf histone demethylase act suppressor association p plant homeodomain finger phf role epigenetic regulation gene expression demethylating h k several genome wide demonstrate chromosomal region include phf gene often delete include colorectal finding encourage u investigate suppressive role phf p critical suppressor colon test possibility phf epigenetic regulator p phf associate p thereby promote p drive gene expression cell genotoxic stress phf convert chromatin favorable transcription demethylating repressive h k mark hct xenograft model phf find require anticancer effect oxaliplatin doxorubicin phf deficient xenograft p expression profoundly induce drug,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer incidence among First Nations adults in Canada: follow-up of the 1991 Census Mortality Cohort (1992-2009) Estimate site-specific cancer incidence rates for a wide range of cancers in First Nations adults in Canada, and compare these with rates in non-Aboriginal adults. Responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 Long Form Census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. First Nations- and non-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated with Poisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites). Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionally had higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lower incidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higher relative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only among First Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer was similar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed. First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy and programming. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to the significantly lower incidence observed for various cancer types.

"Expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 in gastric cancer and in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer. Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-β) constitute a family of polypeptide growth factors that control cell growth, cell differentiation and migration, as well as the formation of the extracellular matrix. Recent analyses revealed the overexpression of TGF-β1 in human gastric cancers and demonstrated increased cell proliferation in the stomach of patients with gastric cancer and their first-degree relatives. Using human gastric tissues obtained from patients with gastric cancer (n = 19), biopsies from healthy first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients (n = 18) and healthy individuals (n = 19), we analysed the expression of TGF-β1 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Fifteen of 19 patients with gastric cancer expressed TGF-β1 in the tumour. In 11 of these 15 cases TGF-β1 mRNA was also detectable in the non-tumourous stomach. Interestingly, all but two individuals with a first-degree relative diagnosed with gastric cancer exhibited TGF-β1 expression in either the antrum or corpus biopsy or both. In contrast, only one of 19 individuals without a family history of gastric cancer expressed TGF-β1 in the stomach (P< 0.0001). TGF-β1 expression is detectable in a large proportion of gastric cancers and in the stomach of healthy first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Since individuals without gastric cancers in their family express TGF-β1 only in one of 19 cases, the induction of TGF-β1 expression in first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer points to the presence of specific molecular alterations in a subgroup of individuals with an increased risk of developing gastric cancer that may precede the development of gastric cancers. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign","expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 in gastric cancer and in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer. transforming growth factors beta (tgf-β) constitute a family of polypeptide growth factors that control cell growth, cell differentiation and migration, as well as the formation of the extracellular matrix. recent analyses revealed the overexpression of tgf-β1 in human gastric cancers and demonstrated increased cell proliferation in the stomach of patients with gastric cancer and their first-degree relatives. using human gastric tissues obtained from patients with gastric cancer (n = 19), biopsies from healthy first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients (n = 18) and healthy individuals (n = 19), we analysed the expression of tgf-β1 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunohistochemistry. fifteen of 19 patients with gastric cancer expressed tgf-β1 in the tumour. in 11 of these 15 cases tgf-β1 mrna was also detectable in",expression transform growth factor beta gastric gastric mucosa first degree relative gastric transform growth factor beta tgf constitute family polypeptide growth factor control cell growth cell differentiation migration well formation extracellular matrix recent reveal overexpression tgf human gastric demonstrate increase cell proliferation stomach gastric first degree relative use human gastric tissue obtain gastric n biopsy healthy first degree relative gastric n healthy individual n analyse expression tgf use reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt pcr immunohistochemistry fifteen gastric express tgf tgf mrna also detectable,d,Stomach Cancer
"Phase 1a/1b and pharmacogenetic study of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with advanced cancer of the stomach or the gastroesophageal junction The prognosis of gastroesophageal cancer is poor, and current regimens are associated with limited efficacy. The purpose of this study was to explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of docetaxel, oxaliplatin plus capecitabine for advanced cancer of the stomach or the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. Patients were treated in escalating dose levels with docetaxel and oxaliplatin (both on day 1), plus capecitabine b.i.d. on days 1–14 every 3 weeks, to determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

"Gene methylation profile of gastric cancerous tissue according to tumor site in the stomach. There is considerable information on the methylation of the promoter regions of different genes involved in gastric carcinogenesis. However, there is a lack of information on how this epigenetic process differs in tumors originating at different sites in the stomach. The aim of this study is to assess the methylation profiles of the MLH1, MGMT, and DAPK-1 genes in cancerous tissues from different stomach sites. Samples were acquired from 81 patients suffering stomach adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery for gastric cancer in the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital Kaunas Clinics in 2009–2012. Gene methylation was investigated with methylation-specific PCR. The study was approved by the Lithuanian Biomedical Research Ethics Committee. The frequencies of methylation in cancerous tissues from the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the stomach were 11.1, 23.1, and 45.4 %, respectively, for MLH1; 22.2, 30.8, and 57.6 %, respectively, for MGMT; and 44.4, 48.7, and 51.5 %, respectively, for DAPK-1. MLH1 and MGMT methylation was observed more often in the lower third of the stomach than in the upper third (p < 0.05). In the middle third, DAPK-1 promoter methylation was related to more-advanced disease in the lymph nodes (N2–3 compared with N0–1 [p = 0.02]) and advanced tumor stage (stage III rather than stages I–II [p = 0.05]). MLH1 and MGMT methylation correlated inversely when the tumor was located in the lower third of the stomach (coefficient, –0.48; p = 0.01). DAPK-1 and MLH1 methylation correlated inversely in tumors in the middle-third of the stomach (coefficient, –0.41; p = 0.01).

"Time trends in socioeconomic differences in incidence rates of cancers of gastro-intestinal tract in Finland The magnitude of socioeconomic differences in health varies between societies, and over time within a given society. We studied the association between social class and incidence of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract over time in a large cohort in Finland. We studied social class variation among 45–69 year-old Finns during 1971–95 in incidence of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract by means of a computerized record linkage of the Finnish Cancer Registry and the 1970 Population Census, which included social class data. There were 2.3 million individuals in the cohort under follow-up, with 1622 cases of cancer of the esophagus, 8069 stomach (non-cardia), 1116 cardia, 408 small intestine, 6361 colon, 5274 rectum, 1616 liver, 1756 gallbladder, and 5084 pancreas during 1971–1995. Cancers of the esophagus, stomach, cardia, gallbladder and pancreas were most common among persons belonging to a low social class. Cancers of the small intestine in males only, colon in both genders, and rectum in females were most common in the higher social classes. Incidence of stomach cancer decreased and incidence of colon cancer increased over time in both genders in all social classes, and the large differences between social classes remained unchanged over time. Incidence rates of cardia cancer did not change substantially over time. There is a large variation in incidence of cancer of the gastrointestinal tract by social class in Finland. Although much of the observed social class differences probably could be explained by known etiological factors such as diet, physical exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking and exogenous hormone use, part of the variation is apparently attributable to largely unknown factors.","time trends in socioeconomic differences in incidence rates of cancers of gastro-intestinal tract in finland the magnitude of socioeconomic differences in health varies between societies, and over time within a given society. we studied the association between social class and incidence of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract over time in a large cohort in finland. we studied social class variation among 45–69 year-old finns during 1971–95 in incidence of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract by means of a computerized record linkage of the finnish cancer registry and the 1970 population census, which included social class data. there were 2.3 million individuals in the cohort under follow-up, with 1622 cases of cancer of the esophagus, 8069 stomach (non-cardia), 1116 cardia, 408 small intestine, 6361 colon, 5274 rectum, 1616 liver, 1756 gallbladder, and 5084 pancreas during 1971–1995. cancers of the esophagus, stomach, cardia, gallbladder and pancreas were most common among persons belonging",time trend socioeconomic difference incidence rate gastro intestinal tract finland magnitude socioeconomic difference health varies society time within give society association social class incidence gastro intestinal tract time large cohort finland social class variation among year old finn incidence gastro intestinal tract mean computerized record linkage finnish registry population census include social class data million individual cohort follow esophagus stomach non cardia cardia small intestine colon rectum liver gallbladder pancreas esophagus stomach cardia gallbladder pancreas common among person belong,d,Stomach Cancer
"A novel tumor-associated mucin of gastrointestinal carcinoma. Purpose: To identify a new tumor-associated antigen, a monoclonal antibody, SC142, was produced by immunizing mice with a stomach cancer cell line. The tumor specificity of mAb SC142 was studied by immunohistochemical staining, and the biochemical characteristics of this new gastrointestinal tumor-associated antigen were also studied. Methods: The expression of SC142-reactive antigen was investigated in various cancers by immunohistochemical staining. The SC142-reactive antigen was characterized by immunoblotting, sodium metaperiodate treatment assay, O-glycanase digestion assay, and lectin binding assay. Results: The SC142-reactive antigen was highly expressed in 78% of gastric cancers (29/37) and 87% of colon cancers (27/31). No normal colon or stomach tissues remote from the tumor were positive for the antigen. The antibody also reacted with other tumors of epithelial origin such as lung squamous cell cancer (2/4), breast ductal cancer (2/20), bladder transitional cell carcinoma (4/6), and uterine cancer (3/16). Western blot analysis of the antigen revealed glycoprotein(s) which migrated as a smear ranging from the origin of the gel to about the 80 kDa region. The reactivity of this antigen with SC142 was reduced by sodium metaperiodate treatment or O-glycanase digestion, but not by N-glycanase, suggesting that the epitope is an O-glycan. In lectin-binding assay, this antigen reacted only with wheat germ agglutinin but not with Ricinus communis agglutinin, Datura stramonium agglutinin, and Sambucus nigra agglutinin. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the antigen defined by SC142 is a tumor-associated antigen that could differentiate the gastrointestinal cancer cells from the normal cells. Therefore, SC142 may become a valuable tool for the immunohistochemical diagnosis and tumor immunoscintigraphy of the gastrointestinal cancer patients.","a novel tumor-associated mucin of gastrointestinal carcinoma. purpose: to identify a new tumor-associated antigen, a monoclonal antibody, sc142, was produced by immunizing mice with a stomach cancer cell line. the tumor specificity of mab sc142 was studied by immunohistochemical staining, and the biochemical characteristics of this new gastrointestinal tumor-associated antigen were also studied. methods: the expression of sc142-reactive antigen was investigated in various cancers by immunohistochemical staining. the sc142-reactive antigen was characterized by immunoblotting, sodium metaperiodate treatment assay, o-glycanase digestion assay, and lectin binding assay. results: the sc142-reactive antigen was highly expressed in 78% of gastric cancers (29/37) and 87% of colon cancers (27/31). no normal colon or stomach tissues remote from the tumor were positive for the antigen. the antibody also reacted with other tumors of epithelial origin such as lung squamous cell cancer (2/4), breast ductal cancer (2/20), bladder transitional cell carcinoma (4/6), and uterine cancer (3/16). western",novel associate mucin gastrointestinal carcinoma identify new associate antigen monoclonal antibody sc produce immunize mouse stomach cell line specificity mab sc immunohistochemical staining biochemical characteristic new gastrointestinal associate antigen also method expression sc reactive antigen investigate various immunohistochemical stain sc reactive antigen characterize immunoblotting sodium metaperiodate assay glycanase digestion assay lectin bind assay result sc reactive antigen highly express gastric colon normal colon stomach tissue remote positive antigen antibody also react epithelial origin lung squamous cell breast ductal bladder transitional cell carcinoma uterine western,d,Stomach Cancer
"Incidence Trend of Gastrointestinal Cancer in Markazi, in the Center of Iran, Population-Based Cancer Registry Results: 2010-2014. Gastrointestinal cancers are considered as the most common type of cancer among men and the second most common cancer in women after breast cancer in Iran. This study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi Province. This is an epidemiological study in which data was gathered from the population-based cancer registry program in the Markazi province of Iran during the years 2010–2014. Data were recorded in Excel software and coded based on ICD-O. All cases out of Markazi provinces were excluded from study, and cases with code C-15-C20 were included in this study. Stata 11 was used to analyze the data. In this study, 2975 new cases of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province were included in the analysis. The highest number of cancers was stomach (with 1595 cases), followed by colorectal cancer (980 cases), esophageal cancer (318 cases), and finally small bowl cancer (82 cases). The mean age of gastro-intestinal cancer diagnosis was 65.07 years. The results showed that with increasing age, the incidence of gastro-intestinal cancers increased, and in all sites and both sexes, the highest incidence of gastro-intestinal cancer was in the age group above 70 years. In both sexes, the age specific rate of stomach cancer was higher than other sites (with highest incidence in 2013) followed by colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and small bowl cancer. The results showed similar incidence rate of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province to other provinces in Iran. This study found that stomach cancer is the most common cancer in the Markazi province; therefore, identifying effective and preventing factors is necessary.","incidence trend of gastrointestinal cancer in markazi, in the center of iran, population-based cancer registry results: 2010-2014. gastrointestinal cancers are considered as the most common type of cancer among men and the second most common cancer in women after breast cancer in iran. this study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancer in markazi province. this is an epidemiological study in which data was gathered from the population-based cancer registry program in the markazi province of iran during the years 2010–2014. data were recorded in excel software and coded based on icd-o. all cases out of markazi provinces were excluded from study, and cases with code c-15-c20 were included in this study. stata 11 was used to analyze the data. in this study, 2975 new cases of gastrointestinal cancer in markazi province were included in the analysis. the highest number of cancers was stomach (with 1595 cases), followed",incidence trend gastrointestinal markazi center iran population base registry result gastrointestinal consider common type among men second common woman breast iran perform investigate epidemiology gastrointestinal markazi province epidemiological data gather population base registry program markazi province iran year data record excel software cod base icd markazi province exclude code c c include stata use analyze data new gastrointestinal markazi province include high number stomach follow,d,Stomach Cancer

"Sentinel lymph node mapping of the colon and stomach using lymphoseek in a pig model. Background: Lymphoseek is a radiopharmaceutical designed for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. The purpose of this study was to compare Lymphoseek colon and gastric pharmacokinetics with filtered [99mTc]sulfur colloid (fTcSC). Methods: Eight anesthetized pigs received an endoscopic injection of Lymphoseek or fTcSC in the stomach and colon. Scintigraphy was obtained of both administration sites at 15-minute intervals up to 3 hours after injection, after which all SLNs were identified by a handheld gamma probe through a laparotomy incision. Isosulfan blue was administered at the injection site 5 minutes before SLN mapping. The percentage of injected dose (%ID) was measured for all harvested nodes, and the clearance half-life (T;  c) was calculated for all injection sites. Results: The mean Lymphoseek clearance for colon (T;  c, 2.56 ± 1.04 hours) and gastric (T;  c, 3.83 ± 1.18 hours) injection sites was statistically faster (P = .030) compared with fTcSC (colon T;  c, 14.98 ± 3.41 hours; stomach T;  c, 14.52 ± 4.08 hours).

"Feasibility of esophageal reconstruction using a pedicled jejunum with intrathoracic esophagojejunostomy in the upper mediastinum for esophageal cancer. An alternative conduit is needed when the gastric tube cannot be used as an esophageal substitute for reconstruction after esophagectomy. We adopted pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis in the upper mediastinum under such circumstances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. Two hundred and ten patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction from 1998 to 2013. Among them, 6 patients underwent colon interposition (colon group) and 13 underwent jejunum reconstruction (jejunum group) including 8 thoracoscopic anastomosis. The operative results of both groups were compared with those of 191 gastric tube reconstructions (stomach group). The operative times in the colon and jejunum groups were significantly longer than that in the stomach group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively). The colon group showed more operative blood loss and more frequent anastomotic leakage and ischemic stenosis of the conduit than did the stomach group (1605 vs. 530 g, P = 0.007; 50 vs. 12.6 %, P = 0.035; 16.7 vs. 0 %, P = 0.03, respectively). There was no anastomotic leakage, conduit necrosis and mortality in the jejunum group. Ischemic stenosis of the conduit occurred more frequently in jejunum group than in the stomach group (23.1 vs. 0 %, P < 0.001). However, the stenosis could be managed safely with endoscopic treatment. Patient survival in the colon and jejunum groups was consistent with that in the stomach group.

The odds ratios (ORs) of the genotypes were not significant for any cancers combined or for any site of cancer, except for lung cancer (OR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.96 for CT relative to CC). The OR of current smoking for cancers of the esophagus and lung combined was different between the CC genotype (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.06–3.98) and TT genotype (OR, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.37–19.05), although the difference was not significant. ; Conclusion. This study suggests that the CC genotype of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism is associated with the risk of lung cancer, and that the TT genotype increases the risk of smoking for cancers of the esophagus and lung.","nad(p)h: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (nqo1) c609t polymorphism and the risk of eight cancers for japanese. methods. the cases were 102 patients with esophageal cancer, 143 with stomach cancer, 74 with colon cancer, 72 with rectal cancer, 192 with lung cancer, 237 with breast cancer, 56 with prostate cancer, and 108 with malignant lymphoma. controls consisted of outpatients from two sources: 241 noncancer outpatients who underwent gastroscopy and 399 first-visit outpatients, expected to include about 20% with cancer. genotyping was conducted by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (pcr-ctpp). ; results. the tt genotype with null enzyme activity was found in 19.9% of the 241 noncancer gastroscopy examinees, 16.5% of the 399 first-visit outpatients, 12.7% of the esophageal cancer patients, 16.8% of the stomach cancer patients, 13.5% of the colon cancer patients, 9.7% of the rectal cancer patients, 17.7% of the lung cancer patients, 14.3% of the breast cancer patients,",nad p h quinone oxidoreductase nqo c polymorphism risk eight japanese method esophageal stomach colon rectal lung breast prostate malignant lymphoma control consist outpatient two source noncancer outpatient undergo gastroscopy first visit outpatient expect include genotyping conduct polymerase chain reaction confront two pair primer pcr ctpp result tt genotype null enzyme activity find noncancer gastroscopy examinee first visit outpatient esophageal stomach colon rectal lung breast,d,Stomach Cancer
"Endocrine carcinoma of the stomach: clinicopathological analysis of 27 surgically treated cases in a single institute. Gastric endocrine carcinoma (EC) is an uncommon tumor of the stomach and the clinical features are not well known. Additionally, the classification and staging systems of this tumor are not yet unified worldwide. In this study, we reviewed 27 patients with gastric EC to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of this tumor. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with gastric EC among 6466 patients who had undergone gastrectomy between 1986 and 2008 at our institute. Clinicopathological features including immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 were investigated to evaluate the malignant potential of the tumor. Furthermore, survivals were compared between the 7th edition of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC)-TNM (7th TNM) classification for gastric cancer (GC) and the new TNM classification for foregut neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The median survival of the patients was 19.0 months. The 5-year survival rate was 100% in pathological stage (pStage) I, 40% in pStage II, 38% in pStage III, and 11% in pStage IV according to the 7th TNM classification for GC. Survivals by stage showed great difference between the 7th TNM classification for GC and the new TNM classification for foregut NET, but each system correlated with survival. The Ki-67 labeling index was more than 20% in most of the patients. Univariate analysis revealed that maximum tumor diameter, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, pStage, and curability had significant correlations with survival. Early detection and curative operations are essential for improving the prognosis of gastric EC. However, some adjuvant chemotherapies are required for advanced-stage tumors. Classification and staging systems may need to be unified worldwide for further analysis.","endocrine carcinoma of the stomach: clinicopathological analysis of 27 surgically treated cases in a single institute. gastric endocrine carcinoma (ec) is an uncommon tumor of the stomach and the clinical features are not well known. additionally, the classification and staging systems of this tumor are not yet unified worldwide. in this study, we reviewed 27 patients with gastric ec to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of this tumor. we retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with gastric ec among 6466 patients who had undergone gastrectomy between 1986 and 2008 at our institute. clinicopathological features including immunohistochemistry of ki-67 were investigated to evaluate the malignant potential of the tumor. furthermore, survivals were compared between the 7th edition of the international union against cancer (uicc)-tnm (7th tnm) classification for gastric cancer (gc) and the new tnm classification for foregut neuroendocrine tumors (net). the median survival of the patients was 19.0 months. the 5-year survival rate",endocrine carcinoma stomach clinicopathological surgically treat single institute gastric endocrine carcinoma ec uncommon stomach feature well know additionally classification stag system yet unify worldwide review gastric ec evaluate clinicopathological characteristic retrospectively review gastric ec among undergone gastrectomy institute clinicopathological feature include immunohistochemistry ki investigate evaluate malignant potential furthermore survival compare th edition international union uicc tnm th tnm classification gastric gc new tnm classification foregut neuroendocrine net median survival month year survival rate,d,Stomach Cancer
"Evaluation of rs10811661 polymorphism in CDKN2A / B in colon and gastric cancer. One of the causes of colon and gastric cancer is the dysregulation of carcinogenic genes, tumor inhibitors, and micro-RNA. The purpose of this study is to apply rs10811661 polymorphism in CDKN2A /B gene as an effective biomarker of colon cancer and early detection of gastric cancer. As a result,400 blood samples, inclusive of 200 samples from healthy individuals and 200 samples (100 samples from intestinal cancer,100 samples from stomach cancer) from the blood of someone with these cancers, to determine the genotype of genes in healthful and ill people through PCR-RFLP approach and Allelic and genotypic tests of SPSS software. To observe the connection between gastric cancer and bowel cancer risk and genotypes, the t-student test for quantitative variables and Pearson distribution for qualitative variables have been tested and the results have been evaluated using the Chi-square test. The effects confirmed that the highest frequency of TT genotypes is in affected individuals and CC genotype is in healthful individuals. In addition, it confirmed that women were more inclined than men to T3 tumor invasion and most grade II and III colon cancers, and in older sufferers with gastric cancer, the grade of tumor tended to be grade I. Among genetic variety and rs10811661, with invasiveness, there is a tumor size and degree in the affected person.

"Cell-free ascites from ovarian cancer patients induces Warburg metabolism and cell proliferation through TGFβ-ERK signaling. Ascites plays a key role in supporting the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells. Shear stress and carry-over of cancer cells by ascites flow support carcinogenesis and metastasis formation. In addition, soluble factors may participate in the procarcinogenic effects of ascites in ovarian cancer. This study aimed to determine the biological effects of cell-free ascites on carcinogenesis in ovarian cancer cells. Cell-free ascites from ovarian cancer patients (ASC) non-selectively induced cell proliferation in multiple models of ovarian cancer and untransformed primary human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, ASC induced a Warburg-type rearrangement of cellular metabolism in A2780 ovarian cancer cells characterized by increases in cellular oxygen consumption and glycolytic flux; increases in glycolytic flux were dominant. ASC induced mitochondrial uncoupling and fundamentally reduced fatty acid oxidation. Ascites-elicited effects were uniform among ascites specimens. ASC-elicited transcriptomic changes in A2780 ovarian cancer cells included induction of the TGFβ-ERK/MEK pathway, which plays a key role in inducing cell proliferation and oncometabolism. ASC-induced gene expression changes, as well as the overexpression of members of the TGFβ signaling system, were associated with poor survival in ovarian cancer patients. We provided evidence that the activation of the autocrine/paracrine of TGFβ signaling system may be present in bladder urothelial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Database analysis suggests that the TGFβ system may feed forward bladder urothelial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Soluble components of ASC support the progression of ovarian cancer. These results suggest that reducing ascites production may play an essential role in the treatment of ovarian cancer by inhibiting the progression and reducing the severity of the disease.","cell-free ascites from ovarian cancer patients induces warburg metabolism and cell proliferation through tgfβ-erk signaling. ascites plays a key role in supporting the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells. shear stress and carry-over of cancer cells by ascites flow support carcinogenesis and metastasis formation. in addition, soluble factors may participate in the procarcinogenic effects of ascites in ovarian cancer. this study aimed to determine the biological effects of cell-free ascites on carcinogenesis in ovarian cancer cells. cell-free ascites from ovarian cancer patients (asc) non-selectively induced cell proliferation in multiple models of ovarian cancer and untransformed primary human dermal fibroblasts. furthermore, asc induced a warburg-type rearrangement of cellular metabolism in a2780 ovarian cancer cells characterized by increases in cellular oxygen consumption and glycolytic flux; increases in glycolytic flux were dominant. asc induced mitochondrial uncoupling and fundamentally reduced fatty acid oxidation. ascites-elicited effects were uniform among ascites specimens. asc-elicited transcriptomic changes in",cell free ascites ovarian induce warburg metabolism cell proliferation tgf erk signal ascites play key role support metastatic potential ovarian cell shear stress carry cell ascites flow support carcinogenesis metastasis formation addition soluble factor may participate procarcinogenic effect ascites ovarian determine biological effect cell free ascites carcinogenesis ovarian cell cell free ascites ovarian asc non selectively induce cell proliferation multiple model ovarian untransformed primary human dermal fibroblast furthermore asc induce warburg type rearrangement cellular metabolism ovarian cell characterize increase cellular oxygen consumption glycolytic flux increase glycolytic flux dominant asc induce mitochondrial uncoupling fundamentally reduce fatty acid oxidation ascites elicit effect uniform among ascites specimen asc elicit transcriptomic change,d,Stomach Cancer
"Estrogen receptor β is expressed in human stomach adenocarcinoma Purpose. In stomach adenocarcinoma, the role of the hormonal receptor, estrogen receptor (ER), has been controversial. Recently, a new estrogen receptor, called estrogen receptor β (ERβ), was found to be expressed in various tissues including normal gastrointestinal tract. In this paper, the expression of ERβ in stomach adenocarcinomas has been investigated for the first time, specifically in signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, together with surrounding non-cancerous tissues. Methods. By immunohistochemistry the expression of ERα and β was studied in 29 stomach adenocarcinomas, ten signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, and 19 other adenocarcinomas. Western blotting was performed to examine the immunohistochemical result. Statistical studies (Student's t test and χ2-test) explored the relation between the immunohistochemical result and clinicopathological characteristics. Results. All 29 adenocarcinomas, including the signet ring cell ones, demonstrated clear ERβ nucleus staining. Lymphocytes, venous endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and non-cancerous stomach glands also showed strong ERβ staining, while no staining was observed in the immunohistochemistry of ERα. Western blotting showed equivalent ERβ protein levels in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, which was consistent with the results of immunohistochemical staining. Among signet ring cell adenocarcinomas of the stomach, cytoplasm were stained in addition to nuclei, specifically in patients under the age of 40 years. Conclusions. Our results imply that the effects of estrogen in stomach cancer, as well as those in normal stomach, may be mediated by ERβ, and that the role of ERβ may differ by the subtype of stomach adenocarcinoma – specifically signet ring cell adenocarcinomas and other ones – although large scale samples are needed to confirm these findings.","estrogen receptor β is expressed in human stomach adenocarcinoma purpose. in stomach adenocarcinoma, the role of the hormonal receptor, estrogen receptor (er), has been controversial. recently, a new estrogen receptor, called estrogen receptor β (erβ), was found to be expressed in various tissues including normal gastrointestinal tract. in this paper, the expression of erβ in stomach adenocarcinomas has been investigated for the first time, specifically in signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, together with surrounding non-cancerous tissues. methods. by immunohistochemistry the expression of erα and β was studied in 29 stomach adenocarcinomas, ten signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, and 19 other adenocarcinomas. western blotting was performed to examine the immunohistochemical result. statistical studies (student's t test and χ2-test) explored the relation between the immunohistochemical result and clinicopathological characteristics. results. all 29 adenocarcinomas, including the signet ring cell ones, demonstrated clear erβ nucleus staining. lymphocytes, venous endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and non-cancerous stomach glands",estrogen receptor express human stomach adenocarcinoma stomach adenocarcinoma role hormonal receptor estrogen receptor er controversial recently new estrogen receptor call estrogen receptor er find express various tissue include normal gastrointestinal tract paper expression er stomach adenocarcinoma investigate first time specifically signet ring cell adenocarcinoma together surround non cancerous tissue method immunohistochemistry expression er stomach adenocarcinoma ten signet ring cell adenocarcinoma adenocarcinoma western blotting perform examine immunohistochemical result statistical student test test explore relation immunohistochemical result clinicopathological characteristic result adenocarcinomas include signet ring cell one demonstrate clear er nucleus stain lymphocyte venous endothelial cell smooth muscle non cancerous stomach gland,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. By use of the postcoded database held by the Small Area Health Statistic Unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain was examined from 1974-86 (England), 1974-84 (Wales) and 1975-87 (Scotland). Numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. Observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. The study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. Over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (P<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Among these cancers in the second stage, the excess from 0 to 1 km ranged from 37% for liver cancer (0.95) excess cases 10(-5) per year to 5% for colorectal cancer. There was evidence of residual confounding near the incinerators, which seems to be a likely explanation of the finding for all cancers, stomach and lung, and also to explain at least part of the excess of liver cancer. For this reason and because of a substantial level of misdiagnosis (mainly secondary tumours) found among registrations and death certificates for liver cancer, further investigation, including histological review of the cases, is to be done to help determine whether or not there is an increase in primary liver cancer in the vicinity of incinerators.","cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in great britain. by use of the postcoded database held by the small area health statistic unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in great britain was examined from 1974-86 (england), 1974-84 (wales) and 1975-87 (scotland). numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. the study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (p<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. among these cancers in the",incidence near municipal solid waste incinerator great britain use postcoded database hold small area health statistic unit incidence million people live near municipal solid waste incinerator great britain examine england wale scotland number observed compare expect number calculate national rate regionally adjust stratification deprivation index base census small area statistic observe expected ratio test decline risk distance km conduct two stage first involve stratified random sample incinerator second remain incinerator two stage statistically significant p decline risk distance incinerator combine stomach colorectal liver lung among,d,Stomach Cancer
"Dietary risk factors in intestinal and diffuse types of stomach cancer: a multicenter case-control study in Poland. A hospital-based, multicenter, case-control study has been performed in Poland covering 741 incident stomach-cancer cases (520 males and 221 females) and the same number of controls. All stomach-cancer diagnoses were evaluated for histologic type according to the Lauren criteria. Fifty-one percent were of the intestinal type, 35 percent of the diffuse type, and 8.5 percent of the mixed type. The frequency of consumption of individual food items and several food groups was analyzed and the association of various foods with stomach cancer risk was evaluated after controlling for sex, age, occupation, education, and residency. Increased consumption of sausages was related significantly to gastric cancer risk, whereas increased consumption of cheese products, nonwhite bread, vegetables, and fruit was associated with decreased risk. A particularly strong decrease in risk was associated with consumption of radishes and onions. When consumption of fruits and vegetables, sausages, nonwhite bread, and cheese were introduced simultaneously in a multivariate model, independent effects were found only for fruit and vegetables, sausages, and nonwhite bread. The use of table salt, the frequency of eating hot meals, and an irregular eating pattern were also associated with increased risk, while additional consumption of fruit between meals showed reduced risk. If a reduction in vegetable and fruit consumption took place after marriage, an increased risk for stomach cancer was found, whereas augmented consumption of these food items after marriage decreased the risk. Separate risk models were calculated for stomach cancer of the intestinal and diffuse types, but both histologic varieties showed the same pattern of associations with dietary risk factors.","dietary risk factors in intestinal and diffuse types of stomach cancer: a multicenter case-control study in poland. a hospital-based, multicenter, case-control study has been performed in poland covering 741 incident stomach-cancer cases (520 males and 221 females) and the same number of controls. all stomach-cancer diagnoses were evaluated for histologic type according to the lauren criteria. fifty-one percent were of the intestinal type, 35 percent of the diffuse type, and 8.5 percent of the mixed type. the frequency of consumption of individual food items and several food groups was analyzed and the association of various foods with stomach cancer risk was evaluated after controlling for sex, age, occupation, education, and residency. increased consumption of sausages was related significantly to gastric cancer risk, whereas increased consumption of cheese products, nonwhite bread, vegetables, and fruit was associated with decreased risk. a particularly strong decrease in risk was associated with consumption of radishes",dietary risk factor intestinal diffuse type stomach multicenter control poland hospital base multicenter control perform poland cover incident stomach male female number control stomach diagnosis evaluate histologic type accord lauren criterion fifty one percent intestinal type percent diffuse type percent mixed type frequency consumption individual food item several food group analyze association various food stomach risk evaluate control sex age occupation education residency increase consumption sausage relate significantly gastric risk whereas increase consumption cheese product nonwhite bread vegetable fruit associate decrease risk particularly strong decrease risk associate consumption radish,d,Stomach Cancer
"Meeting report of the 73rd Japanese gastric cancer congress. surgical techniques. In this session, reconstruction methods after gastrectomy were discussed. K. Nakamura, Tokai University, evaluated the survival rates in patients who had undergone various reconstructive procedures after distal and total gastrectomy. They reported that higher 5-year survival rates were observed in patients who had undergone gastroduodenostomy and jejunal interposition, allowing food to pass through the duodenum, than in those who had undergone gastro-or esophagojejunostomy. They suggested that reconstruction enabling food to pass through the duodenum should be performed irrespective of the disease stage. Y. Nakane, Kansai Medical University, reported that reconstruction with a jejunal pouch after total gastrectomy was effective in the prevention of the small stomach syndrome, but that long-term emptying disorders were observed in some patients after Roux-en-Y anastomosis with a jejunal pouch. H. Kashimura, Jikei University, reported that the ileocolon interposition was superior to the Roux-en-Y method after total gastrectomy because less reflux esophagitis and more food intake occurred at each meal. K. Yamaguchi, Sapporo Medical University, evaluated jejunal pouch interposition after proximal gastrectomy both clinically and experimentally. They performed jejunal pouch interposition or esophagogastrostomy in beagles and showed that the former was superior to the latter in terms of changes in gastrointestinal hormones, maintenance of body weight, and emptying of the residual stomach. They concluded that jejunal pouch interposition should be considered after proximal gastrectomy. S. Kinami, Kanazawa University, evaluated jejunal pouch interposition after distal gastrectomy.

"Prognostic factors in gastric cancer survivors comparing Cox proportional hazards and machine learning using a Korean National cohort. Background As the prognosis of gastric cancer has improved, the exploration of prognostic factors has become increasingly important. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors of gastric cancer using machine learning and statistical methods and to compare the effectiveness of different methodologies in identifying prognostic factors. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cancer research data from survivors of gastric cancer in Korea. Patients were followed up from the date of curative treatment of gastric cancer to the date of recurrence, cancer-specific death, or censoring. The Cox proportional hazards, random survival forest, XGBoost, and DeepSurv models were used to calculate the risk of recurrence and cancer-specific death. All the models were trained on 80% of the training set, and the concordance index was used for comparison with 20% of the test set. The SHAP value was used for variable interpretation in the machine learning models. Results A total of 11,029 gastric cancer survivors with a median follow-up time of 6.19 years were included. Remnant stomach after gastric cancer treatment, T stage and N stage were the most important features for recurrence and mortality according to both the Cox model and the machine learning model. All the models had a concordance index greater than 0.7 without large differences. Conclusions The machine learning model is not inferior to conventional statistical analysis models and offers greater flexibility, especially when statistical assumptions are violated. The key prognostic factors identified through this approach include residual stomach after treatment and cancer stage.

"Genetic variation at 8q24, family history of cancer, and upper gastrointestinal cancers in a Chinese population Genetic variation at 8q24 is associated with prostate, bladder, breast, colorectal, thyroid, lung, ovarian, UADT, liver and stomach cancers. However, a role for variation at 8q24 in familial clustering of upper gastrointestinal cancers has not been studied. In order to explore potential inherited susceptibility, we analyzed epidemiologic data from a population-based case-control study of upper gastrointestinal cancers from Taixing, China. The study population includes 204 liver, 206 stomach, and 218 esophageal cancer cases and 415 controls. Associations between 8q24 rs1447295, rs16901979, rs6983267 and these cancers were stratified by family history of cancer. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for potential confounders: age, sex, education, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI at interview. We also adjusted for hepatitis B and aflatoxin (liver cancer) and Helicobacter pylori (stomach cancer). In a dominant model, among those with a family history of cancer, rs1447295 was positively associated with liver cancer (OR(adj) 2.80; 95% CI 1.15-6.80). Heterogeneity was observed (P(heterogeneity) = 0.029) with rs6983267 and liver cancer, with positive association in the dominant model among those with a family history of cancer and positive association in the recessive model among those without a family history of cancer. When considered in a genetic risk score model, each additional 8q24 risk genotype increased the odds of liver cancer by two-fold among those with a family history of cancer (OR(adj) 2.00; 95% CI 1.15-3.47).

"Gastric phenotype signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach with multiple bone metastases effectively treated with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. A 63-year-old woman presented with an abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis and radioisotope (RI) examination led to a strong suspicion of systemic bone metastatic tumors, although the origin was not known. Biopsies from bone metastatic lesions in the left ilium were performed under CT scan, and signet-ring cell carcinoma cells were detected pathologically. Also, a 0-IIc-like lesion was observed endoscopically in the stomach, and signet-ring cell carcinoma cells were also detected histologically. The patient’s platelet (Plt) levels were reduced and slight bleeding from the gingiva was detected when she brushed her teeth. Both the stomach and the bone metastatic lesions exhibited a gastric phenotype (G type) phenotypically. From these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having advanced (inoperable) stomach cancer with multiple bone metastases; she also exhibited disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We treated her with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (sequential MTX/5-FU) therapy after obtaining her informed consent. After six cycles of the chemotherapy, the abnormal ALP and Plt levels were alleviated. At present, she is receiving weekly sequential MTX/5-FU therapy at the outpatient oncology unit; she has been receiving the therapy for about 7 months since the detection of the bone metastases and has had a total of 17 cycles. In conclusion, sequential MTX/5-FU therapy was effective for a patient with G-type signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach with bone metastases, suggesting that the phenotypic classification may be one of the useful markers for prediction of the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with inoperable advanced stomach cancer.","gastric phenotype signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach with multiple bone metastases effectively treated with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. a 63-year-old woman presented with an abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (alp) level. computed tomography (ct) scan of the abdomen and pelvis and radioisotope (ri) examination led to a strong suspicion of systemic bone metastatic tumors, although the origin was not known. biopsies from bone metastatic lesions in the left ilium were performed under ct scan, and signet-ring cell carcinoma cells were detected pathologically. also, a 0-iic-like lesion was observed endoscopically in the stomach, and signet-ring cell carcinoma cells were also detected histologically. the patient’s platelet (plt) levels were reduced and slight bleeding from the gingiva was detected when she brushed her teeth. both the stomach and the bone metastatic lesions exhibited a gastric phenotype (g type) phenotypically. from these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having advanced (inoperable) stomach cancer with",gastric phenotype signet ring cell carcinoma stomach multiple bone metastasis effectively treat sequential methotrexate fluorouracil year old woman present abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase alp level compute tomography ct scan abdomen pelvis radioisotope ri examination lead strong suspicion systemic bone metastatic although origin know biopsy bone metastatic lesion left ilium perform ct scan signet ring cell carcinoma cell detect pathologically also iic like lesion observe endoscopically stomach signet ring cell carcinoma cell also detect histologically platelet plt level reduce slight bleeding gingiva detect brush teeth stomach bone metastatic lesion exhibit gastric phenotype g type phenotypically finding diagnose advance inoperable stomach,d,Stomach Cancer

"Distinct methylation patterns of two APC gene promoters in normal and cancerous gastric epithelia. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene is mutationally inactivated in both familial and sporadic forms of colorectal cancers. In addition, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the upstream portion of APC, a potential alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation, has been described in colorectal cancer. Because a subset of both gastric and colorectal cancers display the CpG island methylator phenotype, we hypothesized that epigenetic inactivation of APC was likely to occur in at least some gastric cancers. APC exhibits two forms of transcripts from exons 1A and 1B in the stomach. Therefore, we investigated CpG island methylation in the sequences upstream of exons 1A and 1B, i.e., promoters 1A and 1B, respectively. We evaluated DNAs from 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 40 primary gastric cancers, and 40 matching non-cancerous gastric mucosae. Methylated alleles of promoter 1A were present in 10 (100%) of 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 33 (82.5%) of 40 primary gastric cancers, and 39 (97.5%) of 40 noncancerous gastric mucosae. In contrast, promoter 1B was unmethylated in all of these same samples. APC transcripts from exon 1A were not expressed in nine of the 10 methylated gastric cancer cell lines, whereas APC transcripts were expressed from exon 1B. Thus, expression from a given promoter correlated well with its methylation status. We conclude that in contrast to the colon, methylation of promoter 1A is a normal event in the stomach; moreover, promoter 1B is protected from methylation in the stomach and thus probably does not participate in this form of epigenetic APC inactivation.","distinct methylation patterns of two apc gene promoters in normal and cancerous gastric epithelia. the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) tumor suppressor gene is mutationally inactivated in both familial and sporadic forms of colorectal cancers. in addition, hypermethylation of cpg islands in the upstream portion of apc, a potential alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation, has been described in colorectal cancer. because a subset of both gastric and colorectal cancers display the cpg island methylator phenotype, we hypothesized that epigenetic inactivation of apc was likely to occur in at least some gastric cancers. apc exhibits two forms of transcripts from exons 1a and 1b in the stomach. therefore, we investigated cpg island methylation in the sequences upstream of exons 1a and 1b, i.e., promoters 1a and 1b, respectively. we evaluated dnas from 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 40 primary gastric cancers, and 40 matching non-cancerous gastric mucosae. methylated alleles of",distinct methylation pattern two apc gene promoter normal cancerous gastric epithelia adenomatous polyposis coli apc suppressor gene mutationally inactivate familial sporadic form colorectal addition hypermethylation cpg island upstream portion apc potential alternative mechanism suppressor gene inactivation describe colorectal subset gastric colorectal display cpg island methylator phenotype hypothesize epigenetic inactivation apc likely occur least gastric apc exhibit two form transcript exon b stomach therefore investigate cpg island methylation sequence upstream exon b e promoter b respectively evaluate dna gastric cell line primary gastric match non cancerous gastric mucosa methylated allele,d,Stomach Cancer
"Eradication of Helicobacter pylori for primary gastric cancer and secondary gastric cancer after endoscopic mucosal resection Because most gastric cancers develop from a background of Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa, H. pylori plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. Therefore, eradication of H. pylori may inhibit the incidence of gastric cancers. In experimental studies, H. pylori eradication has proved to act as a prophylaxis against gastric cancer. However, the results of recent randomized controlled studies are absolutely contradictory. In Japan, mucosal gastric cancer is usually resected by endoscopic treatment. As only a small part of the gastric mucosa is resected, secondary gastric cancer after endoscopic resection of the primary gastric cancer often develops at another site in the stomach. A nonrandomized Japanese study involving 132 early gastric cancer patients reported that eradication of H. pylori after endoscopic resection tended to reduce the development of secondary gastric cancer. Also, a retrospective multicenter survey indicated that the incidence rate of secondary gastric cancer in H. pylori-eradicated patients was about one-third that among patients in the noneradication group. We conducted a large-scale multicenter randomized trial to confirm the effect of H. pylori eradication on secondary and residual gastric cancer after endoscopic resection. This study was begun in 2003 and is ongoing at present. Diagnosis of a new carcinoma at another site of the stomach is defined as the primary end point, and recurrence of tumors at the resection site as a secondary end point. A total of 542 subjects have been enrolled in the study. This study will have the statistical power to demonstrate whether H. pylori eradication decreases the incidence and recurrence of gastric cancer.","eradication of helicobacter pylori for primary gastric cancer and secondary gastric cancer after endoscopic mucosal resection because most gastric cancers develop from a background of helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa, h. pylori plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. therefore, eradication of h. pylori may inhibit the incidence of gastric cancers. in experimental studies, h. pylori eradication has proved to act as a prophylaxis against gastric cancer. however, the results of recent randomized controlled studies are absolutely contradictory. in japan, mucosal gastric cancer is usually resected by endoscopic treatment. as only a small part of the gastric mucosa is resected, secondary gastric cancer after endoscopic resection of the primary gastric cancer often develops at another site in the stomach. a nonrandomized japanese study involving 132 early gastric cancer patients reported that eradication of h. pylori after endoscopic resection tended to reduce the development of secondary gastric cancer. also, a retrospective multicenter",eradication helicobacter pylorus primary gastric secondary gastric endoscopic mucosal resection gastric develop helicobacter pylorus infect gastric mucosa h pylorus play important role gastric carcinogenesis therefore eradication h pylorus may inhibit incidence gastric experimental h pylori eradication prove act prophylaxis gastric however result recent randomize controlled absolutely contradictory japan mucosal gastric usually resect endoscopic small part gastric mucosa resect secondary gastric endoscopic resection primary gastric often develop another site stomach nonrandomized japanese involve early gastric report eradication h pylorus endoscopic resection tend reduce development secondary gastric also retrospective multicenter,d,Stomach Cancer
"Distribution and photodynamic effects of meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC) in the pancreas and adjacent tissues in the Syrian golden hamster Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has the potential to destroy small tumours with safe healing of adjacent normal tissue. This study looks at the effects of PDT on the normal pancreas and adjacent tissues in hamsters using the photosensitiser meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC). Pharmacokinetic studies used fluorescence microscopy on sections of pancreas, stomach and duodenum 1 h to 6 days after mTHPC. Highest levels of sensitiser were seen in the gastric and duodenal mucosa and in the acinar pancreas after 2-4 days. For PDT, light at 652 nm was delivered by placing a 0.2 mm diameter bare-ended fibre against the tissue. An energy of 50 J was used 2 or 4 days after 0.1 or 0.3 mg kg-1 mTHPC and animals killed 1 to 7 days later. Maximum necrosis was seen 3 days after PDT with lesions up to 4 mm in pancreas, 4.5 mm in duodenum and 2.5 mm in stomach. By fractionating the light dose, the lesion size could be increased by 30%. The main complication was free or sealed duodenal perforation (avoided by shielding the duodenum). Partial, reversible bile duct obstruction was seen occasionally. There was no macroscopic damage to the bile ducts or major blood vessels. Apart from the duodenum, all lesions healed safely. In this animal model, only the duodenum was at risk of serious, irreversible damage. Treatment is likely to be safer in the much thicker human duodenum. mTHPC is a powerful photosensitiser and suitable for further study for tumours in the region of the pancreas although care is required near the duodenum.","distribution and photodynamic effects of meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mthpc) in the pancreas and adjacent tissues in the syrian golden hamster photodynamic therapy (pdt) has the potential to destroy small tumours with safe healing of adjacent normal tissue. this study looks at the effects of pdt on the normal pancreas and adjacent tissues in hamsters using the photosensitiser meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mthpc). pharmacokinetic studies used fluorescence microscopy on sections of pancreas, stomach and duodenum 1 h to 6 days after mthpc. highest levels of sensitiser were seen in the gastric and duodenal mucosa and in the acinar pancreas after 2-4 days. for pdt, light at 652 nm was delivered by placing a 0.2 mm diameter bare-ended fibre against the tissue. an energy of 50 j was used 2 or 4 days after 0.1 or 0.3 mg kg-1 mthpc and animals killed 1 to 7 days later. maximum necrosis was seen 3 days after pdt with",distribution photodynamic effect meso tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin mthpc pancreas adjacent tissue syrian golden hamster photodynamic therapy pdt potential destroy small safe healing adjacent normal tissue look effect pdt normal pancreas adjacent tissue hamster use photosensitiser meso tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin mthpc pharmacokinetic use fluorescence microscopy section pancreas stomach duodenum h day mthpc high level sensitiser see gastric duodenal mucosa acinar pancreas day pdt light nm deliver place mm diameter bare end fibre tissue energy j use day mg kg mthpc animal kill day later maximum necrosis see day pdt,d,Stomach Cancer

"Effects of initial disease status on lymph flow following gastrectomy in cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach. In cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach (CRS), the lymphatic flow may be altered by the initial surgery. In this study of CRS after gastrectomy, we investigated how the regions of lymph node metastasis and changes in lymphatic flow depend on initial disease status. The study included 76 patients with CRS who underwent gastrectomy between September 2002 and November 2014. We analyzed and compared the clinicopathological factors and survival periods between patients after distal gastrectomy for malignant disease (group M, 33 patients) and patients after distal gastrectomy for benign disease (group B, 43 patients). The depth of tumor invasion was more advanced in group B (T1/T2/T3/T4: group M 18/1/7/7, group B 8/11/8/16; P = 0.002). However, the degree of lymph node metastasis did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Lymph node dissection was highly beneficial at station 3, station 7, and the mesojejunum in both groups, but not at stations 10 or 11d. As compared with group B, group M showed higher incidences of lymph node metastasis in the greater curvature, splenic hilum, and lymph nodes along the splenic artery, suggesting the predominance of lymphatic flows from the greater curvature to the splenic hilum and from the remnant stomach to the splenic artery.","effects of initial disease status on lymph flow following gastrectomy in cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach. in cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach (crs), the lymphatic flow may be altered by the initial surgery. in this study of crs after gastrectomy, we investigated how the regions of lymph node metastasis and changes in lymphatic flow depend on initial disease status. the study included 76 patients with crs who underwent gastrectomy between september 2002 and november 2014. we analyzed and compared the clinicopathological factors and survival periods between patients after distal gastrectomy for malignant disease (group m, 33 patients) and patients after distal gastrectomy for benign disease (group b, 43 patients). the depth of tumor invasion was more advanced in group b (t1/t2/t3/t4: group m 18/1/7/7, group b 8/11/8/16; p = 0.002). however, the degree of lymph node metastasis did not differ significantly between the two groups. the",effect initial status lymph flow follow gastrectomy carcinoma remnant stomach carcinoma remnant stomach crs lymphatic flow may alter initial surgery cr gastrectomy investigate region lymph node metastasis change lymphatic flow depend initial status include cr undergo gastrectomy september november analyze compare clinicopathological factor survival period distal gastrectomy malignant group distal gastrectomy benign group b depth invasion advanced group b group group b p however degree lymph node metastasis differ significantly two group,d,Stomach Cancer
"Tumour-promotion by lime oil in the mouse forestomach. IN a recent communication1 it was shown that four different citrus oils promoted tumour development in mouse skin after pretreatment with a sub-carcinogenic dose of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA). Since man is continuously exposed to these oils in his food, it was decided to test one of them, lime oil, both for carcinogenicity and for tumour-promoting activity in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice. Another reason was the hope of demonstrating the two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis in the alimentary canal. Previous attempts to do this have given inconclusive results2,3. In the most recent of these, Berenblum and Haran gave mice a single dose of one of four polycyclic hydrocarbons followed by 3 per cent croton oil weekly for 30 weeks. All treatments were given by stomach tube, and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) was the solvent throughout. The appropriate control groups were included. Numerous tumours of the fore-stomach developed in all their groups, both test and control. It was not stated whether the rest of the intestinal tract was examined. No evidence for tumour-promotion by croton oil was obtained. There are three possible reasons for this: (1) The doses of the hydrocarbons used were too high. Bock and King4 have since shown that the mouse forestomach is more sensitive than the skin to carcinogenic hydrocarbons. (2) Croton oil, in the concentration used, was carcinogenic. (3) PEG, although a suitable solvent for a single dose of a hydrocarbon5, reduces the tumour yield when given repeatedly after such a dose6 and is not, therefore, a suitable solvent for tumour-promoting substances.","tumour-promotion by lime oil in the mouse forestomach. in a recent communication1 it was shown that four different citrus oils promoted tumour development in mouse skin after pretreatment with a sub-carcinogenic dose of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (dmba). since man is continuously exposed to these oils in his food, it was decided to test one of them, lime oil, both for carcinogenicity and for tumour-promoting activity in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice. another reason was the hope of demonstrating the two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis in the alimentary canal. previous attempts to do this have given inconclusive results2,3. in the most recent of these, berenblum and haran gave mice a single dose of one of four polycyclic hydrocarbons followed by 3 per cent croton oil weekly for 30 weeks. all treatments were given by stomach tube, and polyethylene glycol 400 (peg) was the solvent throughout. the appropriate control groups were included. numerous tumours of",promotion lime oil mouse forestomach recent communication show four different citrus oil promote development mouse skin pretreatment sub carcinogenic dose dimethyl benzanthracene dmba since man continuously expose oil food decide test one lime oil carcinogenicity promoting activity gastro intestinal tract mouse another reason hope demonstrate two stage mechanism carcinogenesis alimentary canal previous attempt give inconclusive result recent berenblum haran give mouse single dose one four polycyclic hydrocarbon follow per cent croton oil weekly week give stomach tube polyethylene glycol peg solvent throughout appropriate control group include numerous,d,Stomach Cancer
"A novel method of intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, including a unique anastomotic technique: piercing the stomach with a linear stapler. Delta-shaped anastomosis is usually applied for an intracorporeal gastrogastrostomy in totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (TLPPG). However, the remnant stomach is slightly twisted around the anastomosis because it connects in side-to-side fashion. To realize an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy using an endoscopic linear stapler, we invented a novel method including a unique anastomotic technique. In this new approach, we first made small gastrotomies at the greater and lesser curvatures of the transected antrum and then pierced it using an endoscopic linear stapler. After the pierced antrum and the proximal remnant stomach were mechanically connected, the gastrotomies and stapling lines were transected using an endoscopic linear stapler, creating an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy. We have named this technique the “piercing method” because piercing the stomach is essential to its implementation. Between October 2015 and June 2017, 26 patients who had clinically early gastric cancer at the middle third of the stomach without clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis underwent TLPPG involving the novel method. The 26 patients successfully underwent an intracorporeal mechanical end-to-end gastrogastrostomy by the piercing method. The median operation time of the 26 patients was 272 min (range 209–357 min). With the exception of one gastric stasis, no problems associated with the piercing method were encountered during and after surgery. The piercing method can safely create an intracorporeal mechanical end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in TLPPG. Piercing the stomach using an endoscopic linear stapler is a new technique for gastrointestinal anastomosis. This method should be considered if the surgical aim is creation of an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in TLPPG.","a novel method of intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, including a unique anastomotic technique: piercing the stomach with a linear stapler. delta-shaped anastomosis is usually applied for an intracorporeal gastrogastrostomy in totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (tlppg). however, the remnant stomach is slightly twisted around the anastomosis because it connects in side-to-side fashion. to realize an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy using an endoscopic linear stapler, we invented a novel method including a unique anastomotic technique. in this new approach, we first made small gastrotomies at the greater and lesser curvatures of the transected antrum and then pierced it using an endoscopic linear stapler. after the pierced antrum and the proximal remnant stomach were mechanically connected, the gastrotomies and stapling lines were transected using an endoscopic linear stapler, creating an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy. we have named this technique the “piercing method” because piercing the stomach is essential",novel method intracorporeal end end gastrogastrostomy laparoscopic pylorus preserve gastrectomy early gastric include unique anastomotic technique pierce stomach linear stapler delta shape anastomosis usually apply intracorporeal gastrogastrostomy totally laparoscopic pylorus preserve gastrectomy tlppg however remnant stomach slightly twist around anastomosis connect side side fashion realize intracorporeal end end gastrogastrostomy use endoscopic linear stapler invent novel method include unique anastomotic technique new approach first make small gastrotomies great less curvature transected antrum pierce use endoscopic linear stapler pierced antrum proximal remnant stomach mechanically connect gastrotomies staple line transect use endoscopic linear stapler create intracorporeal end end gastrogastrostomy name technique piercing method pierce stomach essential,d,Stomach Cancer

Here we compared the oxygen and carbon contents ([C]) between proteomes of stomach cancer (hypoxia) and two stomach glandular cells (normal). Key proteins, genome locations, pathways, and functional dissection associated with stomach cancer were also studied. An association of oxygen content ([O]) and protein expression level was revealed in stomach cancer and stomach glandular cells. For differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), oxygen contents in the up regulated proteins were3.2%higherthan that in the down regulated proteins in stomach cancer. A total of 1,062 DEPs were identified; interestingly none of these proteins were coded on Y chromosome. The up regulated proteins were significantly enriched in pathways including regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cardiac muscle contraction, pathway of progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, etc. Functional dissection of the up regulated proteins with high oxygen contents showed that most of them were cytoskeleton, cytoskeleton associated proteins, cyclins and signaling proteins in cell cycle progression. Element signature of resource limitation could not be detected in stomach cancer for oxygen, just as what happened in plants and microbes. Unsaved use of oxygen by the highly expressed proteins was adapted to the rapid growth and fast division of the stomach cancer cells. In addition, oxygen usage bias, key proteins and pathways identified in this paper laid a foundation for application of stoichiogenomics in precision medicine.","stoichiogenomics reveal oxygen usage bias, key proteins and pathways associated with stomach cancer. stomach cancer involves hypoxia-specific microenvironments. stoichiogenomics explores environmental resource limitation on biological macromolecules in terms of element usages. however, the patterns of oxygen usage by proteins and the ways that proteins adapt to a cancer hypoxia microenvironment are still unknown. here we compared the oxygen and carbon contents ([c]) between proteomes of stomach cancer (hypoxia) and two stomach glandular cells (normal). key proteins, genome locations, pathways, and functional dissection associated with stomach cancer were also studied. an association of oxygen content ([o]) and protein expression level was revealed in stomach cancer and stomach glandular cells. for differentially expressed proteins (deps), oxygen contents in the up regulated proteins were3.2%higherthan that in the down regulated proteins in stomach cancer. a total of 1,062 deps were identified; interestingly none of these proteins were coded on y chromosome. the up regulated",stoichiogenomics reveal oxygen usage bias key protein pathway associate stomach stomach involve hypoxia specific microenvironments stoichiogenomics explores environmental resource limitation biological macromolecule term element usage however pattern oxygen usage protein way proteins adapt hypoxia microenvironment still unknown compare oxygen carbon content c proteome stomach hypoxia two stomach glandular cell normal key proteins genome location pathway functional dissection associate stomach also association oxygen content protein expression level reveal stomach stomach glandular cell differentially express protein deps oxygen content regulated protein higherthan regulated protein stomach total deps identify interestingly none protein cod chromosome regulated,d,Stomach Cancer
"Extent of resection in surgery of stomach carcinoma The extraluminal extent of resection in cases of advanced gastric cancer is controversial. If, however, following meticulous staging--including the detection of free abdominal tumor cells--complete resection seems possible, then multivisceral resection is justified. If complete resection is achieved, the prognosis of these patients can be improved. Left pancreatic resection should be performed only if the tumor invades the pancreas directly. Splenectomy is indicated if the tumor invades the organ directly or if there are locally advanced tumors of the proximal third of the stomach and tumors of the esophageal-gastric junction. However, it has to be kept in mind that splenectomy is an independent negative prognostic factor. The extent of lymphadenectomy (LA) in gastric cancer is still under discussion. According to the 10-year results of the Dutch Gastric Cancer Study, there might be subgroups which have a survival benefit after extended (D2) LA. These include, as the German Gastric Cancer Study corroborated, patients with very early stage II and stage IIIa lymph node metastases. As neither of these stages can at present be diagnosed before or during surgery, D2 lymphadenectomy should be the standard procedure for all patients with gastric cancer. Recent studies have shown that it might be possible with the help of the Sentinel Node Technique to individualize lymphadenectomy in locally gastric cancer as well. The beneficial effects of adjuvant chemoradiation in gastric cancer do not mean, however, that the extent of resection may be reduced. Adjuvant chemoradiation following complete resection and D2 lymphadenectomy should still not be regarded as standard therapy.","extent of resection in surgery of stomach carcinoma the extraluminal extent of resection in cases of advanced gastric cancer is controversial. if, however, following meticulous staging--including the detection of free abdominal tumor cells--complete resection seems possible, then multivisceral resection is justified. if complete resection is achieved, the prognosis of these patients can be improved. left pancreatic resection should be performed only if the tumor invades the pancreas directly. splenectomy is indicated if the tumor invades the organ directly or if there are locally advanced tumors of the proximal third of the stomach and tumors of the esophageal-gastric junction. however, it has to be kept in mind that splenectomy is an independent negative prognostic factor. the extent of lymphadenectomy (la) in gastric cancer is still under discussion. according to the 10-year results of the dutch gastric cancer study, there might be subgroups which have a survival benefit after extended (d2) la.",extent resection surgery stomach carcinoma extraluminal extent resection advanced gastric controversial however follow meticulous stag include detection free abdominal cell complete resection seem possible multivisceral resection justified complete resection achieve prognosis improve left pancreatic resection perform invade pancreas directly splenectomy indicate invade organ directly locally advanced proximal third stomach esophageal gastric junction however keep mind splenectomy independent negative prognostic factor extent lymphadenectomy la gastric still discussion accord year result dutch gastric might subgroups survival benefit extend la,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer incidence patterns in Koreans in the US and in Kangwha, South Korea Objective: In the US, Koreans are a rapidly growing group and comprised 10.5% of the total Asian population as of 2000. However, little has been published regarding cancer patterns in this subpopulation. Methods: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the California Cancer Registry, and the International Association for Research on Cancer, we compared age-adjusted and age-specific incidence rates for cancers of the prostate, breast, cervix, lung, colon, rectum, stomach, liver, and esophagus in US Koreans with rates of these cancers in residents of Kangwha, South Korea, and in US whites as a reference. Results: While the most frequently diagnosed cancer was lung among US Korean males and breast among US Korean females, it was stomach cancer for both sexes in Kangwha. Rates of prostate, breast, and colon cancer were considerably higher for Koreans in the US than in Kangwha, but were not as high as in whites. Cervical and stomach cancers showed the opposite racial/ethnic pattern, with rates highest in Kangwha, intermediate among US Koreans, and lowest among whites. Rates of rectal cancer in females and esophageal cancer in males were two-times higher in Kangwha than in US Koreans but esophageal cancer rates were similar between US Koreans and whites. Liver cancer rates were similar between Kangwha residents and US Koreans, but nearly 10-times lower among whites. Conclusions: Although these comparisons may have methodologic limitations, including data quality and racial/ethnic misclassification, the differences seen in migrant and native Koreans for some cancers warrant further investigation in this growing subpopulation.","cancer incidence patterns in koreans in the us and in kangwha, south korea objective: in the us, koreans are a rapidly growing group and comprised 10.5% of the total asian population as of 2000. however, little has been published regarding cancer patterns in this subpopulation. methods: using data from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program, the california cancer registry, and the international association for research on cancer, we compared age-adjusted and age-specific incidence rates for cancers of the prostate, breast, cervix, lung, colon, rectum, stomach, liver, and esophagus in us koreans with rates of these cancers in residents of kangwha, south korea, and in us whites as a reference. results: while the most frequently diagnosed cancer was lung among us korean males and breast among us korean females, it was stomach cancer for both sexes in kangwha. rates of prostate, breast, and colon cancer were considerably higher for koreans",incidence pattern korean u kangwha south korea u korean rapidly grow group comprise total asian population however little publish regard pattern subpopulation method use data surveillance epidemiology end result program california registry international association research compare age adjust age specific incidence rate prostate breast cervix lung colon rectum stomach liver esophagus u koreans rate resident kangwha south korea u white reference result frequently diagnose lung among u korean male breast among u korean female stomach sex kangwha rate prostate breast colon considerably high korean,d,Stomach Cancer

"Differential responses of scirrhous and well-differentiated gastric cancer cells to orthotopic fibroblasts. Scirrhous gastric cancer cells proliferate rapidly with fibrosis, when the cancer cells invade into the submucosa of the stomach. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the rapid proliferation, the growth interaction between gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts was examined. Human gastric cancer cell lines established from scirrhous carcinoma or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma were used. Human fibroblast cell lines were obtained from various organs. The growth interaction between gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts was examined by calculating the number of cancer cells or by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation of cancer cells. Gastric fibroblasts specifically stimulated the growth of scirrhous gastric cancer cells, but not that of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells. The growth factor(s) produced from gastric fibroblasts were then partially purified and characterised. The growth-promoting factor(s) had apparent molecular weights of 10000 dalton and was sensitive both to heat and proteinase treatment. No inhibition for the factor(s) was achieved with defined anti-growth factor antibodies. In this study, differential responses of scirrhous and well-differentiated gastric cancer cells to orthotopic fibroblasts were shown. Rapid proliferation of scirrhous gastric carcinoma should be partly controlled by orthotopic fibroblasts.

"Population density and cancer incidence differentials in New York State, 1978-82. Patterns of cancer incidence within five population density quintiles in New York State, exclusive of New York City, were investigated between 1978 and 1982. Sex-specific, standardized incidence ratios were calculated within each population density quintile for all cancer cases combined and for site-specific cancers based on cancer incidence patterns exhibited by the general population of New York State, exclusive of New York City. Areas with the highest population density demonstrated a 13 percent excess of cancer cases among males and a seven percent excess among females. In contrast, areas with the lowest population density exhibited lower cancer incidence, among both males (12 percent less) and females (12 percent less). Males demonstrated a significant, direct linear relationship between increasing population density and all cancer sites combined, and for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, bladder, brain, and nervous system, and for Hodgkin's disease and multiple myelomas. Among females, a significant, direct linear relationship was observed between increasing population density and all cancer sites combined, and for cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, lung, breast, and kidney. Malignant melanomas of the skin, and in situ and invasive cancers of the cervix exhibited unusual incidence patterns across the population density quintiles. These data are most useful in generating hypotheses for further studies to define specific etiologic factors operating within population density groupings. Population density, as measured in this investigation, may represent a surrogate measure for other factors which are related to cancer morbidity.","population density and cancer incidence differentials in new york state, 1978-82. patterns of cancer incidence within five population density quintiles in new york state, exclusive of new york city, were investigated between 1978 and 1982. sex-specific, standardized incidence ratios were calculated within each population density quintile for all cancer cases combined and for site-specific cancers based on cancer incidence patterns exhibited by the general population of new york state, exclusive of new york city. areas with the highest population density demonstrated a 13 percent excess of cancer cases among males and a seven percent excess among females. in contrast, areas with the lowest population density exhibited lower cancer incidence, among both males (12 percent less) and females (12 percent less). males demonstrated a significant, direct linear relationship between increasing population density and all cancer sites combined, and for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver,",population density incidence differential new york state pattern incidence within five population density quintiles new york state exclusive new york city investigate sex specific standardized incidence ratio calculate within population density quintile combine site specific base incidence pattern exhibit general population new york state exclusive new york city area high population density demonstrate percent excess among male seven percent excess among female contrast area low population density exhibit low incidence among male percent less females percent less male demonstrate significant direct linear relationship increase population density site combine oral cavity pharynx esophagus stomach colon rectum liver,d,Stomach Cancer
"Occupational cancer mortality among urban women in the former USSR. Occupational cancer mortality was evaluated among approximately three million female pensioners from urban areas of the former USSR. In 1970, these women experienced 14,918 cancer deaths. Occupational data were obtained from death certificates and the 1970 USSR National Population Census. Thirty-five occupational groups, including nine predominantly professional or office-work groups and 26 groups involving physical labor, were evaluated. The expected mortality rates were based on the urban female population of the USSR in 1970. Data for all cancer sites combined, and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix, and hematopoietic system are presented. Among all female pensioners, there were significant increases of all cancers combined (rate ratio [RR]=1.05), and cancers of the breast (RR=1.3), cervix (RR=1.3), and the hematopoietic system (RR=1.2), and a significant deficit of cancer of the esophagus (RR=0.8). Many well-established associations between cancer and occupation among men were observed among the study group of female pensioners, such as stomach and lung cancer among miners, and hematopoietic malignancies among scientists and physicians. Other associations, to be investigated further, also were observed, such as excess lung cancer among waitresses. The peak employment period for this cohort of women was during World War II and the postwar period, when Soviet women outnumbered men almost two-to-one. Consequently, many of the women held jobs that are typically held by men. Thus, this study provides valuable information on occupational risks to women that may be relevant in other countries where women increasingly are being employed in jobs traditionally held by men.","occupational cancer mortality among urban women in the former ussr. occupational cancer mortality was evaluated among approximately three million female pensioners from urban areas of the former ussr. in 1970, these women experienced 14,918 cancer deaths. occupational data were obtained from death certificates and the 1970 ussr national population census. thirty-five occupational groups, including nine predominantly professional or office-work groups and 26 groups involving physical labor, were evaluated. the expected mortality rates were based on the urban female population of the ussr in 1970. data for all cancer sites combined, and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix, and hematopoietic system are presented. among all female pensioners, there were significant increases of all cancers combined (rate ratio [rr]=1.05), and cancers of the breast (rr=1.3), cervix (rr=1.3), and the hematopoietic system (rr=1.2), and a significant deficit of cancer of the esophagus (rr=0.8). many well-established associations between cancer and",occupational mortality among urban woman former ussr occupational mortality evaluate among approximately three million female pensioner urban area former ussr woman experience death occupational data obtain death certificate ussr national population census thirty five occupational group include nine predominantly professional office work group group involve physical labor evaluate expected mortality rate base urban female population ussr data site combine esophagus stomach colon rectum lung breast cervix hematopoietic system present among female pensioner significant increase combine rate ratio rr breast rr cervix rr hematopoietic system rr significant deficit esophagus rr many well establish association,d,Stomach Cancer
"Feasibility and Nutritional Impact of Laparoscopy-assisted Subtotal Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer in the Upper Stomach Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) is commonly performed for early gastric cancer (EGC) in the upper stomach; however, the incidence of anastomotic complications remains high, and postoperative nutritional status is not satisfactory. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and nutritional impact of a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG). This was a retrospective study of 167 patients with EGC in the upper stomach. Of these, 57 patients underwent LAsTG, while 110 patients underwent LATG. Postoperative change in body weight, and serum concentration of albumin (Alb) and total protein (TP) were compared between the LAsTG and LATG groups. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the influence of potential confounding factors. Frequency of anastomotic complications was significantly higher in the LATG group (16.3 %) than in the LAsTG group (5.3 %, P = 0.040). Postoperative recovery of body weight at 12 months after surgery was significantly better in the LAsTG group (89.8 ± 1.4 %) than in the LATG group (82.1 ± 1.0 %, P < 0.001). By ANCOVA, adjusted mean differences of Alb and TP at 12 months after surgery between the LAsTG and LATG groups were 0.226 g/dl (95 % CI 0.141–0.312; P < 0.001) and 0.380 g/dl (95 % CI 0.265–0.495; P < 0.001); thus, the surgical procedure was significantly associated with the postoperative Alb and TP levels.

He underwent upper endoscopy for epigastric discomfort, which revealed mucosal erosion on the posterior wall of the middle body of the stomach, an elevated lesion on the duodenal bulb, and a raised tumor on the antrum of the stomach. He was diagnosed with gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma with early gastric cancer. One month after H. pylori eradication, a second upper endoscopy revealed no improvement in the gastric or duodenal mucosa, and areas of strong redness with a shallow recess just below the cardia of the stomach. As a result, a diagnosis of gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma with two gastric cancers was made. Total gastrectomy with proximal duodenum resection using intraoperative upper endoscopy and regional lymph node dissection was performed. Pathologically, gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma and three gastric cancers were detected. Since one of them was an advanced cancer, he started taking S-1 after his general condition improved. For early detection of gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma or gastric cancer, appropriate upper endoscopy and a biopsy are important.

"Initial results from a multi-center population-based cluster randomized trial of esophageal and gastric cancer screening in China. We initiated the first multi-center cluster randomized trial of endoscopic screening for esophageal cancer and gastric cancer in China. The objective of the study was to report the baseline screening findings in this trial. We recruited a total of 345 eligible clusters from seven screening centers. In the intervention group, participants from high-risk areas were screened by endoscopy; in non-high-risk areas, high-risk individuals were identified using a questionnaire and advised for endoscopy. Lugol’s iodine staining in esophagus and indigo carmine dye in stomach were performed to aid in the diagnosis of suspicious lesions. The primary outcomes of this study were the detection rate (proportion of positive cases among individuals who underwent endoscopic screening) and early detection rate (the proportion of positive cases with stage 0/I among all positive cases). A total of 149,956 eligible subjects were included. The detection rate was 0.7% in esophagus and 0.8% in stomach, respectively. Compared with non-high-risk areas, the detection rates in high-risk areas were higher, both in esophagus (0.9% vs. 0.1%) and in stomach (0.9% vs. 0.3%). The same difference was found for early-detection rate (esophagus: 92.9% vs. 53.3%; stomach: 81.5% vs. 33.3%).

"Gradual tube dilation method before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for obstructive esophageal cancer In patients with obstructive esophageal cancer (OEC) with stenosis of the tract to the stomach, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure cannot be performed if the endoscope is unable to pass through to the stomach. Our aim was to describe the safety and utility of the gradual tube dilation method (GTD) before PEG in cases of OEC. This study enrolled 38 consecutive patients. If an ultrathin transnasal endoscope (UTNE) could successfully reach the stomach through the esophageal stenosis, then PEG was performed without using the GTD. If even the UTNE could not be passed to the stomach, PEG was performed after the GTD. The GTD shows the method that gradually increases the size from an 8 Fr to 16 Fr nasogastric tube which passed through the obstruction before performing PEG. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who received the GTD. The complications were examined from the first UTNE to the completion of PEG. Seventeen of 38 patients received the GTD. All 17 patients successfully underwent the PEG procedures. The intubation period was 9.8 ± 3.4 days. The mean number of replacements was 2.5. Regarding complications, only three of the 17 patients experienced a sore throat. No significant differences were found in the PEG procedure times between the patients with the GTD and those without the GTD (P = 0.360). If patients with progressive esophageal cancer, such as OEC, need to undergo PEG, then the GTD is considered to be a useful modality for dilating the stenosis simply and safely.","gradual tube dilation method before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for obstructive esophageal cancer in patients with obstructive esophageal cancer (oec) with stenosis of the tract to the stomach, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) procedure cannot be performed if the endoscope is unable to pass through to the stomach. our aim was to describe the safety and utility of the gradual tube dilation method (gtd) before peg in cases of oec. this study enrolled 38 consecutive patients. if an ultrathin transnasal endoscope (utne) could successfully reach the stomach through the esophageal stenosis, then peg was performed without using the gtd. if even the utne could not be passed to the stomach, peg was performed after the gtd. the gtd shows the method that gradually increases the size from an 8 fr to 16 fr nasogastric tube which passed through the obstruction before performing peg. we conducted a retrospective review of all patients",gradual tube dilation method percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy obstructive esophageal obstructive esophageal oec stenosis tract stomach percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy peg procedure cannot perform endoscope unable pass stomach describe safety utility gradual tube dilation method gtd peg oec enrol consecutive ultrathin transnasal endoscope utne could successfully reach stomach esophageal stenosis peg perform without use gtd even utne could pass stomach peg perform gtd gtd show method gradually increase size fr fr nasogastric tube pass obstruction perform peg conduct retrospective review,d,Stomach Cancer
"Cancer-associated fibroblasts-derived VCAM1 induced by H. pylori infection facilitates tumor invasion in gastric cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a major role in the progression of stomach cancer, but the related mechanisms are not fully understood. H. pylori infection is recognized as one of the strongest risk factors for gastric carcinoma, but its effects on CAFs remain unknown. We aimed to determine the causative relationship between H. pylori infection in fibroblasts and the promoted cancer pathogenesis and progression in gastric cancer. Primary CAFs and normal activated fibroblasts (NAFs) were generated from gastric cancer patients. Gene signature of H. pylori-infected human stomach fibroblasts was performed using the RNA-seq analysis. Spheroid cell invasion assay and zebrafish cell line-derived xenograft (zCDX) model were introduced to evaluate tumor invasion induced by CAFs. The molecule interactions were determined using the kinetic binding analysis with the Biolayer Interferometry (BLI). Clinical significance and relevance were also assessed using the database analyses. H. pylori infection activated stomach fibroblasts and caused multiple gene alterations, including vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). H. pylori infection increased VCAM1 expression in CAFs in gastric carcinoma via activation of JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway, and VCAM1 levels were positively associated with tumor progression and dismal prognosis in stomach cancer patients. Furthermore, CAFs-derived VCAM1 molecularly interacted with integrin αvβ1/5 in gastric cancer cells facilitated tumor invasion in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify a novel mechanism underlying CAFs to promote tumor invasion during H. pylori infection. These studies facilitate us for a better understanding of the molecular process of gastric carcinoma progression, and provide the potential strategies for gastric cancer therapy.","cancer-associated fibroblasts-derived vcam1 induced by h. pylori infection facilitates tumor invasion in gastric cancer. cancer-associated fibroblasts (cafs) play a major role in the progression of stomach cancer, but the related mechanisms are not fully understood. h. pylori infection is recognized as one of the strongest risk factors for gastric carcinoma, but its effects on cafs remain unknown. we aimed to determine the causative relationship between h. pylori infection in fibroblasts and the promoted cancer pathogenesis and progression in gastric cancer. primary cafs and normal activated fibroblasts (nafs) were generated from gastric cancer patients. gene signature of h. pylori-infected human stomach fibroblasts was performed using the rna-seq analysis. spheroid cell invasion assay and zebrafish cell line-derived xenograft (zcdx) model were introduced to evaluate tumor invasion induced by cafs. the molecule interactions were determined using the kinetic binding analysis with the biolayer interferometry (bli). clinical significance and relevance were also assessed using",associate fibroblast derive vcam induce h pylori infection facilitates invasion gastric associate fibroblast cafs play major role progression stomach related mechanism fully understood h pylori infection recognize one strong risk factor gastric carcinoma effect cafs remain unknown determine causative relationship h pylori infection fibroblast promoted pathogenesis progression gastric primary cafs normal activated fibroblast nafs generate gastric gene signature h pylorus infect human stomach fibroblast perform use rna seq spheroid cell invasion assay zebrafish cell line derive xenograft zcdx model introduce evaluate invasion induce cafs molecule interaction determine use kinetic binding biolayer interferometry bli significance relevance also assess use,d,Stomach Cancer
"Comparison of long-term survival and immediate postoperative liver function after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer patients with liver cirrhosis Several studies have suggested no difference in the liver function of early gastric cancer (EGC) patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) between laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy. However, the number of patients and comparison of long-term survival rates between the two groups are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term survival and immediate postoperative liver function of EGC patients with LC after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy. The clinical data of EGC patients with LC who had no other malignancy and underwent distal gastrectomy at Asan Medical Center between January 2005 and April 2013 were investigated retrospectively. All patients were divided into two groups: the open group (OG) and laparoscopic group (LG). The clinicopathologic data of the two groups were compared. The number of patients in each group was 48 and 27 in the OG and LG, respectively. There were no significant differences in the age, sex ratio, ASA score, cause of liver cirrhosis, preoperative Child-Pugh classification, tumor location, TNM stage, total postoperative drain amount, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, morbidity and recurrence rate. Shorter hospital stay, longer operative time and more retrieved lymph nodes were observed in LG. The long-term overall survival rate was not different between the two groups (P = 0.356).

"Side overlap esophagogastrostomy to prevent reflux after proximal gastrectomy. No optimal method of reconstruction for proximal gastrectomy has been established because of problems associated with postoperative reflux and anastomotic stenosis. It is also important that the reconstruction is easily performed laparoscopically because laparoscopic gastrectomy has become widely accepted in recent years. We have developed a new method of esophagogastrostomy, side overlap with fundoplication by Yamashita (SOFY). The remnant stomach is fixated to the diaphragmatic crus on the dorsal side of the esophagus. The esophagus and the remnant stomach are overlapped by a length of 5 cm. A linear stapler is inserted in two holes on the left side of the esophageal stump and the anterior gastric wall. The stapler is rotated counterclockwise on its axis and fired. The entry hole is closed, and the right side of the esophagus is fixated to the stomach so that the esophagus sticks flat to the gastric wall. The surgical outcomes of the SOFY method were compared with those of esophagogastrectomy different from SOFY. Thirteen of the 14 patients in the SOFY group were asymptomatic without a proton pump inhibitor, but reflux esophagitis was observed in 5 of the 16 patients in the non-SOFY group and anastomotic stenosis was observed in 3 patients. Contrast enhancement findings in the SOFY group showed inflow of Gastrografin to the remnant stomach was extremely good, and no reflux into the esophagus was observed even with patients in the head-down tilt position.

"Cost of illness of the stomach cancer in Japan - a time trend and future projections Stomach cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Japan. The objectives of this study were to estimate and project the economic burden associated with stomach cancer in Japan, and to identify the key factors that drive the economic burden of stomach cancer. We calculated Cost of illness (COI) of 1996, 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2020 by using government office statistics and the COI method. We calculated direct cost and indirect cost (morbidity cost and mortality cost), and estimated the COI by summing them up. The number of deaths remained at approximately 50,000 in 1996–2008. COI was in downward trend from 1,293.5 billion yen in 1996 to 1,114.2 billion yen in 2008. Morbidity cost was 85.6 billion yen and 54.0 billion yen, mortality cost was 972.3 billion yen and 806.4 billion yen, and mortality cost per person was 19.4 million yen and 16.1 million yen in 1996 and 2008, respectively. Decrease of mortality cost that accounted for a large part of the COI (72.4% in 2008) was the major contributing factor. COI is predicted to decrease if the trend of health related indicators continues (442.8-1,056.1 billion yen depending on the model in 2020). Mortality cost per person is also predicted to decrease (9.5-12.5 million yen depending on the model in 2020). If the trend of health related indicators continues, it is estimated that COI of stomach cancer would decrease. “Aging”, “change of the healthcare providing system” and “new medical technology” are considered as contributing factors of COI.","cost of illness of the stomach cancer in japan - a time trend and future projections stomach cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in japan. the objectives of this study were to estimate and project the economic burden associated with stomach cancer in japan, and to identify the key factors that drive the economic burden of stomach cancer. we calculated cost of illness (coi) of 1996, 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2020 by using government office statistics and the coi method. we calculated direct cost and indirect cost (morbidity cost and mortality cost), and estimated the coi by summing them up. the number of deaths remained at approximately 50,000 in 1996–2008. coi was in downward trend from 1,293.5 billion yen in 1996 to 1,114.2 billion yen in 2008. morbidity cost was 85.6 billion yen and 54.0 billion yen, mortality cost was 972.3 billion yen and 806.4 billion",cost illness stomach japan time trend future projection stomach one leading cause death japan estimate project economic burden associate stomach japan identify key factor drive economic burden stomach calculate cost illness coi use government office statistic coi method calculate direct cost indirect cost morbidity cost mortality cost estimate coi sum number death remain approximately coi downward trend billion yen billion yen morbidity cost billion yen billion yen mortality cost billion yen billion,d,Stomach Cancer
"Dissemination of Free Cancer Cells from the Gastric Lumen and from Perigastric Lymphovascular Pedicles during Radical Gastric Cancer Surgery Manipulation and improper handling of a tumor during surgery may increase the risk of cancer cell dissemination after a curative gastrectomy. This study investigated the effect of improper handling of lymphovascular pedicles of stomach on tumor spillage during surgical procedure. Thirty-eight gastric cancer patients were enrolled. Three pairs of wash samples were obtained from each patient: (1) intraperitoneal wash samples obtained before (P0) and after gastrectomy (P1), (2) intragastric wash samples obtained before any manipulation (G0) and just before resection of the stomach (G1), and (3) ex vivo wash samples obtained by rinsing resected stomach with the lymphovascular pedicles closed by clips (S0) or with the pedicles open (S1). Cytologic examination was performed from all washes, and real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction analysis for carcinoembryonic antigen was performed from washes P0, P1, S0, and S1. Cytologic examination detected cancer cells in 34.2% (13 of 38) of G0 samples and in 39.5% (15 of 38) of G1 samples. The rate of conversion from G0-negative to G1-positive increased as T stage increased. Cytologic examination detected cancer cells in 2.6% (1 of 38) of S0 samples and in 13.2% (5 of 38) of S1 samples. The carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA level of the S1 sample was 2-fold greater than that of the S0 sample in 50.0% (7 of 14). Free cancer cells can be released from gastric lumen or lymphovascular pedicles opened during gastric cancer surgery, especially in advanced-stage disease.

"Case-control study of gastric cancer screening in Venezuela. A screening programme for early gastric cancer was introduced in the state of Tachira, Venezuela, in 1980. Screening was performed by photofluorography, using two mobile units. The efficacy of this programme in reducing mortality from stomach cancer was evaluated by means of a case-control study. Cases were 241 individuals who died from stomach cancer in the period 1985-89. Ten live controls per case were drawn from the electoral rolls, matched by sex, age and residence. Exposure to the screening examination of cases and controls was assessed through individual linkage with the programme's centralised database. After the exclusion of examinations occurring within the 6 months preceding the case's diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) of dying from stomach cancer for those screened was 1.26 (CI 0.83-1.91) and the OR in females was lower than in males: 0.77 (CI 0.33-1.78) and 1.52 (CI 0.94-2.47) respectively. Odds ratios associated with years since last test and number of tests did not differ significantly from 1. These results show the inefficacy of the programme in reducing mortality from gastric cancer in the area. In an attempt to determine whether this result was due to selection bias, an analysis restricted to subjects who had been screened at least once was performed. When examinations occurring after an index date at various intervals before the case's diagnosis were excluded, the screening test appeared to protect from death, although confidence intervals of the odds ratios are large, for example OR = 0.47 (CI 0.24-0.98) when excluding tests within 1 month.","case-control study of gastric cancer screening in venezuela. a screening programme for early gastric cancer was introduced in the state of tachira, venezuela, in 1980. screening was performed by photofluorography, using two mobile units. the efficacy of this programme in reducing mortality from stomach cancer was evaluated by means of a case-control study. cases were 241 individuals who died from stomach cancer in the period 1985-89. ten live controls per case were drawn from the electoral rolls, matched by sex, age and residence. exposure to the screening examination of cases and controls was assessed through individual linkage with the programme's centralised database. after the exclusion of examinations occurring within the 6 months preceding the case's diagnosis, the odds ratio (or) of dying from stomach cancer for those screened was 1.26 (ci 0.83-1.91) and the or in females was lower than in males: 0.77 (ci 0.33-1.78) and 1.52 (ci 0.94-2.47) respectively.",control gastric screen venezuela screening programme early gastric introduce state tachira venezuela screening perform photofluorography use two mobile unit efficacy programme reduce mortality stomach evaluate mean control individual die stomach period ten live control per draw electoral roll match sex age residence exposure screen examination control assess individual linkage programme centralise database exclusion examination occur within month precede diagnosis odds ratio die stomach screen ci female low male ci ci respectively,d,Stomach Cancer
"Reframing gastric lymph nodes as a parapancreatic lymph chain: an embryology-driven rationale for omento-bursectomy and omentum-preserving gastrectomy to facilitate safe infrapyloric lymph node dissection. The infrapyloric lymph nodes (LNs) are defined as No. 6 LNs and as one of the regional gastric LNs in the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma. No. 6 LNs are recommended to be dissected completely even in D1 lymphadenectomy for distal and total gastrectomy in the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guideline. Omento-bursectomy, whose survival advantage for advanced gastric cancer patients was not shown by the Japanese Clinical Oncology Group 1001 trial, has been proposed to be a useful technique for safe and secure dissection of No. 6 LNs in gastric cancer surgery. In the present review, we first discuss the reason why omento-bursectomy is considered to be a useful technique for dissection of No. 6 LNs, reframing the gastric LNs as a parapancreatic lymph chain based on the dorsal pancreas, mesogastrium, and mesoduodenum embryology. Second, we introduce the outermost layer-oriented dissection (OLD) of No. 6 LNs in performing an omentum-preserving gastrectomy (OPG) devised at Fujita Health University and their favorable outcomes. Last, we discuss the reason why the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is significantly higher than open gastrectomy for stage Ⅰ gastric cancer patients, for whom the OPG is likely performed, in a retrospective cohort study based on the Japanese National Clinical Database. Although single-institution retrospective clinical studies are referenced in this review, it is considered that reframing the gastric LNs as a parapancreatic lymph chain based on the embryology can enhance safe No.6 LNs dissection in the various types of gastric cancer surgery.","reframing gastric lymph nodes as a parapancreatic lymph chain: an embryology-driven rationale for omento-bursectomy and omentum-preserving gastrectomy to facilitate safe infrapyloric lymph node dissection. the infrapyloric lymph nodes (lns) are defined as no. 6 lns and as one of the regional gastric lns in the japanese classification of gastric carcinoma. no. 6 lns are recommended to be dissected completely even in d1 lymphadenectomy for distal and total gastrectomy in the japanese gastric cancer treatment guideline. omento-bursectomy, whose survival advantage for advanced gastric cancer patients was not shown by the japanese clinical oncology group 1001 trial, has been proposed to be a useful technique for safe and secure dissection of no. 6 lns in gastric cancer surgery. in the present review, we first discuss the reason why omento-bursectomy is considered to be a useful technique for dissection of no. 6 lns, reframing the gastric lns as a parapancreatic lymph chain based",reframing gastric lymph node parapancreatic lymph chain embryology drive rationale omento bursectomy omentum preserve gastrectomy facilitate safe infrapyloric lymph node dissection infrapyloric lymph node lns define lns one regional gastric lns japanese classification gastric carcinoma lns recommend dissect completely even lymphadenectomy distal total gastrectomy japanese gastric guideline omento bursectomy whose survival advantage advanced gastric show japanese oncology group trial propose useful technique safe secure dissection lns gastric surgery present review first discuss reason omento bursectomy consider useful technique dissection lns reframing gastric lns parapancreatic lymph chain base,d,Stomach Cancer
"A new approach to breast cancer analysis through histopathological images using MI, MD binary, and eight class classifying techniques Globally, cancer is the second deadliest disease in the world. The most familiar type of cancers affecting human beings is lung, colorectal, breast, cervical, stomach, thyroid, and stomach cancer. An individual affected by cancer suffers from physical, emotional, and financial restrain. The proper maintenance of the health system with early detection reduces the cancer death rate. Breast cancer is the most serious crisis that affects a major percentage of women. The superfluous intensification of cells in the breast is the main reason for breast cancer. The histopathological images are very useful in the diagnosis of breast cancer. However, it is a time-intensive and tedious task requiring long years of pathologist training. Today’s digital advancements can be exploited for automating this task. This paper presents a new learning approach for automating breast cancer Classifying is histopathological images into magnification independent (MI) and magnification dependent (MD) eight-class and binary classifying. For learning, we use the deep neural network-ResNet-18 and this is provided with Image Net training. The proposed learning technique mainly depends on the accurate tuning of the block-wise approach in which the deep network model's two terminal residual blocks can be educated. Additionally, we reinforced the proposed approach’s adaptability with Global Contrast Normalization and a three-fold rise in details concerning training data. The evaluation is carried out on Break His dataset. The results protrude our proposed technique to be effective in classifying breast cancer histopathological images into MI and MD eight-class and binary classes.

"Cancer in the Sami population of Sweden in relation to lifestyle and genetic factors The reindeer herding Sami of Sweden have low incidences of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cancer risk in a large cohort of Swedish Sami, containing Sami with different lifestyle and genetic Sami heritage. A cohort of 41,721 Sami identified in official national registers between 1960 and 1997, was divided into two sub-populations - reindeer herding Sami (RS) and non-reindeer herding Sami (NRS). A demographically matched non-Sami reference population (NS) was used as standard when incidence and mortality ratios were calculated. Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Swedish Cancer and Cause of Death Registers for the period 1961–2003. For Sami men, lower risks were found for cancers of the colon and prostate, and for malignant melanoma and non-Hodkins lymphoma, but higher for stomach cancer. The Sami women showed higher risks for cancers of the stomach and the ovaries, but lower risk for cancer of the bladder. The RS demonstrated lower relative cancer risks compared with the NRS. The lowest relative risk was found among the RS men, while the highest were observed among the NRS women. The RS men who had adopted a more westernized lifestyle showed a similar relative risk for prostate cancer as that of the NS living in the same region. Most of these differences in cancer risks could probably be ascribed to differences in lifestyle. It is concluded that the traditional Sami lifestyle contains elements, e.g. dietary contents and physical activity that may protect them from developing cancer.","cancer in the sami population of sweden in relation to lifestyle and genetic factors the reindeer herding sami of sweden have low incidences of cancer. the aim of the present study was to investigate the cancer risk in a large cohort of swedish sami, containing sami with different lifestyle and genetic sami heritage. a cohort of 41,721 sami identified in official national registers between 1960 and 1997, was divided into two sub-populations - reindeer herding sami (rs) and non-reindeer herding sami (nrs). a demographically matched non-sami reference population (ns) was used as standard when incidence and mortality ratios were calculated. incidence and mortality data were obtained from the swedish cancer and cause of death registers for the period 1961–2003. for sami men, lower risks were found for cancers of the colon and prostate, and for malignant melanoma and non-hodkins lymphoma, but higher for stomach cancer. the sami women showed higher",sami population sweden relation lifestyle genetic factor reindeer herd sami sweden low incidence present investigate risk large cohort swedish sami contain sami different lifestyle genetic sami heritage cohort sami identify official national register divide two sub population reindeer herd sami r non reindeer herd sami nrs demographically match non sami reference population n use standard incidence mortality ratio calculate incidence mortality data obtain swedish cause death register period sami men low risk find colon prostate malignant melanoma non hodkins lymphoma high stomach sami woman show high,d,Stomach Cancer
"Predicting lymph node status in early gastric cancer Accurate prediction of lymph node (LN) status is of crucial importance for appropriate treatment planning in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). However, there is no definitive consensus yet on which patient and/or tumor characteristics are associated with LN metastasis. A systematic search for studies investigating the relationship between patient and/or tumor characteristics and LN metastasis in EGC was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE. Patient and/or tumor characteristics associated with LN metastasis were identified by meta-analyzing results of individual studies. Forty-five studies were included. Variables significantly associated with LN metastasis in gastric cancer limited to the mucosa were: age younger than 57 years, tumor location in the middle part of the stomach, larger tumor size, macroscopically depressed tumor type, tumor ulcerations, undifferentiated tumors, diffuse tumor type according to the Lauren classification, lymphatic tumor invasion, tumors with a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index of more than 25%, and matrix metalloproteinase-9-positive tumors. Variables significantly associated with LN metastasis in gastric cancer limited to the submucosa were: female sex, tumor location in the lower part of the stomach, larger tumor size, undifferentiated tumors, increasing depth of submucosal invasion, lymphatic tumor invasion, vascular tumor invasion, increased submucosal vascularity, tumors with a PCNA labeling index of more than 25%, tumors with a gastric mucin phenotype, and vascular endothelial growth factor-C-positive tumors.

"Does remnant gastric cancer really differ from primary gastric cancer? A systematic review of the literature by the Task Force of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. Remnant gastric cancer, most frequently defined as cancer detected in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for benign disease and those cases after surgery of gastric cancer at least 5 years after the primary surgery, is often reported as a tumor with poor prognosis. The Task Force of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association for Research Promotion evaluated the clinical impact of remnant gastric cancer by systematically reviewing publications focusing on molecular carcinogenesis, lymph node status, patient survival, and surgical complications. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE with the keywords ""remnant,"" ""stomach,"" and ""cancer,"" revealing 1154 relevant reports published up to the end of December 2014. The mean interval between the initial surgery and the diagnosis of remnant gastric cancer ranged from 10 to 30 years. The incidence of lymph node metastases at the splenic hilum for remnant gastric cancer is not significantly higher than that for primary proximal gastric cancer. Lymph node involvement in the jejunal mesentery is a phenomenon peculiar to remnant gastric cancer after Billroth II reconstruction. Prognosis and postoperative morbidity and mortality rates seem to be comparable to those for primary proximal gastric cancer. The crude 5-year mortality for remnant gastric cancer was 1.08 times higher than that for primary proximal gastric cancer, but this difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, although no prospective cohort study has yet evaluated the clinical significance of remnant gastric cancer, our literature review suggests that remnant gastric cancer does not adversely affect patient prognosis and postoperative course.","does remnant gastric cancer really differ from primary gastric cancer? a systematic review of the literature by the task force of japanese gastric cancer association. remnant gastric cancer, most frequently defined as cancer detected in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for benign disease and those cases after surgery of gastric cancer at least 5 years after the primary surgery, is often reported as a tumor with poor prognosis. the task force of japanese gastric cancer association for research promotion evaluated the clinical impact of remnant gastric cancer by systematically reviewing publications focusing on molecular carcinogenesis, lymph node status, patient survival, and surgical complications. a systematic literature search was performed using pubmed/medline with the keywords ""remnant,"" ""stomach,"" and ""cancer,"" revealing 1154 relevant reports published up to the end of december 2014. the mean interval between the initial surgery and the diagnosis of remnant gastric cancer ranged from 10 to 30",remnant gastric really differ primary gastric systematic review literature task force japanese gastric association remnant gastric frequently define detect remnant stomach distal gastrectomy benign surgery gastric least year primary surgery often report poor prognosis task force japanese gastric association research promotion evaluate impact remnant gastric systematically review publication focus molecular carcinogenesis lymph node status survival surgical complication systematic literature search perform use medline keywords remnant stomach reveal relevant report publish end december mean interval initial surgery diagnosis remnant gastric range,d,Stomach Cancer
"Estimating the impact of a cancer diagnosis on life expectancy by socio-economic group for a range of cancer types in England Differences in cancer survival exist across socio-economic groups for many cancer types. Standard metrics fail to show the overall impact for patients and the population. The available data consist of a population of ∼2.5 million patients and include all patients recorded as being diagnosed with melanoma, prostate, bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers in England between 1998 and 2013. We estimated the average loss in expectation of life per patient in years and the proportion of life lost for a range of cancer types, separately by deprivation group. In addition, estimates for the total number of years lost due to each cancer were also obtained. Lung and stomach cancers result in the highest overall loss for males and females in all deprivation groups in terms of both absolute life years lost and loss as a proportion of expected life remaining. Female lung cancer patients in the least- and most-deprived group lose 14.4 and 13.8 years on average, respectively, that is translated as 86.1% and 87.3% of their average expected life years remaining. Melanoma, prostate and breast cancers have the lowest overall loss. On the basis of the number of patients diagnosed in 2013, lung cancer results in the most life years lost in total followed by breast cancer. Melanoma and bladder cancer account for the lowest total life years lost. There are wide differences in the impact of cancer on life expectancy across deprivation groups, and for most cancers the most affluent lose less years.","estimating the impact of a cancer diagnosis on life expectancy by socio-economic group for a range of cancer types in england differences in cancer survival exist across socio-economic groups for many cancer types. standard metrics fail to show the overall impact for patients and the population. the available data consist of a population of ∼2.5 million patients and include all patients recorded as being diagnosed with melanoma, prostate, bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers in england between 1998 and 2013. we estimated the average loss in expectation of life per patient in years and the proportion of life lost for a range of cancer types, separately by deprivation group. in addition, estimates for the total number of years lost due to each cancer were also obtained. lung and stomach cancers result in the highest overall loss for males and females in all deprivation groups in terms of",estimate impact diagnosis life expectancy socio economic group range type england difference survival exist across socio economic group many type standard metric fail show overall impact population available data consist population million include record diagnose melanoma prostate bladder breast colon rectum lung ovarian stomach england estimate average loss expectation life per year proportion life lose range type separately deprivation group addition estimate total number year lose due also obtain lung stomach result high overall loss male female deprivation group term,d,Stomach Cancer

"Dietary protein intake and stomach cancer, insights from a case-control study. Studies on the role of protein intake in the development of stomach cancer (SC) remain controversial. This study examines the relationship between protein intake from whole foods and SC in a Vietnamese population. A case-control study was designed in the university hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam, from 2003 to 2019. Participants included 1182 SC cases and 2995 controls. Of the participants, 2,580 were men, and 1,597 were women. Protein intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR, 95%CI) examined the risk of SC associated with total protein and subgroups of mammal-animals and fish-poultry protein. Overall protein intake was negatively associated with SC (fifth vs. first quintile: OR (95%CI): 0.41 (0.32, 0.51). The dose-response relationship was also observed per increment quintile, OR (95%CI): 0.81 (0.77, 0.86) for both genders, OR (95%CI): 0.82 (0.77, 0.88) in men, OR (95%CI): 0.80 (0.73, 0.87) in women, OR (95%CI): 0.82 (0.77, 0.86) for noncardiac and OR (95%CI): 0.79 (0.63, 1.00) for cardiac stomach cancer. The beneficial effects of SC remained for the protein sources from mammal-animals and fish-poultry protein. The significant inverse association between protein intake remained in the ever and never tobacco smoking, no-alcohol use and alcohol use, blood group A and AB, and O, H.

"Influence of Damaged Stomach on Anastomotic Leakage following Cervical Esophagogastrostomy in Patients with Esophageal Cancer Anastomotic leakage (AL) is one of the most common complications after esophagectomy. Although some patients have a history of peptic ulcers or other prior stomach diseases, the influence of a damaged stomach (DS) on AL incidence remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association between DS and incidence of AL in patients who underwent esophagectomy. Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 447 consecutive patients who underwent cervical esophagogastrostomy using gastric tube following esophagectomy were enrolled. DS was defined on the basis of endoscopic findings of ulcers or scars due to medical history or prior treatment. We compared the incidence of AL between patients with DS and those with a healthy stomach (HS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors that could predict AL incidence. Fifty-one patients (11.4%) had DS. Causes of DS included peptic ulcer (n = 36), endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer (n = 9), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies (n = 5), and post-chemotherapy scar for gastric malignant lymphoma (n = 1). Overall, AL occurred in 35 patients (7.8%). The incidence of AL in the DS group was significantly higher than in the HS group (15.7 vs. 6.8%, p = 0.03). DS was one of the independent predictive factors for AL (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–6.92; p = 0.03) on multivariate analysis. Further, the diseases in the lower third of the conduit were associated with AL.

"Family history of gastric cancer: a correlation between epidemiologic findings and clinical data. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind gastric cancer are still unclear. Its familial aggregation, on the other hand, has been very well documented by many epidemiologists. Nonetheless, only a limited number of studies have analyzed possible correlations between demographic and clinical data. Between January 1988 and August 2004, 541 patients underwent gastric resection with a curative intent at our department; demographic information, laboratory data, imaging, operative notes, and pathology reports were available for all patients. During 2004 we conducted a series of structured interviews with the surviving patients or their closest relatives regarding oncological family history, limited to first-degree relatives. Family history could be obtained in 383 patients (70.8%).

"Mediastinal lymph node dissection and distal esophagectomy is not essential in early esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. Optimal extent of surgery remains controversial in types 2 and 3 adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction (AEG). We aimed to determine whether the extended procedure including mediastinal lymphadenectomy is essential in all patients with AEG by comparing prognosis and recurrence of proximal gastric adenocarcinoma based on total gastrectomy with intra-abdominal lymphadenectomy. The clinicopathologic characteristics of 672 patients (type 2: 90, type 3: 211, upper third of the stomach: 371 cases) who underwent curative total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed. Recurrence was observed in 36.7, 16.1, and 16.1% of cases of type 2 AEG, type 3 AEG, and cancer of the upper third of the stomach, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 62.6, 82.5, and 84.6%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that in early cancers, there was no difference in survival between the groups (93.2 vs. 96.7 vs. 98.7%) but in advanced cancers, there was a difference (47.9 vs. 75.4 vs. 71.8%, P < 0.001). There was no survival difference in stage 1 (97.5 vs. 98.7 vs. 98.3%), but, in stage 2, type 2 AEG had a worse prognosis (41.9 vs. 92.1 vs. 83.0%). Types 2 and 3 advanced AEG had higher rates of locoregional recurrence, especially in the vicinity of the esophagojejunostomy and mediastinal lymph nodes compared to proximal gastric cancer. Total gastrectomy without mediastinal lymphadenectomy might produce favorable outcomes in early AEG and acquisition of a greater length of proximal margin, and removal of mediastinal lymph nodes might be helpful in advanced cancers.","mediastinal lymph node dissection and distal esophagectomy is not essential in early esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. optimal extent of surgery remains controversial in types 2 and 3 adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction (aeg). we aimed to determine whether the extended procedure including mediastinal lymphadenectomy is essential in all patients with aeg by comparing prognosis and recurrence of proximal gastric adenocarcinoma based on total gastrectomy with intra-abdominal lymphadenectomy. the clinicopathologic characteristics of 672 patients (type 2: 90, type 3: 211, upper third of the stomach: 371 cases) who underwent curative total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed. recurrence was observed in 36.7, 16.1, and 16.1% of cases of type 2 aeg, type 3 aeg, and cancer of the upper third of the stomach, respectively. the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 62.6, 82.5, and 84.6%, respectively. subgroup analysis revealed that in early cancers, there was no difference in survival between the",mediastinal lymph node dissection distal esophagectomy essential early esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma optimal extent surgery remain controversial type adenocarcinoma esophagogastric junction aeg determine whether extended procedure include mediastinal lymphadenectomy essential aeg compare prognosis recurrence proximal gastric adenocarcinoma base total gastrectomy intra abdominal lymphadenectomy clinicopathologic characteristic type type upper third stomach undergo curative total gastrectomy lymphadenectomy review recurrence observe type aeg type aeg upper third stomach respectively year free survival rate respectively subgroup reveal early difference survival,d,Stomach Cancer
"Risk factors and prognosis of gastric stasis, a crucial problem after laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early middle-third gastric cancer Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) is a function-preserving procedure for cT1N0 gastric cancer located in the middle-third of stomach, which is currently performed through a laparoscopic approach (LPPG). PPG is sometimes associated with a crucial problem during the early postoperative course, designated gastric stasis. However, information regarding gastric stasis remains to be fully elucidated. The study included 897 patients who underwent LPPG between 2005 and 2017. Early postoperative gastric stasis (E-stasis) was defined when the following conditions were fulfilled: upper abdominal distension, remnant stomach fullness on radiography image, and period of starvation exceeding 72 h within 1 month postoperatively. To evaluate long-term outcomes of E-stasis, late postoperative food residue (L-residue) was defined as grade 2 or higher food residue endoscopically according to the RGB (residue, gastritis, bile) classification at 1 year postoperatively. Risk factors and long-term outcomes of E-stasis were retrospectively analyzed. E-stasis was the most common complication during the early postoperative course. E-stasis occurred in 68 (7.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis identified age (≥ 61 years), DM, and postoperative intraabdominal infection as risk factors. At 1 year postoperatively, relative body weight ratio and postoperative serum albumin in the patients who experienced E-stasis was significantly lower than those in the other patients (P = 0.042 and 0.011, respectively). Of the patients who suffered from E-stasis, 42.5% experienced L-residue. E-stasis after LPPG occurs in 7.6% of patients. Age, DM, and intraabdominal infection are significantly related to E-stasis.

"Tautomycin: An inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A but not a tumor promoter on mouse skin and in rat glandular stomach Tautomycin isolated fromStreptomyces spiroverticillatus is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Tautomycin induced hyperphosphorylation of cytokeratin peptides in human keratinocytes (PHK 16-I cells) 30 times less strongly than did okadaic acid. Repeated applications of tautomycin (30 μg, 40 nmol/application) did not induce tumor promotion in a two-stage carcinogenesis experiment on mouse skin initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, whereas okadaic acid (1 μg, 1.2 nmol/application) as a control induced tumor promotion strongly. As for mucosa or rat glandular stomach, tautomycin induced ornithine decarboxylase 4 h after intubation into the stomach. The tumor-promoting activity of tautomycin was next studied in the glandular stomach initiated withN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Administration of tautomycin in the diet (1 mg rat−1 day−1), from week 9 to week 52 of the experiment, inhibited rather than enhanced tumor development in the glandular stomach initiated with MNNG. The percentages of tumor-bearing rats of the groups treated with MNNG plus tautomycin, MNNG alone, and tautomycin alone were 20.0%, 40.6%, and 0% respectively in week 52. The reason for the absence of tumor-promoting activity of tautomycin was studied in relation to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), an endogenous tumor promoter. We found that tautomycin neither enhanced TNFα mRNA expression in mouse skin nor induced TNFα release in a human stomach cancer cell line (KATO III cells), whereas okadaic acid did both. These results indicate that not all inhibitors of protein phosphatases are tumor promoters, and suggest that tumor promotion of the okadaic acid class of compounds is mediated by TNFα.","tautomycin: an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a but not a tumor promoter on mouse skin and in rat glandular stomach tautomycin isolated fromstreptomyces spiroverticillatus is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a. tautomycin induced hyperphosphorylation of cytokeratin peptides in human keratinocytes (phk 16-i cells) 30 times less strongly than did okadaic acid. repeated applications of tautomycin (30 μg, 40 nmol/application) did not induce tumor promotion in a two-stage carcinogenesis experiment on mouse skin initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, whereas okadaic acid (1 μg, 1.2 nmol/application) as a control induced tumor promotion strongly. as for mucosa or rat glandular stomach, tautomycin induced ornithine decarboxylase 4 h after intubation into the stomach. the tumor-promoting activity of tautomycin was next studied in the glandular stomach initiated withn-methyl-n′-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng). administration of tautomycin in the diet (1 mg rat−1 day−1), from week 9 to week 52 of the experiment, inhibited rather than enhanced tumor",tautomycin inhibitor protein phosphatase promoter mouse skin rat glandular stomach tautomycin isolate fromstreptomyces spiroverticillatus inhibitor protein phosphatase tautomycin induced hyperphosphorylation cytokeratin peptide human keratinocytes phk cell times less strongly okadaic acid repeat application tautomycin g nmol application induce promotion two stage carcinogenesis experiment mouse skin initiate dimethylbenz anthracene whereas okadaic acid g nmol application control induced promotion strongly mucosa rat glandular stomach tautomycin induce ornithine decarboxylase h intubation stomach promote activity tautomycin next glandular stomach initiate withn methyl n nitro n nitrosoguanidine mnng administration tautomycin diet mg rat day week week experiment inhibit rather enhance,d,Stomach Cancer
"Deciphering Aflatoxin B1 affected critical molecular pathways governing cancer: A bioinformatics study using CTD and PANTHER databases. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a fungal toxin consistently found as a contaminant in food products such as cereals, nuts, spices, and oilseeds. AFB1 exposure can lead to hepatotoxicity, cancer, immune suppression, reproductive deficiency, nutritional dysfunction, and growth impairment. AFB1 has also been listed as one of the most potent human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Although the correlation between AFB1 exposure and cancer initiation and progression is already reported in the literature, very little information is available about what molecular pathways are affected during cancer development. Considering this, we first selected AFB1-responsive genes involved in five deadliest cancer types including lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, and breast cancers from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Then, using the PANTHER database, a statistical overrepresentation test was performed to identify the significantly affected pathways in each cancer type. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) pathway, the CCKR signaling pathway, and angiogenesis were found to be the most affected pathways in lung, breast, liver, and stomach cancers. In addition, AFB1 toxicity majorly impacted apoptosis and Wnt signaling pathways in liver and stomach cancers, respectively. Moreover, the most affected pathways in colorectal cancer were the Wnt, CCKR, and GnRHR pathways. Furthermore, gene analysis was also performed for the most affected pathways associated with each cancer and identified thirteen key genes (e.g., FOS, AKT1) that may serve as biological markers for a particular type of AFB1-induced cancer as well as for in vitro AFB1 toxicological studies using specific cancer cell lines.","deciphering aflatoxin b1 affected critical molecular pathways governing cancer: a bioinformatics study using ctd and panther databases. aflatoxin b1 (afb1) is a fungal toxin consistently found as a contaminant in food products such as cereals, nuts, spices, and oilseeds. afb1 exposure can lead to hepatotoxicity, cancer, immune suppression, reproductive deficiency, nutritional dysfunction, and growth impairment. afb1 has also been listed as one of the most potent human carcinogens by the international agency for research on cancer. although the correlation between afb1 exposure and cancer initiation and progression is already reported in the literature, very little information is available about what molecular pathways are affected during cancer development. considering this, we first selected afb1-responsive genes involved in five deadliest cancer types including lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, and breast cancers from the comparative toxicogenomics database (ctd). then, using the panther database, a statistical overrepresentation test was performed to identify the significantly affected",decipher aflatoxin b affect critical molecular pathway govern bioinformatics use ctd panther database aflatoxin b afb fungal toxin consistently find contaminant food product cereal nut spice oilseed afb exposure lead hepatotoxicity immune suppression reproductive deficiency nutritional dysfunction growth impairment afb also list one potent human carcinogen international agency research although correlation afb exposure initiation progression already report literature little information available molecular pathway affect development consider first select afb responsive gene involve five deadly type include lung colorectal liver stomach breast comparative toxicogenomics database ctd use panther database statistical overrepresentation test perform identify significantly affect,d,Stomach Cancer

"Clinicopathological features and prognosis of developed gastric cancer based on the diagnosis of mucosal atrophy and enlarged folds of stomach by double-contrast upper gastrointestinal barium X-ray radiography. Mucosal atrophy and enlarged folds of stomach by double-contrast upper gastrointestinal barium X-ray radiography (UGI-XR) are two major features of Helicobacter pylori-induced chronic gastritis. These were previously shown to be risk indicators of gastric cancer, but their predictability for clinicopathological characters of developed gastric cancer is unelucidated. In addition, evidence for decreasing the mortality of gastric cancer by appropriate follow-up of UGI screening is needed. The 5134 generally healthy UGI-XR examinees, who underwent follow-up UGI-XR or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI-ES) more than once, were prospectively observed for 10 years. At the beginning of follow-up, 1515 (29.5%) had mucosal atrophy and 990 (19.5%) had enlarged folds. For the serum anti-H. pylori IgG, 1301 (25.3%) were positive, 177 (3.4%) were possibly positive, and 3656 (71.2%) were negative. During the 10-year observation period, gastric cancer developed in 15 subjects, among which 13 had mucosal atrophy and 10 had enlarged folds. These two features were expectedly useful indicators for gastric cancer incidence, but they showed no significant association with tumor stage or histological type of developed cancer. Only one of the 5134 subjects died of gastric cancer during 10 years, which was significantly lower than the predicted number of gastric cancer death (6.78 for 10 years) according to the mortality rate in Japan. Neither mucosal atrophy nor enlarged folds of stomach showed a significant association with clinicopathological features of developed gastric tumors.

"Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Although gastric cancer occurs frequently in Japan, few cases of hepatoid adenocarcinoma, a cancer with an extremely poor prognosis, have been reported. Here, we describe a 67-year-old Japanese man referred to our hospital with suspected gastric cancer. Gastrointestinal fiberscopy revealed an elevated lesion with a central depression on the lesser curvature, extending from the antrum to the body of the stomach. On the preoperative examinations, abdominal computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple metastases to the liver and no cirrhotic change. The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was markedly elevated (10,084 ng/ml). After a diagnosis of AFP-producing gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases was made, total gastrectomy, without liver resection, was performed. Microscopically, the tumor showed two main histological features. The main part of the tumor resembled moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and the rest showed fetal-type adenocarcinoma. Some parts of the hepatoma-like lesion showed periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules. Furthermore, the tumor showed diffuse immunohistochemical positivity for AFP, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and alpha-1 antichymotrypsin. According to these histopathological findings, the tumor was diagnosed as hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Although anastomotic leakage occurred postoperatively and the liver metastases have increased in size, the patient remains alive 11 months after the operation. Because of the poor prognosis for this histological type of tumor, accurate diagnosis of hepatoid adenocarcinoma is important, and long-term follow-up is required. We describe this rare case of hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach, and review the literature concerning the clinicopathological aspects.","hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach. although gastric cancer occurs frequently in japan, few cases of hepatoid adenocarcinoma, a cancer with an extremely poor prognosis, have been reported. here, we describe a 67-year-old japanese man referred to our hospital with suspected gastric cancer. gastrointestinal fiberscopy revealed an elevated lesion with a central depression on the lesser curvature, extending from the antrum to the body of the stomach. on the preoperative examinations, abdominal computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple metastases to the liver and no cirrhotic change. the serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (afp) was markedly elevated (10,084 ng/ml). after a diagnosis of afp-producing gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases was made, total gastrectomy, without liver resection, was performed. microscopically, the tumor showed two main histological features. the main part of the tumor resembled moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and the rest showed fetal-type adenocarcinoma. some parts of the",hepatoid adenocarcinoma stomach although gastric occur frequently japan hepatoid adenocarcinoma extremely poor prognosis report describe year old japanese man refer hospital suspected gastric gastrointestinal fiberscopy reveal elevated lesion central depression less curvature extend antrum body stomach preoperative examination abdominal compute tomography scan magnetic resonance imaging abdominal ultrasonography reveal multiple metastasis liver cirrhotic change serum level alpha fetoprotein afp markedly elevated ng ml diagnosis afp produce gastric multiple liver metastasis make total gastrectomy without liver resection perform microscopically show two main histological feature main part resemble moderately differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma rest show fetal type adenocarcinoma part,d,Stomach Cancer
"Non-familial juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancers: a case report. Juvenile polyposis is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the development of numerous hamartomatous and nonneoplastic polyps of the gastrointestinal tract. Juvenile polyposis has also recently been reported as a predisposition for gastrointestinal cancer. A 63-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy because of anemia and hypoalbuminemia during a follow-up for gastric polyposis, which showed multiple reddish polyps and two elevated lesions in the stomach. The elevated lesions were diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinomas by biopsy. He had no specific physical findings or family history. Computed tomography showed gastric wall thickening without lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Colonoscopy showed an adenoma in the transverse colon. He underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy. The resected specimen revealed numerous variously sized non-pedunculated polyps throughout the stomach, diagnosed histopathologically as hamartomatous polyps. The two elevated lesions were diagnosed as a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma restricted to the mucosa and a well-to-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the submucosa with prominent lymphatic permeation, respectively. Genetic analysis failed to identify any germline mutations in the genes usually associated with juvenile polyposis, including SMAD4 and BMPR1A. However, based on the few characteristic physical findings and histopathological features, the final diagnosis was juvenile polyposis restricted to the stomach. This patient represented a rare case of non-familial juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancers. Juvenile polyposis has malignant potential, and patients should therefore be carefully followed up. Surgical treatment, particularly total gastrectomy, is recommended as a standard treatment in patients with juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancer.","non-familial juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancers: a case report. juvenile polyposis is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the development of numerous hamartomatous and nonneoplastic polyps of the gastrointestinal tract. juvenile polyposis has also recently been reported as a predisposition for gastrointestinal cancer. a 63-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy because of anemia and hypoalbuminemia during a follow-up for gastric polyposis, which showed multiple reddish polyps and two elevated lesions in the stomach. the elevated lesions were diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinomas by biopsy. he had no specific physical findings or family history. computed tomography showed gastric wall thickening without lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. colonoscopy showed an adenoma in the transverse colon. he underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with roux-en-y esophagojejunostomy. the resected specimen revealed numerous variously sized non-pedunculated polyps throughout the stomach, diagnosed histopathologically as hamartomatous polyps. the two elevated lesions were diagnosed as a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma restricted to",non familial juvenile polyposis stomach gastric report juvenile polyposis autosomal dominant inherit characterize development numerous hamartomatous nonneoplastic polyp gastrointestinal tract juvenile polyposis also recently report predisposition gastrointestinal year old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy anemia hypoalbuminemia follow gastric polyposis show multiple reddish polyp two elevated lesion stomach elevated lesion diagnose well differentiate adenocarcinoma biopsy specific physical finding family history compute tomography show gastric wall thicken without lymphadenopathy distant metastasis colonoscopy show adenoma transverse colon underwent laparoscopy assist total gastrectomy roux en esophagojejunostomy resected specimen reveal numerous variously size non pedunculated polyp throughout stomach diagnose histopathologically hamartomatous polyp two elevated lesion diagnose well differentiate adenocarcinoma restrict,d,Stomach Cancer
"Changing natural history of differentiated thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing in many countries over the last 30 years. In the USA, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 3.6/100.000 people in 1973 to 8.7/100.000 people in 2002 [1]. This phenomenon is mainly due to an increase in the papillary histotype, which raised from 2.7 to 7.7/100.000, a 2.9-fold increase. The same trend has been reported in Europe [2]. The bulk of the increase is probably the results of better detection of small cancer, measuring 1.5 cm or less. Despite increasing incidence, the mortality from papillary thyroid cancer remained stable (0.5 deaths/100.000 in both 1973 and 2002) [1]. A recent study by Pagano et al. [3] confirm this trend in thyroid cancer patients diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in north Italy, in an area characterized by moderate iodine deficiency. The authors compared the epidemiological and clinico-pathological features of patients according to the time of diagnosis (1997–2005 and 2006–2010). The cut off of 2005 was chosen because it is coincident with the introduction of iodine prophylaxis and with the adoption of international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer [4, 5]. The main finding is that in more recent years, cancers were diagnosed at an earlier stage, in agreement with the similar observation in other European and North American countries. Increased scrutiny of the thyroid gland, mainly by neck ultrasound, is the most likely explanation for this phenomenon, but the other possibility is that some, as yet unknown, carcinogens in the environment might play a role. Up to now, the only established environmental risk factor for thyroid carcinoma is exposure to ionizing radiation, and the risk, particularly of papillary carcinoma, is greater in subjects of younger age at exposure, as demonstrated following the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 [6]. According to a network of populationbased cancer registries in Italy [7], the temporal trend for thyroid cancer in the period 1988–2002 showed a statistically significant increase of incidence rates in both male and females, that overall showed an annual percent increase of 4.0 % similar to the 3.8 % observed in USA [1]. Based on temporal relationship, it has been claimed that the increase might be a consequence of the Chernobyl fallout. However, no increase in thyroid gland abnormalities, such as nodularity or cancer, was found in northern Italy, among children already born at the time of Chernobyl nuclear accident, when examined 10 years after [8]. This epidemiological evidence does not favor any link between the Chernobyl accident and the increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma in countries other than Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Of particular interest is the finding that nearly 20 % of the patients reported by Pagano et al. [3] had an occupational exposure in textile industries. Although the study did not include a control group with the same exposure, the finding recalls a previous Chinese study [9] documenting an association between thyroid cancer and possible exposure to formaldehyde and benzene during long-term employment in textile industries. Another novel finding of Pagano et al. [3] is that cancers diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 presented more frequent association with autoimmune thyroid phenomena. The last observation might be linked to the augmented iodine intake after establishment of iodine prophylaxis in the country and it is in keeping with the evidence that in countries with high nutritional iodine intake the incidence of autoimmune thyroid disorders is higher compared to countries with F.

"Contemporary application of classical techniques in thyroid scanning The thyroid consists of two lobes that are connected by an isthmus. It is located anterior to the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. It produces two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Benign nodules and thyroid cancer are relatively common and amenable to detection by physical examination. Nuclear medicine is a part of medicine that uses radioisotopes for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.; ; Technetium-99m-pertechnate is widely used for imaging the thyroid gland. 99mTc is trapped by thyroid, but unlike iodine, it does not undergo organification and remains in the gland for a relatively short period. Imaging is done 30 min after administration of radiotracer. 123Iodine has a short physical half-life of 13 h. Both tracers are pure gamma emitters. 131Iodine is worse for imaging (except metastases in thyroid differentiated cancer) because it gives a high absorbed radiation dose related to the long physical half-life of 8 days and beta emissions. It is ideal for the treatment of thyroid disease, and used in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer, Graves’ disease, and toxic nodular goitre.; ; Indications for thyroid scintigraphy and RAI uptake are: differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, before treatment with radioiodine 131I, measuring of goitre volume, ectopic goitre, congenital hypothyroidism. Other indications are metastases of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (eg. papillary or follicular cancer). Very rarely, ovarian goitre is present.; ; The normal image of thyroid scan shows the typical butterfly shape (a shield shape according to the ancient Greeks), the position in the anterior neck area, the regular contour, without any interruption or mismatches. The distribution of the radiotracer is homogenous with intense, usually warm color in the middle of each lobe related to it thickness. The margins have a less intense color because of the decreased quantity of thyroid tissue. Physiologically the right lobe is often larger than the left one. There is imaging on the scan of the salivary glands.; ; Nuclear imaging of Graves’ disease is characterized by an enlarged gland and increased tracer uptake (usually more than 55%) that is distributed homogenously.; ; Toxic multinodular goitre shows irregular distribution of tracer and a normal or slightly elevated 131I uptake. The irregular tracer distribution is consistent with heterogeneity in cell function and growth, and the presence of micro- and macronodules. Large and discrete hyperfunctioning nodules may be associated with poor uptake in the extranodular thyroid tissue. The latter consists of suppressed normal tissue with less tracer accumulation. After 131I treatment, the areas that were cold may appear warm.; ; Although the use of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has diminished the use of thyroid scans in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the functional features of thyroid nodules have some prognostic significance. So-called cold nodules, which have diminished or no tracer uptake, are usually benign. However, these nodules are more likely to be malignant (5-10%) than hot nodules, which are almost always benign.; ; Subacute thyroiditis is associated with very low uptake because of follicular cell damage and TSH suppression. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis or factitious thyrotoxicosis are also associated with low uptake.; ; Thyroid scanning is used in the follow-up of thyroid cancer. After thyroidectomy and ablation using 131I, there is diminished tracer uptake in the thyroid bed, allowing the detection of metastatic thyroid cancer remnants that retain the ability to transport radioiodine. Whole body scans using 2-5 mCi (74-185 MBq) 131I are performed after thyroid hormone withdrawal to rise the TSH concentration or after the administration of rhTSH.; ; Radioiodine 131I may be also used for treatment benign or malignant thyroid disorders.","contemporary application of classical techniques in thyroid scanning the thyroid consists of two lobes that are connected by an isthmus. it is located anterior to the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. it produces two related hormones, thyroxine (t4) and triiodothyronine (t3). benign nodules and thyroid cancer are relatively common and amenable to detection by physical examination. nuclear medicine is a part of medicine that uses radioisotopes for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.; ; technetium-99m-pertechnate is widely used for imaging the thyroid gland. 99mtc is trapped by thyroid, but unlike iodine, it does not undergo organification and remains in the gland for a relatively short period. imaging is done 30 min after administration of radiotracer. 123iodine has a short physical half-life of 13 h. both tracers are pure gamma emitters. 131iodine is worse for imaging (except metastases in thyroid differentiated cancer) because it gives a high",contemporary application classical technique thyroid scan thyroid consist two lobe connect isthmus locate anterior trachea cricoid cartilage suprasternal notch produce two related hormone thyroxine triiodothyronine benign nodule thyroid relatively common amenable detection physical examination nuclear medicine part medicine use radioisotope diagnosis technetium pertechnate widely use image thyroid gland mtc trap thyroid unlike iodine undergo organification remain gland relatively short period imaging min administration radiotracer iodine short physical half life h tracer pure gamma emitter iodine bad image except metastasis thyroid differentiate give high,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer and Delphian node. The manuscript published in this volume of the European Archives of Otolaryngology discusses the incidence and impact of pre-laryngeal nodal metastasis in thyroid cancer [1]. The authors have used the title pre-laryngeal synonymous to Delphian nodes. The subject of Delphian node metastasis in thyroid cancer is well described for a number of years however interestingly there is very little original data published on the incidence of Delphian node metastasis in thyroid cancer except in the recent literature. The Australian group (Isaacs et al. [2, 3]) published their experience of large number of patients in whom Delphian nodes were removed and the incidence of metastasis was noted to be approximately 21 %. Our group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center looked at more than 100 patients with incidence of metastatic disease to be 25 % [4]. The authors in the present manuscript have reviewed their prospective experience of 67 patients undergoing prelaryngeal (Delphian node biopsy) with a metastatic incidence of 19.4 %. The authors have done a good job on correlating the incidence of metastatic disease to the highrisk thyroid cancer features such as size of tumor, extrathyroidal extension and isthmus involvement. These prognostic factors are extremely well defined both in terms of overall prognosis in patients with thyroid cancer and the incidence of nodal metastasis, be that to the Delphian node or the paratracheal or lateral jugular nodes. The authors have clearly reported higher incidence of paratracheal nodal metastasis in patients with positive Delphian node. Some of us who routinely look for the Delphian node are amazed that the node is generally hidden under the fascia covering the crico-thyroid muscle and extending between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. Unless one opens this fascia, the node may not be apparent. Occasionally, the node may be misrecognized as a pyramidal lobe of thyroid. It is important to explore this area. There is always a small vein crossing the cricoid cartilage which needs to be carefully secured to avoid intraoperative bleeding or postoperative development of hematoma. Clearly, the authors have added their own series to the recent few publications with high incidence of Delphian node positivity. The more you look for the Delphian node, the more one is likely to find the node and approximately 20–25 % of the patients will have positive Delphian nodes. Clearly, the patients with positive Delphian node are more likely to have other central compartment positive nodes however it is quite clear that this nodal metastasis probably does not have a major impact on the overall prognosis in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Its impact in patients with medullary thyroid cancer remains unclear as the experience is quite minimal in medullary thyroid cancer, however, we have noted some of the recurrences in medullary thyroid cancer especially in the Delphian area. The recent publication from the American Thyroid Association has described the central compartment as the area extending between the hyoid to the innominate vessels and from carotid to carotid laterally [5]. Interestingly, there are hardly any lymph nodes above the superior pole of the thyroid requiring extensive dissection between the hyoid to the superior pole of the thyroid however, the Delphian node removal should be a part of the proper central compartment clearance. We have used frozen section generously to evaluate the Delphian node. It is unlikely the positive frozen section would change the surgical procedure however if the Delphian node is positive, we are more A. R.

"Thyroid Cancer: 1999 Update and Evaluation of Solitary Thyroid Nodules Thyroid nodules are common; it is estimated that approximately 4% to 7% of the adult American population has a palpable thyroid nodule, and autopsy and high-resolution ultrasonography studies suggest that up to 50% of adults may have nodules within their thyroid gland.1,2 In contrast, malignant thyroid nodules are relatively rare; with approximately 17,200 new cases of thyroid cancer reported each year, malignant thyroid nodules represent only 1% of all malignancies and 0.5% of all cancer-related deaths.3,4 Because the overwhelming majority of thyroid nodules are benign, the clinician is faced with the difficult task of trying to identify the small number of patients with malignant nodules, which require surgical treatment, among the large number of patients with benign thyroid nodules. The clinical evaluation of a solitary thyroid nodule initially involves identifying risk factors that may increase the probability that a given nodule is malignant. These characteristics include prior neck irradiation; family history; age; whether or not the nodule is solitary; characteristics of the nodule, including size, consistency, and/or fixation; whether there are any enlarged lymph nodes; hoarseness; and pressure symptoms. Although thyroid function tests are often done, it is unusual for thyroid cancer to cause significant alterations in thyroid function. Other modalities that have been used in differentiating benign nodules from malignant ones include thyroid suppression therapy, cervical ultrasonography, and thyroid scintigraphy. First, thyroid suppression therapy, although frequently used, has not been shown to cause a statistically significant decrease in the size of nodules when compared with placebos in recent studies.5,6 There are also numerous reports of nodules that decreased in size during suppression therapy but subsequently turned out to be malignant.7 Second, cervical ultrasonography can identify extremely small nodules in the range of 1 mm in diameter; however, there are no ultrasonographic criteria that are pathognomonic for malignancy.8 Third, thyroid scintigraphy has been used enthusiastically in the past to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. If one looks at the scintigraphic characteristics of all nodules, 84.0% are cold (nonfunctioning), 10.5% are warm (having uniform tracer uptake), and 4.0% are hot (hyperfunctioning).9,10 Cancer is present in approximately 16% of cold nodules, 9% of warm nodules, and 4% of hot nodules. Therefore, if a nodule is cold, there is an 87% sensitivity for cancer, but specificity is only 30%. Over the past 10–15 years, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has emerged as the most accurate and cost-efficient way to differentiate benign from malignant nodules with an accuracy rate approaching 95%.11 FNA From the Department of Surgery (D.S.T.), Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Department of Surgery (A.R.S.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Department of Surgery (R.A.U.), The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Medical Specialties, Endocrinology (S.I.S.) and Department of Surgical Oncology (D.B.E.), The University of Texas M.

"Comment on Kasai et al.: Clinical profile of long-term survivors of breast or thyroid cancer with metastatic spinal tumours Dear Editor,; ; We read with great interest the paper by Kasai et al. [4] published in International Orthopaedics. We congratulate the authors on their work. We agree with them on one point and disagree on another one. The first is that a long time (above 5 years) between diagnosis of the thyroid cancer and the operation for the spinal metastases would be a good prognostic sign. However, we disagree that the “surgical strategy for spinal metastases” developed by us [5] would not expect survival in patients with spinal metastases from thyroid cancer.; ; In 2002, we reviewed 14 cases of thyroid cancer spinal metastases treated between December 1984 and July 2000 in the Orthopedic Department, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan. The patients included 9 females and 5 males. The primary tumor was follicular carcinoma in 10 and papillary carcinoma in 4. Four patients (28.6%) had presented with spinal metastases without a history of thyroid cancer and one patients presented with spinal metastases 14 years after excision of a thyroid lesion diagnosed as follicular adenoma. The remaining 9 patients developed their spinal metastases after a mean of 8.2 years from diagnosis of thyroid cancer (range 0.25–22 years). In total, those 14 patients received 25 operations [1]. When we applied the criteria suggested by Kasai et al. [4] on our patients, we found that five patients had their spinal metastases 5 years or more after diagnosis of thyroid cancer primary tumour; four out of those five patients (80%) survived for more than 5 years (mean 98.5, range 78–124 months). The fifth patient died 33 months after the operative intervention for the spinal metastases [1]. So, we completely agree with Kasai et al. [4] that a long time span (above 5 years) between diagnosis of the thyroid cancer and the operation for the spinal metastases would be a good prognostic sign with about 80% of the patients surviving for more than 5 years. However, we disagree with the conclusion regarding the invalidity of the surgical strategy for spinal metastases in survival predilection in cases of thyroid cancer. We reviewed the validity of the surgical strategy for spinal metastases in the same 14 cases of thyroid cancer spinal metastases. The strategy scores were detected for the 25 operations, whether performed before or after development of the strategy. Postoperative survival was detected and compared between different scores. Total scores after strategy application were 2 (7 operations; 28%), 3 (11 operations; 44%), 4 (2 operations, 8%) and 5 (5 operations, 20%). No patient had scores from 6–10 at the time of any operation. Survival after operations with scores 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 75.6 ± 25.8, 32.6 ± 27.8, 23 and 18.4 ± 9.8 months, respectively. Survival correlates with the score with correlation coefficient equals -0.68 (P = 0.005). Survival with scores of 2 and 3 after operation (candidates of long-term local control) was 51.4 ± 34.1 months while survival after operations for patients having the scores of 4 and 5 (candidates of middle-term local control) was 19.7 ± 10.5 months. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04) [2, 3]. From these results, we can conclude that the surgical strategy for spinal metastases would successfully predict survival in patients with thyroid cancer spinal metastases.","comment on kasai et al.: clinical profile of long-term survivors of breast or thyroid cancer with metastatic spinal tumours dear editor,; ; we read with great interest the paper by kasai et al.

"New genomic somatic amplifications and deletions in papillary thyroid cancer. There have been striking changes in the epidemiology of thyroid cancer worldwide with higher incidence rates, with low-risk or clinically less significant papillary thyroid cancer accounting for more than 80 % of new cases each year [1, 2]. During this change in epidemiology, our knowledge in the genetic and genomic alterations associated with thyroid cancer initiation and or progression has also expanded tremendously [3]. As precision medicine is becoming a reality for some solid malignancies, the application of new knowledge to the management of thyroid cancer is going to be imperative to precisely treat patients based on the genetics/genomics of their tumor, especially when it is found to be associated with disease behavior [4]. The study by Passon and colleagues from Italy reports new findings based on a careful analysis of 27 papillary thyroid cancer samples using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization [5]. The investigators found that genomic amplifications were higher in high/intermediaterisk group tumors and that genomic deletions were higher in low-risk tumors based on the American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system. Several of these genomic amplifications and deletions were recurrent (occurred in more than 20 % of tumor samples) and several of the genes in the chromosomal loci with deletions have been implicated to be involved in thyroid cancer or their expression is dysregulated in cancer. The most frequent amplifications that were detected in 2q35, 4q26, and 4q34.1 contained FN1, PDE5A, and GALNTL6, respectively. The 2q35 locus is thought to be a breast cancer susceptibility locus, and FN1 expression was found to be restricted to thyroid cancer samples and absent in benign lesions [6, 7]. Interestingly, 60 % of the cases with 2q35 amplification were TNM Stage I according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, whereas more than 70 % were considered intermediate/high risk according to the ATA risk classification system. Although both systems include some of the same variables, the AJCC staging system also includes the patient’s age at diagnosis so that patients younger than 45 years even with lymph node and or distant metastases are considered as having only stage I/II disease. Also the ATA risk stratification system includes postoperative serum thyroglobulin level measurement. Thus, these factors likely explain the somewhat discrepant results. The amplification in 4q26 involving PDE5 was more prevalent in intermediate/highrisk cancers. Interestingly, studies have shown that tumors with high expression level of PDE5 have lower mRNA expression of differentiation markers or thyroid-specific genes (TG, TSHR, TPO, and NIS) [8]. Thus, PDE5 could be involved in thyroid cancer initiation, progression, or even radioiodine resistance. The authors also investigated the BRAF mutation status in the tumors analyzed but found no significant association with genomic amplifications or deletions. Most, but not all, studies have suggested that papillary thyroid cancers with BRAF mutations are more aggressive and that it is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in papillary thyroid cancer [3, 9]. Passon and colleague did find that 8 of the BRAF V600E mutant samples were in patients with ATA intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancers. It would be interesting to know if the genomic deletion status in addition to BRAF mutation status could better stratify ATA low-risk from intermediate/high-risk papillary thyroid cancer or even outperform & Electron Kebebew kebebewe@mail.nih.gov","new genomic somatic amplifications and deletions in papillary thyroid cancer. there have been striking changes in the epidemiology of thyroid cancer worldwide with higher incidence rates, with low-risk or clinically less significant papillary thyroid cancer accounting for more than 80 % of new cases each year [1, 2]. during this change in epidemiology, our knowledge in the genetic and genomic alterations associated with thyroid cancer initiation and or progression has also expanded tremendously [3]. as precision medicine is becoming a reality for some solid malignancies, the application of new knowledge to the management of thyroid cancer is going to be imperative to precisely treat patients based on the genetics/genomics of their tumor, especially when it is found to be associated with disease behavior [4]. the study by passon and colleagues from italy reports new findings based on a careful analysis of 27 papillary thyroid cancer samples using high-resolution comparative genomic",new genomic somatic amplification deletion papillary thyroid striking change epidemiology thyroid worldwide high incidence rate low risk clinically less significant papillary thyroid accounting new year change epidemiology knowledge genetic genomic alteration associate thyroid initiation progression also expand tremendously precision medicine become reality solid malignancy application new knowledge management thyroid go imperative precisely treat base genetics genomics especially find associate behavior passon colleague italy report new finding base careful papillary thyroid sample use high resolution comparative genomic,e,Thyroid Cancer
"TLR-10 polymorphism and papillary thyroid cancer: one more SNP to consider? Activated toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway has been reported in several endocrine neoplasms and has been found to be associated with the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are widely known as critical mediators of tumorigenesis. The stimulation of antitumor immunity through the activation of the TLR pathway can lead to the inhibition of the carcinogenesis process. However, TLRs have been considered as putative therapeutic target in various human cancers. A chronic inflammation in the absence of infection induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and tissue damage promoting tumorigenesis. Thus, TLRs can be viewed as having a double-edged sword function. Accumulating evidences show the association between over-activation of TLR and cancer progression and TLRsignaling molecules are often involved in tumor progression. For example, TLR4 expression has been described in several human cancer, including intestinal [1], breast, and prostate cancers [2, 3] and TLR3 in papillary thyroid cancer and cervical carcinoma [4]. Several studies support that TLR activation via TLR-adaptors such as MyD88 induces NFkB translocation to the nucleus. This induces proinflammatory cytokine secretion (IL6 and IL1), antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-XL, cIAP1, ABL), as well as, pro-angiogenic factors expression (VEGF). High expression of TLR3 has been reported in a papillary thyroid cancer cell line which is consistent with its overexpression in human papillary thyroid cancer in vivo [5]. As one of the main mediator of lipopolysaccharide action, the lack or overexpression of TLR4 has also been associated with aggressive follicular thyroid cancers [6]. In this issue of Endocrine, Kim et al. [7] report that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TLR10 is associated with tumor size in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. TLR-1-TLR6-TLR-10 is located on the same chromosome and forms a cluster, and thus was the rationale for the authors to analyze these three TLR SNPs. They found that only a missense SNP in TLR10 (rs11466653, Met326Thr) showed a significant association with small tumor size (\1 cm). SNPs in the TLR-1-TLR6-TLR-10 cluster have been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer [8]. Altered TLR-10 signaling in papillary thyroid cancer may be involved in the interplay between inflammation and tumorigenesis. For example, it has been shown by several groups that IL-6, IL-1, and VEGFA are important cytokines in thyroid carcinogenesis [9–11]. Most importantly, common somatic mutations in papillary thyroid cancer such us RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF are involved in inflammation, where they have been shown to be involved in inflammatory response and in the infiltration of innate suppressive inflammatory cells in papillary thyroid cancer [12]. Thus, a cooperation of dysregulated TLR signaling pathway in the inflammatory response of microcarcinoma seems plausible. Based on our current knowledge, TLR-10 expression seems to be restricted to immune cells like B cells or dendritic cells. Lymphocytic and dendritic cell infiltration is higher in patients with papillary thyroid cancer as compared to those with benign thyroid tumors [13]. Thus, the missense TLR-10 SNP reported by Kim and colleagues may influence the amount of lymphocytic infiltration in patients with small papillary thyroid cancer.

"Compromised Outcome of Papillary Thyroid Cancer at Low-Volume Treatment Centers: Practice Makes Perfect? The intimate relationship between volume and outcome for nearly every major type of surgery is ubiquitous. Highvolume hospital care is associated with significantly lower mortality rates compared to low-volume hospitals. The effect of high surgeon volume accounts for the majority of the effect of high hospital volume in complex procedures. Nobel laureate and masterful Swiss surgeon Emil Theodor Kocher recognized the importance of surgical volume in improving outcomes in thyroid surgery. Kocher reported an operative mortality rate of 13 % for his first 100 thyroid procedures. By 1912, Kocher was able to reduce his mortality rate of thyroidectomy to less than 0.5 % after performing over 5000 thyroid excisions. He demonstrated a significant reduction in operative mortality with increasing experience. In the modern era, the association recognized by Kocher between provider volume and improved patient outcome has persisted. Reames et al. demonstrated that higher-volume hospitals had significantly lower mortality rates compared to lower-volume hospitals for eight different complex procedures in over 3 million patients. Data also show a significant relationship between surgeon volume and surgical morbidity in thyroid operations. Although the majority of thyroid operations are still performed by lowvolume surgeons, national trends in thyroid surgery over the last two decades exhibit an increase in thyroid surgical procedures performed by high-volume surgeons with a decrease in the incidence of complications, specifically recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypocalcemia. In addition, high-volume surgeons were more likely to perform total thyroidectomy and neck dissection as compared to low-volume surgeons. Hauch et al. evaluated the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003–2009) of all adult patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and unilateral thyroidectomy. They found that total thyroidectomy was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications compared to unilateral thyroidectomy in both lowand high-volume surgeons; however, higher surgeon volume was associated with improved patient outcome. Mitchell et al. demonstrated that operations for thyroid cancer led to avoidable reoperations more frequently if performed at low-volume centers. The initial operations requiring avoidable reoperations included errors in judgment concerning lymph node dissection or technical errors in incomplete thyroid resection. Furthermore, Schneider and colleagues found that higher-volume surgeons had better oncologic outcomes for thyroid cancer. In this issue, Youngwirth et al. report the first study examining margin status after total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer in the National Cancer Data Base (1998–2006). A total of 31,129 adult patients with thyroid cancer met the inclusion criterion of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. By multivariable analysis, the authors identified specific factors for patients with papillary thyroid cancer undergoing total thyroidectomy that led to a poor outcome in survival. These factors included patient factors (male gender, advanced age, African American race), socioeconomic factors (low income, government insurance), cancer stage (large tumor size, positive lymph nodes, distant metastases), absence of radioactive iodine treatment, and microscopically and macroscopically positive surgical margin status. Of these independent factors, which compromised patient survival, the authors recognized that only surgical margin status could be potentially controlled. They evaluated the factors associated with positive margin status in patients undergoing surgical resection for thyroid cancer.

"Analysis of the correlation between high iodized salt intake and the risk of thyroid nodules: a large retrospective study. BACKGROUND Currently, whether daily excess iodized salt intake increases the risk of thyroid nodules and even thyroid cancer remains controversial. Our research group aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical guidance of daily iodized salt intake and the prevention of thyroid nodules through a retrospective analysis of the correlation between daily iodized salt intake and the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in Hunan, China. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed the data of subjects who underwent a physical examination at the Health Management Center, Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Subjects enrolled in this study underwent thyroid ultrasonography and tests to urine routines and liver and kidney function, and all subjects completed a questionnaire survey. The daily iodized salt intake of the study subjects was estimated based on spot urine methods (Tanaka). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between daily iodized salt intake and thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. RESULTS Among the 51,637 subjects included in this study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules was 40.25%, and the prevalence of thyroid cancer was 0.76%; among all enrolled subjects, only 3.59% had a daily iodized salt intake less than 5 g. In addition, we found that a daily intake of more than 5 g of iodized salt was not only an independent risk factor for the occurrence of thyroid nodules (odds ratio (OR): 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.86-2.31, p   60 years with a daily iodized salt intake of more than 5 g compared to subjects aged  60 years with a daily iodized salt intake of more than 5 g and those aged < 60 years with a daily iodized salt intake of no more than 5 g (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 0.52-8.95, p = 0.281). The risk of thyroid nodules was not increased in physically active subjects with a daily iodized salt intake of more than 5 g compared to physically inactive subjects with a daily iodized salt intake of no more than 5 g (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.97-1.28, p = 0.111). The same protective effect of physical activity was observed for thyroid cancer in subjects whose daily iodized salt intake exceeded 5 g. The risk of thyroid nodules was reduced for subjects with an education level of postgraduate and above, even when the daily iodized salt intake exceeded 5 g, compared to those with high school education and below and a daily iodized salt intake of no more than 5 g (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.93, p = 0.005); however, a protective effect of education level on the occurrence of thyroid cancer was not observed. Independent risk factors affecting daily iodized salt intake greater than 5 g included age, triglycerides, family history of tumors, physical activity, and marital status. CONCLUSIONS Daily intake of more than 5 g of iodized salt increased the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer, while increased physical activity and education level reduced the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer caused by iodized salt intake.","analysis of the correlation between high iodized salt intake and the risk of thyroid nodules: a large retrospective study. background currently, whether daily excess iodized salt intake increases the risk of thyroid nodules and even thyroid cancer remains controversial. our research group aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical guidance of daily iodized salt intake and the prevention of thyroid nodules through a retrospective analysis of the correlation between daily iodized salt intake and the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in hunan, china. methods this study retrospectively analyzed the data of subjects who underwent a physical examination at the health management center, third xiangya hospital of central south university, between january 1, 2017, and december 31, 2019. subjects enrolled in this study underwent thyroid ultrasonography and tests to urine routines and liver and kidney function, and all subjects completed a questionnaire survey. the daily iodized salt",correlation high iodize salt intake risk thyroid nodule large retrospective currently whether daily excess iodize salt intake increase risk thyroid nodule even thyroid remain controversial research group provide theoretical basis guidance daily iodize salt intake prevention thyroid nodule retrospective correlation daily iodize salt intake risk thyroid nodule thyroid hunan china method retrospectively analyze data subject undergo physical examination health management center third xiangya hospital central south university january december subject enrol underwent thyroid ultrasonography test urine routine liver kidney function subject complete questionnaire survey daily iodized salt,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Picture of thyroid cancer in 2012 Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common tumour of the endocrine system. In Poland, the standardized incidence rate in 2010 was 6.7 for women, 1.5 for men and it is characterized by a constant increase. Patients with thyroid cancer make up a very heterogeneous group with a differential clinical course - from an indolent to a fast progressing which is the cause of a patient’s death.; ; As our studies indicate, in recent years papillary thyroid cancer with a diameter of less than 10 mm dominates among the cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Such situation requires the verification of the approach to the diagnostic process - moving the diagnostic burden from a palpable examination to an ultrasound method and indicating an outbreak to cytological and molecular examination. The open problem is reducing the diameter of lesions displayed in ultrasonography, which should be subjected to further assessment.; ; Surgical treatment with a total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection is a common procedure. Supplementary treatment with 131I has a documented value in the cases of advanced TC. Controversy arouses with the usage of 131I in patients with a lower stadium. The results of ESTIMABL and HiLo studies indicate high effectiveness of ablation with the use of an isotope with an activity of 30mCi, regardless of endogenous or exogenous TSH stimulation.; ; While monitoring the patients with DTC, the main tool is an ultrasound examination of a neck and thyroglobulin (TG) measurement. High hopes are connected with the use of ultrasensitive TG measurements under exogenous or endogenous TSH stimulation.; ; Isotope imaging is reserved only for patients with the suspicion of a relapse or metastases. To examinations used in these cases, a PET technique with the use of 124I or FDG was joined.; ; Due to a very differentiated clinical course of TC, prognostic indicators of worse prognoses requiring more aggressive measures are searched for. High expectations were connected with a BRAF mutation. Many studies have indicated that the BRAFV600E mutation can correlate with a more aggressive clinical course of papillary thyroid cancer and with a worse prognosis. The results of our studies seem not to confirm this opinion - the high mutation frequency (72.5%) in papillary thyroid cancer of very good prognosis with a diameter of less than 10 mm.; ; Recent years have brought new therapeutic possibilities for the patients with the spread of the disease and with the lack of iodine uptake.

"Molecular mechanism of thyroid hormone action in carcinogenesis Thyroid hormones, 3,5,3'5'-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) contribute to the regulation of key cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. Thus, deregulation of thyroid hormone pathway can result in serious disturbances of cellular physiology such as those observed in tumoral transformation. The intra- and extracellular concentrations of thyroid hormones (TH) are regulated by three types of iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3). These enzymes catalyze two types of reactions: deiodination in position 5' of iodothyronines (catalyzed by DIO1 and DIO2), resulting in activation of thyroid hormones, and deiodination in position 5 of iodothyronines (catalyzed by DIO1 and DIO3), which results in inactivation of thyroid hormones. Changes in expression and activity of iodothyronine deiodinases result in modulations of thyroid hormone concentrations and thus influence cellular processes. The actions of thyroid hormone are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) which influence intracellular processes via modulation of expression of target genes. In this process, known as genomic mechanism of TH action, thyroid hormone receptors act as transcription factors whose activity is modulated by the presence of ligand, T3. TH can also influence cellular processes via non-genomic pathways in which TH modulate activity of membrane or intracellular receptors and activate different intracellular signaling pathways, involving protein kinases, for instance PI3K, and Akt/PKB.; ; In the process of carcinogenesis the signaling pathway of thyroid hormones is disturbed. This is illustrated by observations of mutations and deregulated expression of thyroid hormone receptors, altered expression and activity of iodothyronine deiodinases as well as decreased intracellular concentrations of T3 in tumours. Whether these changes play a causative role in the process of carcinogenesis is currently a matter of discussion. In vitro studies in cancer cell lines and mouse models showed that increased expression of DIO3 together with enhanced proteasomal degradation of DIO2 in basal cell carcinoma stimulates tumoral proliferation. Moreover, thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 was shown to act as a powerful suppressor of tumour invasiveness and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer and hepatocarcinoma. These studies suggest that local tissue hypothyroidism may rather support tumoral transformation and even initiate enhanced cancerous proliferation. In contrast, studies on the effects of systemic hypothyroidism and cancer risk show opposite or conflicting results. For instance, hypothyroidism was associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and cancers of lung and prostate. In case of breast cancer, different studies reported that hypothyroidism was linked to reduced risk of the disease in humans while when studied in mice, hypothyroidism reduced tumour growth but enhanced metastasis. Finally, studies performed on cell line and mouse xenografts of thyroid and kidney cancers showed that inhibition of integrin-mediated thyroid hormone signaling can effectively result in inhibition of tumour growth.; ; All these studies show that the role of thyroid hormones in carcinogenic process is complex and presumably depends on type of cancer and extra- or intracellular effects of TH signaling. The results showing benefits from the use of TH pathway genes in cancer treatment and diagnosis suggest that further and more in depth studies are needed.","molecular mechanism of thyroid hormone action in carcinogenesis thyroid hormones, 3,5,3'5'-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (t3) contribute to the regulation of key cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. thus, deregulation of thyroid hormone pathway can result in serious disturbances of cellular physiology such as those observed in tumoral transformation. the intra- and extracellular concentrations of thyroid hormones (th) are regulated by three types of iodothyronine deiodinases (dio1, dio2, and dio3). these enzymes catalyze two types of reactions: deiodination in position 5' of iodothyronines (catalyzed by dio1 and dio2), resulting in activation of thyroid hormones, and deiodination in position 5 of iodothyronines (catalyzed by dio1 and dio3), which results in inactivation of thyroid hormones. changes in expression and activity of iodothyronine deiodinases result in modulations of thyroid hormone concentrations and thus influence cellular processes. the actions of thyroid hormone are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (trs) which influence intracellular processes",molecular mechanism thyroid hormone action carcinogenesis thyroid hormone tetraiodothyronine thyroxine triiodothyronine contribute regulation key cellular process include proliferation differentiation apoptosis metabolism thus deregulation thyroid hormone pathway result serious disturbance cellular physiology observe tumoral transformation intra extracellular concentration thyroid hormone th regulate three type iodothyronine deiodinases dio dio dio enzyme catalyze two type reaction deiodination position iodothyronine catalyze dio dio resulting activation thyroid hormone deiodination position iodothyronine catalyze dio dio result inactivation thyroid hormone change expression activity iodothyronine deiodinases result modulation thyroid hormone concentration thus influence cellular process action thyroid hormone mediate thyroid hormone receptor trs influence intracellular process,e,Thyroid Cancer
"A novel long non-coding RNA, PICSAR, promotes thyroid cancer progression through the hsa-miR-320A/hsa-miR-485/RAPGEFL1 axis. Among endocrine cancers, thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most prevalent and ranks sixth in global mortality rates. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) is associated with the progression of various human cancers, including TC. The role of PICSAR lncRNA (LINC00162) has been validated in different human cancers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the expression levels and functions of lncRNA PICSAR in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis. This comprehensive approach combined in silico and in vitro methods to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of PICSAR in thyroid cancer. This work assessed the expression of the long non-coding RNA LINC00162 and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Interactions among LINC00162, hsa-miR-320A, hsa-miR-485, and RAPGEFL1 were investigated using the LncACT and miRDB databases. Bioinformatics techniques were employed to conduct functional enrichment analysis to clarify the relevant molecular pathways. For the investigation of LINC00162 expression in TC samples, 50 matched samples of thyroid carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue were gathered. Real time PCR was used to objectively evaluate the expression levels of the targeted genes. Every tissue sample was examined pathologically. A specific siRNA was transfected into a thyroid cancer cell line to examine the functional role of LINC00162. The impact of LINC00162 silencing was then assessed by measuring the level of target genes expression following the transfection. Based on TCGA-THCA analysis and qRT-PCR on tissue samples, LINC00162 (PICSAR) was markedly overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues compared to normal samples. However, no discernible correlation was found between LINC00162 expression and the pathological characteristics of thyroid cancer. Our bioinformatics predictions based on lncRNA-microRNA interactions demonstrate that LINC00162 acts as a molecular sponge for the downregulated microRNAs hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485 in thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1, a gene associated with the development of thyroid cancer, is upregulated in conjunction with this downregulation. The LINC00162-miRNA-RAPGEFL1 axis is involved in critical carcinogenic processes, including thiamine metabolism, cell cycle control, and folate biosynthesis, according to functional enrichment analysis. Additionally, a bioinformatics study revealed a negative association between PICSAR and the NUDT3 gene, while a positive correlation was found with the SNX18P14 gene. Thyroid cancer cells transfected with LINC00162-specific siRNA showed significant downregulation of LINC00162 and RAPGEFL1, alongside an increase in hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, ultimately inhibiting the growth of thyroid cancer. These findings suggest that targeting PICSAR may offer a treatment strategy for thyroid cancer by altering important biological processes. In conclusion, LINC00162, which is overexpressed in thyroid cancer, acts as a molecular sponge for hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, regulating key oncogenic pathways and leading to the upregulation of RAPGEFL1. These effects are reversed upon siRNA-mediated silencing of LINC00162, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1 regulates the Rap signaling pathway, controlling adhesion, migration, polarity, and metabolism to maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis. Its dysregulation is linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.","a novel long non-coding rna, picsar, promotes thyroid cancer progression through the hsa-mir-320a/hsa-mir-485/rapgefl1 axis. among endocrine cancers, thyroid carcinoma (tc) is the most prevalent and ranks sixth in global mortality rates. aberrant expression of long non-coding rna (lncrnas) is associated with the progression of various human cancers, including tc. the role of picsar lncrna (linc00162) has been validated in different human cancers. therefore, this study aimed to assess the expression levels and functions of lncrna picsar in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis. this comprehensive approach combined in silico and in vitro methods to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of picsar in thyroid cancer. this work assessed the expression of the long non-coding rna linc00162 and identified differentially expressed genes (degs) using the cancer genome atlas (tcga) database. interactions among linc00162, hsa-mir-320a, hsa-mir-485, and rapgefl1 were investigated using the lncact and mirdb databases. bioinformatics techniques were employed to conduct functional enrichment",novel long non cod rna picsar promote thyroid progression hsa mir hsa mir rapgefl axis among endocrine thyroid carcinoma tc prevalent rank sixth global mortality rate aberrant expression long non cod rna lncrnas associate progression various human include tc role picsar lncrna linc validate different human therefore assess expression level function lncrna picsar thyroid tumorigenesis comprehensive approach combine silico vitro method explore molecular mechanism significance picsar thyroid work assess expression long non cod rna linc identify differentially express gene degs use genome atlas tcga database interaction among linc hsa mir hsa mir rapgefl investigate use lncact mirdb database bioinformatics technique employ conduct functional enrichment,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Effects of Aerobic Exercises Combined With Music Therapy on Fatigue and Quality of Life in Females With Thyroidectomy Following Thyroid Cancer: An Experimental Study. Background Thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the thyroid gland. Thyroid cancer is characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells within the thyroid gland. In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been rising globally, with a significant increase observed in India. It is more prevalent among females, who are three times more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer than males. According to recent statistics, thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 4%-6% of all cancers among Indian women, with an estimated incidence rate of 8.7 per 100,000 women. Thyroidectomy is a technique performed to manage thyroid cancer. Females who undergo thyroidectomy and receive insufficient levothyroxine supplementation are more prone to experience problems such as fatigue, which can significantly affect their quality of life (QoL). Fatigue is a prevalent and discomforting symptom among oncology patients, though its prevalence can vary depending on cancer type, stage, and treatment. Exercise is becoming widely recognized as a management strategy for fatigue and for enhancing QoL. This study aims to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise and music therapy on fatigue and QoL in females who have undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer. Fatigue will be measured using the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), while QoL will be assessed through the RAND SF-36 Questionnaire. The study seeks to determine how these combined interventions may help improve both physical and mental well-being in this population. Method The study was conducted in the physiotherapy outpatient department of Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital over a duration of six months, using an experimental interventional design. A total of 30 female participants, all of whom have undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer, were selected through a simple random sampling method with allocation based on a computer-generated list. Female participants will ensure completion of the six-week session. As interventions, both aerobic exercises and music therapy were combined. The RAND SF-36 Questionnaire and FAS were utilized to examine QoL and fatigue levels before and after treatment. The student-paired t-test was applied to compare pre- and post-treatment outcomes. Result  Following six weeks of interventions, the fatigue symptom was reduced, resulting in a considerable enhancement in QoL. Post-intervention the FAS (t=13.37, p=0.0001) and RAND SF-36 (t=14.09, p=0.0001) scores improved more significantly. The level of significance was found to be p<0.0001. Conclusion Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the combination of aerobic exercises and music therapy has a positive impact on the QoL of females who have undergone thyroidectomy. Additionally, these interventions were found to effectively reduce fatigue symptoms in this population. These results underscore the potential benefits of integrating aerobic exercises and music therapy into post-thyroidectomy care strategies for enhancing overall well-being.","effects of aerobic exercises combined with music therapy on fatigue and quality of life in females with thyroidectomy following thyroid cancer: an experimental study. background thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the thyroid gland. thyroid cancer is characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells within the thyroid gland. in recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been rising globally, with a significant increase observed in india. it is more prevalent among females, who are three times more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer than males. according to recent statistics, thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 4%-6% of all cancers among indian women, with an estimated incidence rate of 8.7 per 100,000 women. thyroidectomy is a technique performed to manage thyroid cancer. females who undergo thyroidectomy and receive insufficient levothyroxine supplementation are more prone to experience problems such as fatigue, which can significantly affect their",effect aerobic exercise combine music therapy fatigue quality life female thyroidectomy follow thyroid experimental thyroid type start thyroid gland thyroid characterize abnormal uncontrolled growth cell within thyroid gland recent year incidence thyroid rise globally significant increase observe india prevalent among female three time likely diagnose thyroid male accord recent statistic thyroid constitute approximately among indian woman estimate incidence rate per woman thyroidectomy technique perform manage thyroid female undergo thyroidectomy receive insufficient levothyroxine supplementation prone experience problem fatigue significantly affect,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Low-risk thyroid cancer, surgical training, and radioactive iodine. Michigan have undertaken an interesting and complex study of surgeon training and use of radioactive iodine for low risk thyroid cancer patients. This study is based on several hypotheses, a questionnaire to the surgeons and correlating their training to radioactive iodine use. Clearly, management of thyroid cancer starting from extent of thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine use and extent of suppressive therapy continue to be a controversial subject and depends on experience and judgment of the treating physician. Even though there are no firm standards of practice, the general tendency in the United States appears to be total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation. Some of these decisions are made definitely by surgeons who have performed the surgical procedure; however, there is an enormous impact of endocrinologists, and the patient themselves having read extensively on Google. Clearly, trying to correlate these issues of treatment, referring specifically to the surgeon training, parent specialty, and attending the professional meeting may be difficult. In any case, the authors have made a genuine effort to correlate these issues and concluded that training with a thyroid surgeon and attending one or more professional society meeting a year was associated with lower rate of hospital based RAI use. Clearly, these conclusions may be difficult to digest because decision making regarding RAI is generally not one individual decision. The manuscript mentions Stage I thyroid cancer patients while a majority of the manuscript discusses the low risk thyroid cancer patients. Clearly, Stage I thyroid cancer patients, especially below the age of 45 with lymph node metastasis, definitely will require radioactive iodine and is quite rational approach, while in the truly low risk thyroid cancer patient, where the tumor appears to be intrathyroidal, the role of radioactive iodine is always questioned and similar opinion is reflected in the ATA guidelines. The basic conclusion that can be made out of this manuscript is the surgeon training, and the experience of the surgeon is more important in treatment policies. Having read this manuscript several times, certain important points need to be highlighted. The collection of the data and its relation to NCDB is quite complex. It should be mentioned that the average surgeon age was 51 years and the surgeon’s average years in practice was 19. This reflects the seniority of the surgeons and their training several years before the ATA guidelines and our recent multidisciplinary management of thyroid cancer. The practice distribution of thyroidectomy is also quite interesting that the general surgeons comprised of 39 %","low-risk thyroid cancer, surgical training, and radioactive iodine. michigan have undertaken an interesting and complex study of surgeon training and use of radioactive iodine for low risk thyroid cancer patients. this study is based on several hypotheses, a questionnaire to the surgeons and correlating their training to radioactive iodine use. clearly, management of thyroid cancer starting from extent of thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine use and extent of suppressive therapy continue to be a controversial subject and depends on experience and judgment of the treating physician. even though there are no firm standards of practice, the general tendency in the united states appears to be total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation. some of these decisions are made definitely by surgeons who have performed the surgical procedure; however, there is an enormous impact of endocrinologists, and the patient themselves having read extensively on google. clearly, trying to correlate these issues of treatment,",low risk thyroid surgical training radioactive iodine michigan undertake interesting complex surgeon training use radioactive iodine low risk thyroid base several hypothesis questionnaire surgeon correlate training radioactive iodine use clearly management thyroid start extent thyroidectomy radioactive iodine use extent suppressive therapy continue controversial subject depend experience judgment treating physician even though firm standard practice general tendency united state appear total thyroidectomy follow radioactive iodine ablation decision make definitely surgeon perform surgical procedure however enormous impact endocrinologist read extensively google clearly try correlate issue,e,Thyroid Cancer
"P53 mutations in thyroid carcinoma: tidings from an old foe. The underlying mechanism leading to carcinogenesis involves genomic instability, likely related to aneuploidy. While p53 as a “guardian of the genome” is an appealing candidate as an initiator of genomic instability, its mutations or deletions usually occur late in the course of tumor progression. P53 may, however, become a target of events initiated by genomic instability. P53 is a transcription factor with multifaceted regulatory functions in the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. Inactivating p53 mutations have been described in some 50% of human cancers. These mutations are not only important in tumor progression but apparently also in the response of some tumors to chemotherapy and radiation treatment, thus to clinical outcome. P53 mutations are found in 14% of malignant thyroid tumors and are more frequent in poorly differentiated and anaplastic tumors. We have examined the mutation rates of p53 as a measure of genomic instability (hypermutability) of malignant thyroid tumors. We also wondered whether radiation enhances this tendency to genomic instability. To those ends we extracted all available entries from the p53 mutations database (http://www.perso@curies.fr), verified, extended where applicable, and supplemented that information from the original published reports. We were able to locate 100 entries. The distribution of the types of p53 aberrations in thyroid cancer was similar to those in the database as a whole. The silent mutation rate of 20%, not different from the expected 25%, is consistent with a random occurrence of these mutations. This silent mutation rate is 130 times that expected and is 7 times that of the p53 database. Moreover the distribution of p53 mutations is compatible with Poisson’s distribution, which, when considered in the context of the silent mutation rates, indicates that p53 is particularly hypermutable in thyroid cancer. Epigenetic deamination of CpG dinucleotides at highly transforming DNA-contact residues is a feature of poorly differentiated tumors and thus associated with tumor progression. The rates of p53 mutations in radiation-related thyroid cancers (15.4%) are similar to those in spontaneously arising tumors, although there was a highly significant heterogeneity (p<0.0005) in the residues mutated in the two tumor sets. None of the residues mutated in radiation-related thyroid cancer involved CpG deamination. Based on the evidence of p53 hypermutability, thyroid cancer appears to exhibit remarkable genomic instability. Spontaneous epigenetic mutational events are involved in tumor progression. While thyroid cancer related to radiation exposure does not increase the rates of p53 mutation, they exhibit mutation at residues not involved in p53/DNA interface.","p53 mutations in thyroid carcinoma: tidings from an old foe. the underlying mechanism leading to carcinogenesis involves genomic instability, likely related to aneuploidy. while p53 as a “guardian of the genome” is an appealing candidate as an initiator of genomic instability, its mutations or deletions usually occur late in the course of tumor progression. p53 may, however, become a target of events initiated by genomic instability. p53 is a transcription factor with multifaceted regulatory functions in the cell cycle, dna repair and apoptosis. inactivating p53 mutations have been described in some 50% of human cancers. these mutations are not only important in tumor progression but apparently also in the response of some tumors to chemotherapy and radiation treatment, thus to clinical outcome. p53 mutations are found in 14% of malignant thyroid tumors and are more frequent in poorly differentiated and anaplastic tumors. we have examined the mutation rates of p53",p mutation thyroid carcinoma tidings old foe underlie mechanism lead carcinogenesis involves genomic instability likely relate aneuploidy p guardian genome appeal candidate initiator genomic instability mutation deletion usually occur late course progression p may however become target event initiate genomic instability p transcription factor multifaceted regulatory function cell cycle dna repair apoptosis inactivate p mutation describe human mutation important progression apparently also response chemotherapy radiation thus outcome p mutation find malignant thyroid frequent poorly differentiate anaplastic examine mutation rate p,e,Thyroid Cancer
"A gene-disease association study of IL18 in thyroid cancer: genotype and haplotype analyses Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, and genetic factors have been shown to be associated with its risk. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces IFN-γ production and is involved in T helper type 1 development. To determine the role of IL-18 gene in thyroid cancer susceptibility, we conducted a case–control study, and genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-18 gene (−656 G/T (rs1946519), −607 C/A (rs1946518), and −137 G/C (rs187238) in the promoter region and +113 T/G (rs360718) and +127 C/T (rs360717) in 5′-untranslated region) in 105 patients with thyroid cancer and 148 healthy controls from Iranian population. Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) and allele-specific primer-PCR were used for genotyping. The association of different genotypes with thyroid cancer, tumor type, and the tumor stage was analyzed. Comparing all of the patient population with the controls, TT genotype at position −656 G/T was observed to be associated with a significantly increased risk of thyroid cancer [31/105 (30.1 %) vs 19/148 (13.1 %), p = 0.002, OR 2.90, CI 1.40–5.70]. No association with thyroid cancer was found at other positions (−607 C/A, −137 G/C, +113 T/G, and +127 C/T). Excluding the patients with medullary carcinoma, and including only the ones with thyroid cancer derived from the follicular epithelium, nearly the same results were observed regarding the genotypes at position −656 G/T. Furthermore, significantly decreased risk of thyroid cancer derived from the follicular epithelium was observed upon inheritance of the homozygote genotype (CC) at position +127 C/T (40/94 (42.5 %) versus 84/148 (56.8 %) in patients and controls, respectively (OR 0.56, 95 % CI for OR 0.32–0.98, p = 0.04). Haplotype analysis indicated that among 32 possible haplotypes, TAGTT haplotype frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls [12/188 (6.4 %) vs 2/292 (0.7 %), p = 0.0008] and this difference resisted Bonferroni correction (n = 19) and significant level set at 0.003. Nearly the same results were observed after excluding the patients with medullary carcinoma. No association was found between the SNPs and the stage of tumor. Our results suggest the increased susceptibility to thyroid cancer in subjects with TT genotype at position −656 G/T of the promoter of IL-18 gene, as well as TAGTT haplotype emerged from five studied SNPs in IL-18 gene. The data also suggest that the inheritance of +127 CC genotype may protect individuals from thyroid cancer derived from follicular epithelium.","a gene-disease association study of il18 in thyroid cancer: genotype and haplotype analyses thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, and genetic factors have been shown to be associated with its risk. interleukin-18 (il-18) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces ifn-γ production and is involved in t helper type 1 development. to determine the role of il-18 gene in thyroid cancer susceptibility, we conducted a case–control study, and genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in il-18 gene (−656 g/t (rs1946519), −607 c/a (rs1946518), and −137 g/c (rs187238) in the promoter region and +113 t/g (rs360718) and +127 c/t (rs360717) in 5′-untranslated region) in 105 patients with thyroid cancer and 148 healthy controls from iranian population. polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr–rflp) and allele-specific primer-pcr were used for genotyping. the association of different genotypes with thyroid cancer, tumor type, and the tumor stage was analyzed.",gene association il thyroid genotype haplotype thyroid common malignancy endocrine system genetic factor show associate risk interleukin il pleiotropic pro inflammatory cytokine induce ifn production involve helper type development determine role il gene thyroid susceptibility conduct control genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphism snps il gene g r c r g c r promoter region g r c r untranslated region thyroid healthy control iranian population polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr rflp allele specific primer pcr use genotyping association different genotype thyroid type stage analyze,e,Thyroid Cancer

However, there has not been any comprehensive studies with a large number of patients and long-term follow-up in our country. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the results of treatment by TOETVA for benign and malignant lesions of thyroid gland in Viet Nam. A prospective study was performed on 326 eligible patients who underwent TOETVA due to thyroid cancer and benign thyroid nodules in Department of Oncology and Palliative Care, Hanoi Medical University Hospital from July 2018 to April 2021. The clinical, surgical, and pathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and visual analog scale (VAS, 0–10 cm) score in day 1, 4, and 7 after surgery, long-term oncological and surgical outcomes were recorded.

"Recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone: pharmacology, clinical applications and potential uses. The major functions of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are to maintain the biosynthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones L-thyroxine (T4) and L-3,5,3'triidothyronine (T3). The TSH core contains two apoproteins, the alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is identical to that of pituitary follitropin, pituitary lutropin and placental chorionic gonadotropin, whereas the beta subunit is unique. TSH is a glycoprotein; the glycoprotein components of the alpha and beta subunits account for more than 10% of their mass and are essential for normal thyrotropic action and intravascular kinetics. The hypothalamic tripeptide, TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) is required for optimum TSH biosynthesis, particularly as far as addition of the glycoprotein components is concerned. TRH deficiency is associated with secretion of TSH molecules that are appropriately measured in most assays but have reduced bioactivity. In previous years the TSH used in clinical practice was obtained and purified from bovine pituitaries. Bovine TSH was used to test thyroid function and to augment the uptake of radioiodine in patients with thyroid cancer. Bovine TSH has been largely abandoned as a clinical agent because of adverse immune reactions. A recombinant human TSH (rhTSH; Thyrogen), has been approved by the US FDA for diagnostic use in patients with thyroid cancer. The alpha and beta subunits of Thyrogen are identical to those of human pituitary TSH. Thyrogen has a specific activity of approximately 4 IU/mg and is a potent stimulator of T4, T3 and thyroglobulin (Tg) secretion in healthy volunteers. It also increases thyroid iodide uptake in patients with thyroid cancer or multinodular goitre and in volunteers, even those exposed to large amounts of stable iodide. Thyroid cancer patients who have been treated by thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation but are at risk of harbouring residual thyroid cancer are candidates for Thyrogen administration to prepare them for whole body iodide scans and serum Tg measurements. In thyroidectomised thyroid cancer patients who are unable to secrete pituitary TSH upon thyroid hormone withdrawal, Thyrogen is the only acceptable method to prepare them for these procedures. Thyrogen has been used on a compassionate basis to prepare patients for radioiodine ablation. rhTSH, in addition to being useful in the management of patients with thyroid cancer, is potentially useful to test thyroid reserve and to aid in thyroid-related nuclear medicine procedures. In the future, TSH analogues that have superagonist or antagonist properties may become available as therapeutic agents.","recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone: pharmacology, clinical applications and potential uses. the major functions of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) are to maintain the biosynthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones l-thyroxine (t4) and l-3,5,3'triidothyronine (t3). the tsh core contains two apoproteins, the alpha and beta subunits. the alpha subunit is identical to that of pituitary follitropin, pituitary lutropin and placental chorionic gonadotropin, whereas the beta subunit is unique. tsh is a glycoprotein; the glycoprotein components of the alpha and beta subunits account for more than 10% of their mass and are essential for normal thyrotropic action and intravascular kinetics. the hypothalamic tripeptide, tsh-releasing hormone (trh) is required for optimum tsh biosynthesis, particularly as far as addition of the glycoprotein components is concerned. trh deficiency is associated with secretion of tsh molecules that are appropriately measured in most assays but have reduced bioactivity. in previous years the tsh used in clinical practice",recombinant human thyroid stimulate hormone pharmacology application potential use major function pituitary thyroid stimulate hormone tsh maintain biosynthesis secretion thyroid hormone l thyroxine l triidothyronine tsh core contain two apoproteins alpha beta subunit alpha subunit identical pituitary follitropin pituitary lutropin placental chorionic gonadotropin whereas beta subunit unique tsh glycoprotein glycoprotein component alpha beta subunit account mass essential normal thyrotropic action intravascular kinetics hypothalamic tripeptide tsh release hormone trh require optimum tsh biosynthesis particularly far addition glycoprotein component concern trh deficiency associate secretion tsh molecule appropriately measure assay reduce bioactivity previous year tsh use practice,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Expression of ANGPTL2 and its impact on papillary thyroid cancer Although the most thyroid carcinoma patients have good prognosis, around 20% of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients have a high rate of metastasis and recurrence after routine treatment, which causes high lethality with these patients. Tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion are important predictors of PTC invasiveness and are key factors in cancer-related death. Angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2), a secreted protein which belongs to the angiopoietin (ANGPTL) family, was reported to be involved in the regulation of several different type of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, whether ANGPTL2 plays a role in the progression of PTC, particularly in metastasis and recurrence of PTC, remains unclear. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of ANGPTL2 in PTC and normal thyroid, as well as para-cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the impact of ANGPTL2 on PTC cell proliferation, metastasis, recurrence and invasion was assessed to investigate the possibility whether ANGPTL2 may become a novel target for PTC therapy and cancer prognosis. The level of ANGPTL2 in PTC and para-cancerous tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The biological effect of ANGPTL2 on thyroid cancer cell proliferation and metastasis was investigated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, cell scratch test, and transwell assay. Correlations of ANGPTL2 expression levels with proliferation, migration, and metastasis of thyroid cancer were assessed with the TCGA data set and analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the utility of ANGPTL2 as a biomarker for prediction of thyroid cancer. Survival analysis was performed using the thyroid cancer database in K–M Plotter to detect correlations between survival time and ANGPTL2 levels. Current study revealed that: (1) ANGPTL2 was highly expressed in thyroid cancer in comparison with adjacent normal thyroid tissue; (2) ANGPTL2 expression was increased with thyroid tumor progression; (3) ANGPTL2 increased proliferation of thyroid cancer cells; (4) ANGPTL2 promoted migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells; (5) high level of ANGPTL2 in thyroid cancer patients were significantly associated with a poor prognosis. The patients showed a higher metastasis and recurrence rate. ANGPTL2 promoted and enhanced proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. ANGPTL2 may be considered as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer patients. Further evaluation needs to be done to analyze the possibility of taking ANGPTL2 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for papillary thyroid cancer.","expression of angptl2 and its impact on papillary thyroid cancer although the most thyroid carcinoma patients have good prognosis, around 20% of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) patients have a high rate of metastasis and recurrence after routine treatment, which causes high lethality with these patients. tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion are important predictors of ptc invasiveness and are key factors in cancer-related death. angiopoietin-like 2 (angptl2), a secreted protein which belongs to the angiopoietin (angptl) family, was reported to be involved in the regulation of several different type of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. however, whether angptl2 plays a role in the progression of ptc, particularly in metastasis and recurrence of ptc, remains unclear. hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of angptl2 in ptc and normal thyroid, as well as para-cancerous tissue. furthermore, the impact of angptl2 on ptc cell proliferation, metastasis, recurrence and invasion",expression angptl impact papillary thyroid although thyroid carcinoma good prognosis around papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc high rate metastasis recurrence routine cause high lethality proliferation metastasis invasion important predictor ptc invasiveness key factor relate death angiopoietin like angptl secrete protein belong angiopoietin angptl family report involve regulation several different type cell proliferation metastasis however whether angptl play role progression ptc particularly metastasis recurrence ptc remain unclear hence evaluate level angptl ptc normal thyroid well para cancerous tissue furthermore impact angptl ptc cell proliferation metastasis recurrence invasion,e,Thyroid Cancer

This observational cohort study enrolled patients between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016 with a follow-up until December 31, 2018. This study analyzed the data of Taiwanese thyroid cancer patients registered on the National Taiwan Cancer Registry Database, with CHD and IS. SIR models were used to evaluate the association between thyroid cancer and CHD, IS, AF, and cardiovascular disease outcome, stratified by age and sex. SIR analyses were also conducted for both sexes, age groups (< 65, ≥ 65 years), and different follow-up years. After excluding 128 individuals (< 20 years or ≥ 85 years old) and with missing index data, 4274 eligible thyroid cancer patients without CHD history, 4343 patients without IS history, and 4247 patients without AF history were included for analysis. During the median follow-up of 3.5 (1.2) years among thyroid cancer patients, the observed number of new CHD events was 70; IS, 30; and AF, 20, respectively.

"Molecular detection of circulating thyroid specific transcripts (TSHR/Tg-mRNAs) in thyroid cancer patients: Their diagnostic significance Abstract Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. The preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that relies solely on fine-needle aspiration (FNAC) biopsy, sometimes possesses conflicting results. New molecular markers for thyroid cancer have been investigated with most of them based on the detection in thyroid nodules or tumor tissue specimens. Recently, it was possible to detect thyroid cancer cells in the circulation by measuring the mRNA of thyroid specific genes. Among these, thyroglobulin and more recently thyroid stimulating hormone receptor mRNAs, TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood might serve as cancer-specific markers. These have become promising new circulating markers for thyroid cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess TSHR/Tg-mRNAs as diagnostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer and if they can be used preoperatively in synergy with FNAC. This study was performed on 60 subjects; 20 healthy volunteers and 40 patients; including 16 patients with benign thyroid diseases, 24 patients with thyroid cancer; 18 patients with newly diagnosed (DTC) and 6 patients with recurrent thyroid cancer. Diagnosis of cancer was based on FNAC and histopathology of surgical specimens. All subjects had TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood measured by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Based on cytology/pathology; 18 patients had newly diagnosed DTC and 11 had benign thyroid disease. Preoperative FNAC was performed on 29 of 40 patients; FNAC was diagnostic in 11/18 of malignant lesions (61.1%), in 8/11 of benign lesions (72.7%), while 10/29 (34.5%) were indeterminate. TSHR/Tg-mRNAs correctly diagnosed DTC in 20/24 and 19/24 (sensitivity 83.3% and 79.1%) and benign disease in 14/16 and 13/16 (specificity 87.5% and 81.3%), respectively. With indeterminate FNA, TSHR/Tg-mRNAs correctly diagnosed DTC (follicular type) in 5/7 and benign disease in 2/3 (combined sensitivity 71.4%; specificity 66.7%). There was high concordance between RT-PCR results for TSHR-mRNA and Tg-mRNA. Of the controls 19/20 (95%) and 16/20 (80%) were negative for both TSHR- and Tg-mRNAs. With the use of a carefully selected primer pair and qualitative RT-PCR; our results indicate that TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood are both equally sensitive and specific markers for detection of thyroid cancer cells. Combining TSHR/Tg-mRNAs and FNAC and ultrasound enhances the preoperative detection of cancer in patients with thyroid nodules, reducing unnecessary surgeries and correctly classified most follicular cancers and could have spared surgery in patients with benign disease.","molecular detection of circulating thyroid specific transcripts (tshr/tg-mrnas) in thyroid cancer patients: their diagnostic significance abstract thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. the preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) that relies solely on fine-needle aspiration (fnac) biopsy, sometimes possesses conflicting results. new molecular markers for thyroid cancer have been investigated with most of them based on the detection in thyroid nodules or tumor tissue specimens. recently, it was possible to detect thyroid cancer cells in the circulation by measuring the mrna of thyroid specific genes. among these, thyroglobulin and more recently thyroid stimulating hormone receptor mrnas, tshr/tg-mrnas in peripheral blood might serve as cancer-specific markers. these have become promising new circulating markers for thyroid cancer. the purpose of this study is to assess tshr/tg-mrnas as diagnostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer and if they can be used preoperatively in synergy with fnac. this study was performed on",molecular detection circulate thyroid specific transcript tshr tg mrna thyroid diagnostic significance abstract thyroid prevalent endocrine malignancy preoperative diagnosis differentiated thyroid dtc rely solely fine needle aspiration fnac biopsy sometimes possess conflict result new molecular marker thyroid investigate base detection thyroid nodule tissue specimens recently possible detect thyroid cell circulation measure mrna thyroid specific gene among thyroglobulin recently thyroid stimulate hormone receptor mrna tshr tg mrna peripheral blood might serve specific marker become promising new circulate marker thyroid assess tshr tg mrna diagnostic molecular marker thyroid use preoperatively synergy fnac perform,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Papillary thyroid cancer: medical management and follow-up. The incidence of epithelial derived thyroid cancer (papillary thyroid cancer [PTC] and follicular thyroid cancer, known collectively as differentiated thyroid cancer) is rising. About 80% of patients with thyroid cancer have PTC and are best treated with thyroid-ectomy and functional lymph node dissection, followed by radioiodine ablation or therapy and performance of a posttreatment whole-body scan, followed by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression. One year after radioiodine administration, the use of sensitive thyroglobulin (Tg) assays can separate the vast majority of patients with persistent disease from those who are free of disease and unlikely to have recurrent disease all without the need for repeat whole-body radioiodine imaging. Patients with detectable serum Tg during TSH suppression (Tg-on) or Tg that rises above 2 ng/mL after TSH stimulation (TSH-Tg) are highly likely to harbor residual tumor. TSH stimulation can be achieved using either thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human TSH (rhTSH). Highly skilled screening neck ultrasonography can identify a few additional patients with subcentimeter residual neck lymph node metastases not detected by TSH-Tg. However, ultrasonography and chest computed tomography (CT) are most critical for tumor localization in those patients with Tg values that suggest residual disease or in those patients with persistent antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) that falsely lower Tg measurement. TgAb quantitative titers typically resolve steadily over just a few years in patients free of disease after initial therapy. Another paradigm shift is the recognition that most patients who eventually achieve freedom from disease do so by surgery with fewer patients cured by repetitive radioiodine treatments, and even fewer cured with external beam radiation. Patients who appear to be free of disease require a lifetime of follow-up to optimize levothyroxine treatment, and they will undergo periodic stimulation testing because some will still manifest recurrent disease. Patients with persistent disease despite negative ultrasonography, chest CT, and whole-body radioiodine imaging may have a tumor identified by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, optimally performed with combined TSH stimulation and image fusion with CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with metastatic disease who are unresponsive to conventional treatment are encouraged to participate in increasingly available thyroid cancer-specific clinical trials using targeted experimental oral or intravenous chemotherapeutic agents to address this tumor that has historically proven resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.","papillary thyroid cancer: medical management and follow-up. the incidence of epithelial derived thyroid cancer (papillary thyroid cancer [ptc] and follicular thyroid cancer, known collectively as differentiated thyroid cancer) is rising. about 80% of patients with thyroid cancer have ptc and are best treated with thyroid-ectomy and functional lymph node dissection, followed by radioiodine ablation or therapy and performance of a posttreatment whole-body scan, followed by thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) suppression. one year after radioiodine administration, the use of sensitive thyroglobulin (tg) assays can separate the vast majority of patients with persistent disease from those who are free of disease and unlikely to have recurrent disease all without the need for repeat whole-body radioiodine imaging. patients with detectable serum tg during tsh suppression (tg-on) or tg that rises above 2 ng/ml after tsh stimulation (tsh-tg) are highly likely to harbor residual tumor. tsh stimulation can be achieved using either thyroid hormone",papillary thyroid medical management follow incidence epithelial derive thyroid papillary thyroid ptc follicular thyroid know collectively differentiate thyroid rise thyroid ptc best treat thyroid ectomy functional lymph node dissection follow radioiodine ablation therapy performance posttreatment whole body scan follow thyroid stimulate hormone tsh suppression one year radioiodine administration use sensitive thyroglobulin tg assay separate vast majority persistent free unlikely recurrent without need repeat whole body radioiodine image detectable serum tg tsh suppression tg tg rise ng ml tsh stimulation tsh tg highly likely harbor residual tsh stimulation achieve use either thyroid hormone,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Implication from thyroid function decreasing during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients: chemosensitization role of triiodothyronine Thyroid hormones have been shown to regulate breast cancer cells growth, the absence or reduction of thyroid hormones in cells could provoke a proliferation arrest in G0-G1 or weak mitochondrial activity, which makes cells insensitive to therapies for cancers through transforming into low metabolism status. This biological phenomenon may help explain why treatment efficacy and prognosis vary among breast cancer patients having hypothyroid, hyperthyroid and normal function. Nevertheless, the abnormal thyroid function in breast cancer patients has been considered being mainly caused by thyroid diseases, few studied influence of chemotherapy on thyroid function and whether its alteration during chemotherapy can influence the respose to chemotherapy is still unclear. So, we aimed to find the alterations of thyroid function and non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) prevalence druing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, and investigate the influence of thyroid hormones on chemotherapeutic efficacy. Thyroid hormones and NTIS prevalence at initial diagnosis and during chemotherapy were analyzed in 685 breast diseases patients (369 breast cancer, 316 breast benign lesions). The influence of thyroid hormones on chemotherapeutic efficacy was evaluated by chemosensitization test, to compare chemotherapeutic efficacy between breast cancer cells with chemotherapeutics plus triiodothyronine (T3) and chemotherapeutics only. In breast cancer, NTIS prevalence at the initial diagnosis was higher and increased during chemotherapy, but declined before the next chemotherapeutic course. Thyroid hormones decreased signigicantly during chemotherapy. T3 can enhance the chemosensitivity of MCF-7 to 5-Fu and taxol, with progression from G0-G1 phase to S phase. The similar chemosensitization role of T3 were found in MDA-MB-231. We compared chemotherapeutic efficacy among groups with different usage modes of T3, finding pretreatment with lower dose of T3, using higher dose of T3 together with 5-Fu or during chemotherapy with 5-Fu were all available to achieve chemosensitization, but pretreatment with lower dose of T3 until the end of chemotherapy may be a safer and more efficient therapy. Taken together, thyroid hormones decreasing during chemotherapy was found in lots of breast cancer patients. On the other hand, thyroid hormones can enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy through gatherring tumor cells in actively proliferating stage, which may provide a new adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in furture, especially for those have hypothyroidism during chemotherapy.","implication from thyroid function decreasing during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients: chemosensitization role of triiodothyronine thyroid hormones have been shown to regulate breast cancer cells growth, the absence or reduction of thyroid hormones in cells could provoke a proliferation arrest in g0-g1 or weak mitochondrial activity, which makes cells insensitive to therapies for cancers through transforming into low metabolism status. this biological phenomenon may help explain why treatment efficacy and prognosis vary among breast cancer patients having hypothyroid, hyperthyroid and normal function. nevertheless, the abnormal thyroid function in breast cancer patients has been considered being mainly caused by thyroid diseases, few studied influence of chemotherapy on thyroid function and whether its alteration during chemotherapy can influence the respose to chemotherapy is still unclear. so, we aimed to find the alterations of thyroid function and non-thyroidal illness syndrome (ntis) prevalence druing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, and investigate the influence of",implication thyroid function decrease chemotherapy breast chemosensitization role triiodothyronine thyroid hormone show regulate breast cell growth absence reduction thyroid hormone cell could provoke proliferation arrest g g weak mitochondrial activity make cell insensitive therapy transform low metabolism status biological phenomenon may help explain efficacy prognosis vary among breast hypothyroid hyperthyroid normal function nevertheless abnormal thyroid function breast consider mainly cause thyroid studied influence chemotherapy thyroid function whether alteration chemotherapy influence respose chemotherapy still unclear find alteration thyroid function non thyroidal illness syndrome ntis prevalence druing chemotherapy breast investigate influence,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in Yemen: a three-year retrospective study in a tertiary center and a specialty clinic. The prevalence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide. No previous data are available on the prevalence of thyroid cancer in Yemen. We performed this study to determine the prevalence of thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in Yemen. A retrospective chart review was performed for 550 patients with thyroid nodules who underwent fine needle aspiration and/or thyroid surgery at a private endocrine clinic and at an endocrine clinic in a tertiary hospital in Yemen over a 3 -year period from October 2016–2019. The prevalence of thyroid cancer; the sonographic findings, Bethesda classification, age, sex, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels of the patients; and the nodule size and number were reviewed. A total of 550 charts were reviewed [501 females (91.1%) and 49 males (8.9%)]. The thyroid cancer prevalence among the patients was 13.8% (CI = 10.9–16.7), and the mean age of the patients was 38.5 years (SD = 12.2). The TSH level and the rate of cancer were significantly related (P = 0.01), but no significant difference in the prevalence of thyroid cancer was found between females (13.4%) and males (18.4%) (P = 0.334). When correlating the rate of cancer with the ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (UG-FNA) result, those with Bethesda system category III and IV, V and VI had malignancy rates of 20.8, 27.2, 52.4 and 69.2%, respectively. Thyroid nodules highly suspicious for malignancy on ultrasound had a 70% cancer diagnosis rate. The most common thyroid cancer was papillary cancer (71%), followed by follicular cancer (23.7%). Among those undergoing surgery, 44.2% had thyroid cancer, and 5.2% had a premalignant diagnosis. Thyroid cancer has a higher prevalence in Yemen than in other middle eastern countries. Our study also reports a higher rate of follicular thyroid cancer than that in other published data, which has to be confirmed by further studies. The malignancy and premalignant diagnosis rate was ~ 50% in our patients who underwent surgery. Many centers in Yemen still do not perform FNA before thyroid surgery.

"Optimizing surgical outcomes in papillary thyroid carcinoma with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: a retrospective comparative study of unilateral and total thyroidectomy. The management of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) concurrent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) lacks standardized guidelines, especially concerning surgical strategies. This study aimed to compare unilateral thyroidectomy (UT) with total thyroidectomy (TT) in PTC-HT patients to optimize clinical management and improve postoperative outcomes. This retrospective study included PTC-HT patients undergoing thyroid surgery at a tertiary academic medical institution from January 2018 to August 2023. The patients were grouped according to the quartiles of preoperative thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAB) levels at the last follow-up. Additionally, patients were divided into UT and TT groups, with propensity score matching (PSM) to ensure comparability. Patients were also stratified by TPOAB levels (L: 100-400, M: 400-1000, H: >1000). Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), including quality of life and fatigue, were compared between UT and TT groups within each TPOAB subgroup (ΔPROMs = UT-TT). 246 patients were included. Those with higher TPOAB levels at the last follow-up reported increased physical fatigue scores. After PSM, there were no significant demographic differences between UT and TT groups. During a median follow-up of 16 months for UT and 20 months for TT, no recurrence or metastasis occurred. Compared to the UT group, the TT group exhibited lower TPOAB levels at the last follow-up (65.7 ± 78 vs. 374.6 ± 331.9, p < 0.001), and lower physical fatigue scores (3.6 ± 2.5 vs. 4.5 ± 2.8, p = 0.039). However, TT was associated with a higher incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism (7.8% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.030). Stratified analysis by preoperative TPOAB levels revealed significant differences in ΔPROMs (Physical fatigue) between L and H groups (0.2 ± 3.5 vs. 4.6 ± 2, p = 0.004) and between M and H groups (0.6 ± 4.5 vs. 4.6 ± 2, p = 0.037). ΔPROMs (Mental fatigue) also significantly differed between L and H groups (0 ± 1.8 vs. 1.6 ± 0.9, p = 0.026). For PTC-HT patients, particularly those with high preoperative TPOAB levels, TT offers advantages in alleviating fatigue symptoms but carries a higher risk of complications. Therefore, clinical decision-making should consider patient-specific factors, particularly preoperative TPOAB levels, to determine the optimal surgical approach.Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.

Interestingly, knockdown of HIP1R significantly reduced the number of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) in thyroid cancer cells. In addition, the interaction between HIP1R and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) was identified in thyroid cancer cells. Knockdown of HIP1R downregulated intracellular PTEN in thyroid cancer cells, but upregulated membrane-binding PTEN. Notably, flurbiprofen, a commonly used analgesic, significantly inhibited the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells and interfered with the interaction between HIP1R and PTEN, thereby enhancing the binding of PTEN to cell membrane.

"Clinical significance of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection in the treatment of clinically node-negative papillary thyroid cancer patients. Lymph nodal involvement is very common in differentiated thyroid cancer, and in addition, cervical lymph node micrometastases are observed in up to 80 % of papillary thyroid cancers. During the last decades, the role of routine central lymph node dissection (RCLD) in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has been an object of research, and it is now still controversial. Nevertheless, many scientific societies and referral authors have definitely stated that even if in expert hands, RCLD is not associated to higher morbidity; it should be indicated only in selected cases. In order to better analyze the current role of prophylactic neck dissection in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancers, an analysis of the most recent literature data was performed. Prophylactic or therapeutic lymph node dissection, selective, lateral or central lymph node dissection, modified radical neck dissection, and papillary thyroid cancer were used by the authors as keywords performing a PubMed database research. Literature reviews, PTCs large clinical series and the most recent guidelines of different referral endocrine societies, inhering neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancers, were also specifically evaluated. A higher PTC incidence was nowadays reported in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) clinical series. In addition, ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration citology allowed a more precocious diagnosis in the early phases of disease. The role of prophylactic neck dissection in papillary thyroid cancer management remains controversial especially regarding indications, approach, and surgical extension. Even if morbidity rates seem to be similar to those reported after total thyroidectomy alone, RCLD impact on local recurrence and long-term survival is still a matter of research. Nevertheless, only a selective use in high-risk cases is supported by more and more scientific data. In the last years, higher papillary thyroid cancer incidence and more precocious diagnoses were worldwide reported. Among endocrine and neck surgeons, there is agreement about indications to prophylactic treatment of node-negative “high-risk” patients. A recent trend toward RCLD avoiding radioactive treatment is still debated, but nevertheless, prophylactic dissections in low-risk cases should be avoided. Prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the benefits of different approaches and allow to drawn definitive conclusions.","clinical significance of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection in the treatment of clinically node-negative papillary thyroid cancer patients. lymph nodal involvement is very common in differentiated thyroid cancer, and in addition, cervical lymph node micrometastases are observed in up to 80 % of papillary thyroid cancers. during the last decades, the role of routine central lymph node dissection (rcld) in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) has been an object of research, and it is now still controversial. nevertheless, many scientific societies and referral authors have definitely stated that even if in expert hands, rcld is not associated to higher morbidity; it should be indicated only in selected cases. in order to better analyze the current role of prophylactic neck dissection in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancers, an analysis of the most recent literature data was performed. prophylactic or therapeutic lymph node dissection, selective, lateral or central",significance prophylactic central compartment neck dissection clinically node negative papillary thyroid lymph nodal involvement common differentiated thyroid addition cervical lymph node micrometastases observe papillary thyroid last decades role routine central lymph node dissection rcld papillary thyroid ptc object research still controversial nevertheless many scientific society referral definitely state even expert hand rcld associate high morbidity indicate select order good analyze current role prophylactic neck dissection surgical papillary thyroid recent literature data perform prophylactic therapeutic lymph node dissection selective lateral central,e,Thyroid Cancer

"A Novel Surgical Technique for Thyroid Cancer with Intra-Cricotracheal Invasion: Windmill Resection and Tetris Reconstruction The most effective treatment for thyroid cancer (TC) invading into the larynx and trachea is a complete surgical resection of the tumor, but currently employed techniques are less than ideal. We report a novel surgical technique, which we named Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction, for patients with TC invading into the laryngeal lumen. We treated eight cases of TC with invasion into the laryngeal lumen by Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction. We analyzed complications, clinical data, and pathological findings for all patients. Patients included one man and seven women (mean age 69 ± 10 years). Histopathology of TC indicated papillary cancer in five patients, poorly differentiated cancer in one patient, anaplastic cancer in one patient, and squamous cell carcinoma in one patient. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy was confirmed preoperatively by laryngoscope in four patients, and none had bilateral RLN palsy. All patients underwent Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction along with total thyroidectomy (three patients), subtotal thyroidectomy (three patients), and lobectomy (two patients). Neck dissection was performed in all patients. The average resected length of the larynx and trachea was 29 ± 6 mm. Air leakage at the suture line occurred in three patients; two required further surgery, while the third was closed by insertion of a Penrose drain. Postoperative RLN palsy occurred in five patients. Aspiration was observed in two patients and resolved within 4 weeks. Pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion occurred in some patients. No other complications, including hemorrhage, wound infection, or airway stenosis, occurred. There was no postoperative mortality and no recurrence at the anastomotic site. Two patients underwent permanent tracheostomy due to permanent bilateral RLN palsy. Two patients, one with anaplastic cancer and the other with poorly differentiated cancer, recurred 13 and 21 months after surgery, while patients with papillary thyroid cancer had no local recurrence. Importantly, laryngeal functions such as phonation and swallowing were preserved in all patients. This novel surgical technique may be as effective as window resection of the larynx for local control of TC and contributes to the quality of life of patients by resulting in a less unsightly surgical wound.","a novel surgical technique for thyroid cancer with intra-cricotracheal invasion: windmill resection and tetris reconstruction the most effective treatment for thyroid cancer (tc) invading into the larynx and trachea is a complete surgical resection of the tumor, but currently employed techniques are less than ideal. we report a novel surgical technique, which we named windmill resection and tetris reconstruction, for patients with tc invading into the laryngeal lumen. we treated eight cases of tc with invasion into the laryngeal lumen by windmill resection and tetris reconstruction. we analyzed complications, clinical data, and pathological findings for all patients. patients included one man and seven women (mean age 69 ± 10 years). histopathology of tc indicated papillary cancer in five patients, poorly differentiated cancer in one patient, anaplastic cancer in one patient, and squamous cell carcinoma in one patient. unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (rln) palsy was confirmed preoperatively by laryngoscope in four",novel surgical technique thyroid intra cricotracheal invasion windmill resection tetris reconstruction effective thyroid tc invade larynx trachea complete surgical resection currently employ technique less ideal report novel surgical technique name windmill resection tetris reconstruction tc invade laryngeal lumen treat eight tc invasion laryngeal lumen windmill resection tetris reconstruction analyze complication data pathological finding include one man seven woman mean age year histopathology tc indicated papillary five poorly differentiate one anaplastic one squamous cell carcinoma one unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve rln palsy confirm preoperatively laryngoscope four,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Thyroid cancer surgery. The surgical management of thyroid cancer is complex, controversial, and categorized by divergent opinions based upon retrospective, self-fulfilling data. This chapter will review the role of the surgeon in the evaluation of thyroid nodules and the management of malignant thyroid disease. Patients who ultimately prove to have thyroid cancer generally present with 1) a thyroid nodule with or without preoperative cytologic evidence of malignancy, 2) a rapidly enlarging neck mass with or without symptoms and signs associated with local invasion, or 3) a positive history of familial thyroid cancer with or without a positive calcitonin stimulation test, or more likely, a positive RET protooncogene screening examination for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The initial surgical evaluation is focused on evaluating risk factors. A history of head or neck irradiation in childhood or a familial history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid significantly impact surgical management. The physical examination needs to focus on evidence of local invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement, regional nodal metastases, and systemic disease. In addition, it is the surgeon’s obligation to screen for nonthyroidal disease that could impact perioperative management. This includes a history of bleeding disorders, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease, a potentially difficult airway, as well as potential endocrinopathies including thyrotoxicosis, Addisonian crisis and pheochromocytoma. It is also important to perform a laryngeal examination in every surgical candidate to evaluate recurrent laryngeal nerve integrity by the demonstration of vocal cord function. Surgery is an important, but not the only essential component in the management of patients with thyroid cancer. It is a requisite that each surgeon who manages these patients has an integrated plan that operates in concert with cytopathologists, endocrinologists, and radiation oncologists. The sensitivity and specificity of fine needle aspiration (FNA) varies between institutions and even among individual cytopathologists. Since FNA is the single most important preoperative diagnostic procedure for the majority of patients with dominant thyroid nodules, every thyroid surgeon must be able to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the FNA findings upon which critical clinical decisions are based.","thyroid cancer surgery. the surgical management of thyroid cancer is complex, controversial, and categorized by divergent opinions based upon retrospective, self-fulfilling data. this chapter will review the role of the surgeon in the evaluation of thyroid nodules and the management of malignant thyroid disease. patients who ultimately prove to have thyroid cancer generally present with 1) a thyroid nodule with or without preoperative cytologic evidence of malignancy, 2) a rapidly enlarging neck mass with or without symptoms and signs associated with local invasion, or 3) a positive history of familial thyroid cancer with or without a positive calcitonin stimulation test, or more likely, a positive ret protooncogene screening examination for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. the initial surgical evaluation is focused on evaluating risk factors. a history of head or neck irradiation in childhood or a familial history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid significantly impact surgical management. the physical",thyroid surgery surgical management thyroid complex controversial categorize divergent opinion base upon retrospective self fulfil data chapter review role surgeon evaluation thyroid nodule management malignant thyroid ultimately prove thyroid generally present thyroid nodule without preoperative cytologic evidence malignancy rapidly enlarge neck mass without symptom sign associate local invasion positive history familial thyroid without positive calcitonin stimulation test likely positive ret protooncogene screen examination medullary carcinoma thyroid initial surgical evaluation focus evaluate risk factor history head neck irradiation childhood familial history medullary carcinoma thyroid significantly impact surgical management physical,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Restricting ultrasound thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy by nodule size: which tumors are we missing? A population-based study Clinicians use nodule size to determine which thyroid nodules should receive cytological evaluation. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has recommended against cytological evaluation for nodules <1 cm. It is unknown, however, if nodule size can accurately discriminate lesions that will represent tumors with favorable versus unfavorable prognosis. Also, the characteristics of thyroid cancers that would not be diagnosed if a strict 1 cm size cut off is used as the threshold for biopsy of intrathyroidal nodules are not well established. Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a population-based cohort, we identified all thyroid nodules in Olmsted County residents from 2003-2006. To assess the presence of favorable or unfavorable features for each nodule size cutoff, each patient found to have thyroid cancer was risk-stratified using the ATA risk score, which predicts risk of recurrence and persistent disease. Thyroid cancer cases in which a biopsy was done for factors other than thyroid nodule size or suspicious ultrasound features were excluded. We identified 485 thyroid nodules, 46 (9.5%) harbored thyroid cancer. Of the 46 thyroid cancers, 37 (7.6%) had ATA low risk; 8 (1.6%) had intermediate, and only 1 (0.2%) had an ATA high risk scores. The frequency of thyroid cancer and the distribution of ATA risk scores were similar across tumor sizes. In thyroid nodules of <1 cm, 92 (87%) were benign, while 13 (13%) were malignant (11% ATA low risk, 2% ATA intermediate risk) without extrathyroid extension, aggressive histology, or distant metastasis. For all thyroid cancer patients, no cases of persistent disease were found after a median follow-up of 7 years. In this population-based study, we showed that high risk thyroid cancers are rare; indeed, in this highly selected cohort of patients, the ATA's recommendation to avoid cytologic evaluation in thyroid nodules less than 1 cm would not miss any thyroid cancer with high risk features. However, thyroid nodule size at presentation did not accurately discriminate between tumors with favorable versus unfavorable clinicopathologic features. Thus, if further discrimination is desired, for example, to avoid overdiagnosis, features other than size at presentation need to be evaluated.","restricting ultrasound thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy by nodule size: which tumors are we missing? a population-based study clinicians use nodule size to determine which thyroid nodules should receive cytological evaluation. the american thyroid association (ata) has recommended against cytological evaluation for nodules <1 cm. it is unknown, however, if nodule size can accurately discriminate lesions that will represent tumors with favorable versus unfavorable prognosis. also, the characteristics of thyroid cancers that would not be diagnosed if a strict 1 cm size cut off is used as the threshold for biopsy of intrathyroidal nodules are not well established. using the rochester epidemiology project, a population-based cohort, we identified all thyroid nodules in olmsted county residents from 2003-2006. to assess the presence of favorable or unfavorable features for each nodule size cutoff, each patient found to have thyroid cancer was risk-stratified using the ata risk score, which predicts risk of recurrence",restrict ultrasound thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy nodule size miss population base clinician use nodule size determine thyroid nodule receive cytological evaluation american thyroid association ata recommend cytological evaluation nodule cm unknown however nodule size accurately discriminate lesion represent favorable versus unfavorable prognosis also characteristic thyroid would diagnose strict cm size cut use threshold biopsy intrathyroidal nodule well establish use rochester epidemiology project population base cohort identify thyroid nodule olmsted county resident assess presence favorable unfavorable feature nodule size cutoff find thyroid risk stratify use ata risk score predict risk recurrence,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Demonstrating the undermining of science and health policy after the Fukushima nuclear accident by applying the Toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods. It is well known that science can be misused to hinder the resolution (i.e., the elimination and/or control) of a health problem. To recognize distorted and misapplied epidemiological science, a 33-item ""Toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods"" (hereinafter, the Toolkit) was published in 2021. Applying the Toolkit, we critically evaluated a review paper entitled, ""Lessons learned from Chernobyl and Fukushima on thyroid cancer screening and recommendations in the case of a future nuclear accident"" in Environment International in 2021, published by the SHAMISEN (Nuclear Emergency Situations - Improvement of Medical and Health Surveillance) international expert consortium. The article highlighted the claim that overdiagnosis of childhood thyroid cancers greatly increased the number of cases detected in ultrasound thyroid screening following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. However, the reasons cited in the SHAMISEN review paper for overdiagnosis in mass screening lacked important information about the high incidence of thyroid cancers after the accident. The SHAMISEN review paper ignored published studies of screening results in unexposed areas, and included an invalid comparison of screenings among children with screenings among adults. The review omitted the actual state of screening in Fukushima after the nuclear accident, in which only nodules > 5 mm in diameter were examined. The growth rate of thyroid cancers was not slow, as emphasized in the SHAMISEN review paper; evidence shows that cancers detected in second-round screening grew to more than 5 mm in diameter over a 2-year period. The SHAMISEN consortium used an unfounded overdiagnosis hypothesis and misguided evidence to refute that the excess incidence of thyroid cancer was attributable to the nuclear accident, despite the findings of ongoing ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer in Fukushima and around Chernobyl. By our evaluation, the SHAMISEN review paper includes 20 of the 33 items in the Toolkit that demonstrate the misuse of epidemiology. The International Agency for Research on Cancer meeting in 2017 and its publication cited in the SHAMISEN review paper includes 12 of the 33 items in the Toolkit. Finally, we recommend a few enhancements to the Toolkit to increase its utility.","demonstrating the undermining of science and health policy after the fukushima nuclear accident by applying the toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods. it is well known that science can be misused to hinder the resolution (i.e., the elimination and/or control) of a health problem. to recognize distorted and misapplied epidemiological science, a 33-item ""toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods"" (hereinafter, the toolkit) was published in 2021. applying the toolkit, we critically evaluated a review paper entitled, ""lessons learned from chernobyl and fukushima on thyroid cancer screening and recommendations in the case of a future nuclear accident"" in environment international in 2021, published by the shamisen (nuclear emergency situations - improvement of medical and health surveillance) international expert consortium. the article highlighted the claim that overdiagnosis of childhood thyroid cancers greatly increased the number of cases detected in ultrasound thyroid screening following the 2011 fukushima nuclear accident. however, the reasons cited",demonstrate undermining science health policy fukushima nuclear accident apply toolkit detect misused epidemiological method well know science misuse hinder resolution e elimination control health problem recognize distorted misapplied epidemiological science item toolkit detect misused epidemiological method hereinafter toolkit publish apply toolkit critically evaluate review paper entitle lesson learn chernobyl fukushima thyroid screening recommendation future nuclear accident environment international publish shamisen nuclear emergency situation improvement medical health surveillance international expert consortium article highlight claim overdiagnosis childhood thyroid greatly increase number detect ultrasound thyroid screening follow fukushima nuclear accident however reason cite,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Deltopectoral flap revisited for reconstruction surgery in patients with advanced thyroid cancer: a case report We present the cases of 2 patients with invasive thyroid cancer, who underwent reconstructive surgery using a deltopectoral flap. Although the overall rate of extrathyroidal extension in patients with thyroid cancer is quite low, skin invasion is the most common pattern observed. Reconstructive surgery, involving local skin flaps, is required in these patients. The deltopectoral flap relies on the blood supply from intercostal perforators of the internal thoracic artery and usually requires skin grafting to the donor site. The internal thoracic artery is rarely sacrificed in these cases, even in an advanced surgery such as in patients with invasive thyroid cancer. A 55-year-old man with a distended thyroid gland presented to our hospital. He underwent advanced surgery, including skin excision, because we suspected that his tumor was thyroid cancer. The defect was covered with an ipsilateral deltopectoral flap via transposition of the flap, without skin grafting. In the second case, a 67-year-old woman with thyroid cancer that metastasized to her neck lymph nodes presented to our institution. Although the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery was sacrificed near its origin during tumor resection, the deltopectoral flap was raised in the usual manner without any complications. The skin defect caused by the tumor resection was covered with the flap. The patient had an uneventful clinical course for more than 2 years of follow-up. These 2 cases show the effectiveness of using the deltopectoral flap as a reconstructive option for patients with thyroid cancer who underwent radical surgery, resulting in a skin defect. The first case shows that this flap does not always require skin grafting to the donor site. To our knowledge, the second case may be the first report of a deltopectoral flap that was safely raised and applied with resection of the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery. Although thyroid cancer surgery with surrounding skin excision is a rare procedure, we found that the deltopectoral flap was useful and should be the first choice for patients undergoing reconstructive surgery, whether the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery is sacrificed.","deltopectoral flap revisited for reconstruction surgery in patients with advanced thyroid cancer: a case report we present the cases of 2 patients with invasive thyroid cancer, who underwent reconstructive surgery using a deltopectoral flap. although the overall rate of extrathyroidal extension in patients with thyroid cancer is quite low, skin invasion is the most common pattern observed. reconstructive surgery, involving local skin flaps, is required in these patients. the deltopectoral flap relies on the blood supply from intercostal perforators of the internal thoracic artery and usually requires skin grafting to the donor site. the internal thoracic artery is rarely sacrificed in these cases, even in an advanced surgery such as in patients with invasive thyroid cancer. a 55-year-old man with a distended thyroid gland presented to our hospital. he underwent advanced surgery, including skin excision, because we suspected that his tumor was thyroid cancer. the defect was covered with an",deltopectoral flap revisit reconstruction surgery advanced thyroid report present invasive thyroid undergo reconstructive surgery use deltopectoral flap although overall rate extrathyroidal extension thyroid quite low skin invasion common pattern observe reconstructive surgery involve local skin flap require deltopectoral flap relies blood supply intercostal perforators internal thoracic artery usually require skin graft donor site internal thoracic artery rarely sacrifice even advanced surgery invasive thyroid year old man distended thyroid gland present hospital undergo advanced surgery include skin excision suspect thyroid defect cover,e,Thyroid Cancer
"SoLAT (Sorafenib Lenvatinib alternating treatment): a new treatment protocol with alternating Sorafenib and Lenvatinib for refractory thyroid Cancer. In the last decade, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which disrupt pathways involved in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer, have been extensively studied. Two different TKIs, lenvatinib and sorafenib, were recently approved by both the US FDA and European Medicine Agency. Until date, the duration of the TKI response is not sufficient and resistance eventually occurs. The goal of this study was to investigate a new treatment protocol, SoLAT, using sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively on refractory thyroid cancer. Patient-derived aggressive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell lines from patients with biochemical and histologically proven aggressive RAI-refractory papillary thyroid cancer were exposed to sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. Human thyroid cancer cell xenografts were obtained by injecting patient-derived aggressive PTC cell lines into the flank of female BALB/c nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. Cell viability assay, immunofluorescence analysis, confocal imaging, immunoblot analysis, flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle and a tube formation assay were performed. SoLAT was more effective for advanced PTC cell lines than individual treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that SoLAT markedly increased levels of cell cycle inhibitors (p53 and p21), and pro-apoptotic factors (Apaf-1 and cleaved caspase 3) and decreased levels of positive cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6) and anti-apoptotic factors (p-NFκB, Bcl-2). Increased sub-G0/G1 population was observed in the SoLAT group, leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and strong inhibition of advanced PTC cell viability. SoLAT reduced the level of EMT markers such as vimentin, E-cadherin, Snail and Zeb1 by FGFR inhibition. In the xenograft model, individual treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib did not markedly suppress patient-derived aggressive PTC cell xenograft tumors, whereas SoLAT significantly suppressed the proliferation of these tumors. SoLAT was more effective than individual treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib in inhibiting PTC progression by inducing cell cycle arrest. Studies using both in vitro cell culture and an in vivo xenograft model provided evidence of tumor shrinkage with SoLAT. We suggest that these effects may be due to reduced EMT-mediated drug resistance in the aggressive PTC model.","solat (sorafenib lenvatinib alternating treatment): a new treatment protocol with alternating sorafenib and lenvatinib for refractory thyroid cancer. in the last decade, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis), which disrupt pathways involved in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer, have been extensively studied. two different tkis, lenvatinib and sorafenib, were recently approved by both the us fda and european medicine agency. until date, the duration of the tki response is not sufficient and resistance eventually occurs. the goal of this study was to investigate a new treatment protocol, solat, using sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively on refractory thyroid cancer. patient-derived aggressive papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) cell lines from patients with biochemical and histologically proven aggressive rai-refractory papillary thyroid cancer were exposed to sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. human thyroid cancer cell xenografts were obtained by injecting patient-derived aggressive ptc cell lines into the flank of female balb/c nude mice. tumor-bearing mice were",solat sorafenib lenvatinib alternate new protocol alternate sorafenib lenvatinib refractory thyroid last decade several tyrosine kinase inhibitor tkis disrupt pathway involve proliferation tumorigenesis thyroid extensively studied two different tkis lenvatinib sorafenib recently approve u fda european medicine agency date duration tki response sufficient resistance eventually occur goal investigate new protocol solat use sorafenib lenvatinib alternatively refractory thyroid derive aggressive papillary thyroid ptc cell line biochemical histologically proven aggressive rai refractory papillary thyroid expose sorafenib lenvatinib alternatively human thyroid cell xenograft obtain inject derive aggressive ptc cell line flank female balb c nude mice bearing mouse,e,Thyroid Cancer

"TRAIL-induced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells: potential for therapeutic intervention. To determine whether the apoptotic machinery of thyroid cancer cells is functional and could be activated for tumoricidal purposes, we examined the apoptosis induced by the cytokines TNF-alpha, Fas and TRAIL in thyroid cancer cell lines, NPA and SW579. Interestingly, out of these cytokines, only TRAIL was able to trigger significant apoptosis. The tumoricidal effect of TRAIL was further enhanced by CHX, suggesting the presence of CHX-sensitive inhibitor(s) of apoptosis in these thyroid cancer cell lines. The anti-apoptotic proteins like FLAME-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are believed to be such CHX-sensitive inhibitors in various types of cancer cells. We, however, provide the evidence using NPA and SW579 cell lines that these proteins were not affected by the CHX treatment in thyroid cancer cells. The apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells was mediated by the classical activation of caspases that in turn activated the DNA Fragmentation Factor (DFF-45). To elucidate the role of individual caspases in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, the inhibitory effects of several general and specific tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors were studied. The inhibitors of caspase-1, -6, -8, and -9 as well as general upstream inhibitors of apoptosis could dramatically inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells. Caspase-2 and -3 inhibitors, on the other hand, had no significant effect. When the cells were treated with either agonistic Fas antibody (CH11) or TNF-alpha, no apoptotic changes were observed. The apoptosis induced by agonistic Fas Ab could be seen only after a prolonged exposure (24 h) to CHX, whereas TNF-alpha had no effect even in the presence of CHX. The efficacy of TRAIL was also tested on other types of thyroid cancer cells like ARO, FRO (anaplastic carcinoma) and TPC-1 (papillary carcinoma) and compared to that triggered by other death inducing cytokines FasL and TNF-alpha. Again TRAIL was more potent in triggering apoptosis than Fas and TNF-alpha. Since TRAIL is effective in selectively killing thyroid tumor cells without affecting normal thyrocytes and also does not cause organ toxicity and inflammation in vivo, its potential for the treatment of thyroid cancer seems very promising.","trail-induced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells: potential for therapeutic intervention. to determine whether the apoptotic machinery of thyroid cancer cells is functional and could be activated for tumoricidal purposes, we examined the apoptosis induced by the cytokines tnf-alpha, fas and trail in thyroid cancer cell lines, npa and sw579. interestingly, out of these cytokines, only trail was able to trigger significant apoptosis. the tumoricidal effect of trail was further enhanced by chx, suggesting the presence of chx-sensitive inhibitor(s) of apoptosis in these thyroid cancer cell lines. the anti-apoptotic proteins like flame-1, bcl-2 and bcl-xl are believed to be such chx-sensitive inhibitors in various types of cancer cells. we, however, provide the evidence using npa and sw579 cell lines that these proteins were not affected by the chx treatment in thyroid cancer cells. the apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells was mediated by the classical activation of caspases that in turn activated",trail induce apoptosis thyroid cell potential therapeutic intervention determine whether apoptotic machinery thyroid cell functional could activate tumoricidal examine apoptosis induce cytokine tnf alpha fa trail thyroid cell line npa sw interestingly cytokine trail able trigger significant apoptosis tumoricidal effect trail far enhance chx suggest presence chx sensitive inhibitor apoptosis thyroid cell line anti apoptotic protein like flame bcl bcl xl believe chx sensitive inhibitor various type cell however provide evidence use npa sw cell line protein affect chx thyroid cell apoptosis thyroid cell mediate classical activation caspase turn activate,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer: trends in incidence, mortality and clinical-pathological patterns in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Previous studies indicate a rapid increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in recent decades, and this increase has aroused the great public concern. The aim of this study was to analyze the trends in incidence, mortality and clinical-pathological patterns of thyroid cancer in Zhejiang province. Population-based incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were collected from eight cancer registries in Zhejiang from 2000 to 2012. The incidence and mortality rates were age-standardized to Segi’s world population. A Joinpoint model was used to examine secular trends in age-adjusted thyroid cancer rates with the Joinpoint Regression Program Version 4.0.0. Thyroid cancer patients were recruited from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from 1972 to 2014. Patient demographics, tumor histology and tumor size were compared among the different periods of 1972–1985, 1986–1999 and 2000–2014. The age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer in Zhejiang cancer registries was 2.75/105 in 2000, and increased to 19.42/105 in 2012. Additionally, we observed significantly increasing incidence rates with the Annual Percent Change (APC) of 22.86% (95%CI, 19.2%–26.7%). The age-standardized mortality of thyroid cancer in Zhejiang cancer registries was 0.23/105 in 2000 and 0.25/105 in 2012. No significant change in mortality rate was found. We observed a rapid increase in the proportions of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in 12,508 patients with thyroid carcinoma identified in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from 1972 to 2014 while the proportions of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) decreased over the decades. In the PTC cases, the proportion of patients with maximum tumor diameter (MTD) < 1 cm dramatically and significantly increased from 0 in 1972–1985 to 32.1% in 2000–2014. A rapid increase in incidence and a stable trend in mortality of thyroid cancer were found in the distribution of thyroid cancer. Most of the increased incidence was PTC, especially the papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) with MTD < 1 cm.

"Thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment: a cross- sectional study at a thyroid cancer referral center in Ecuador. In contrast to the rapid increase in thyroid cancer incidence, the mortality has remained low and stable over the last decades. In Ecuador, however, thyroid cancer mortality has increased. The objective of this study is to determine possible drivers of high rates of thyroid cancer mortality, through a cross-sectional analysis of all patients attending a thyroid cancer referral center in Ecuador. From June 2014 to December 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital de Especialidades Eugenio Espejo, a regional reference public hospital for endocrine neoplasia in adults in Quito, Ecuador. We identified the mechanism of detection, histopathology and treatment modalities from a patient interview and review of clinical records. Among 452 patients, 74.8% were young adults and 94.2% (426) were female. 13.7% had a family history of thyroid cancer, and patients’ median tumor size was 2 cm. The incidental finding was 54.2% whereas 45.8% was non-incidental. Thyroid cancer histology reported that 93.3% had papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 2.7% follicular, 1.5% Hurtle cells, 1.6% medullary, 0.7% poor differentiated, and 0.2% anaplastic carcinoma. The mean MACIS (metastasis, age, completeness, invasion, and size) score was 4.95 (CI 4.15–5.95) with 76.2% of the thyroid cancer patients having MACIS score less than or equal to 6. The very low and low risk of recurrence was 18.1% (79) and 62% (271) respectively. An analysis of 319 patients with non-metastatic thyroid cancer showed that 10.7% (34) of patients had surgical complications. Moreover, around 62.5% (80 from 128 patients with thyroglobulin laboratory results) of TC patients had a stimulated-thyroglobulin value equal or higher than 2 ng/ml. Overall, a poor surgical outcome was present in 35.1% (112) patients. Out of 436 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 86% (375) received radioactive iodine. Thyroid cancer histological characteristics and method of diagnosis are like those described in other reports without any evidence of the high frequency of aggressive thyroid cancer histology. However, we observed evidence of overtreatment and poor surgical outcomes that demand additional studies to understand their association with thyroid cancer mortality in Ecuador.","thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment: a cross- sectional study at a thyroid cancer referral center in ecuador. in contrast to the rapid increase in thyroid cancer incidence, the mortality has remained low and stable over the last decades. in ecuador, however, thyroid cancer mortality has increased. the objective of this study is to determine possible drivers of high rates of thyroid cancer mortality, through a cross-sectional analysis of all patients attending a thyroid cancer referral center in ecuador. from june 2014 to december 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the hospital de especialidades eugenio espejo, a regional reference public hospital for endocrine neoplasia in adults in quito, ecuador. we identified the mechanism of detection, histopathology and treatment modalities from a patient interview and review of clinical records. among 452 patients, 74.8% were young adults and 94.2% (426) were female. 13.7% had a family history of thyroid cancer, and patients’",thyroid overdiagnosis overtreatment cross sectional thyroid referral center ecuador contrast rapid increase thyroid incidence mortality remain low stable last decade ecuador however thyroid mortality increase determine possible driver high rate thyroid mortality cross sectional attend thyroid referral center ecuador june december cross sectional conduct hospital de especialidades eugenio espejo regional reference public hospital endocrine neoplasia adult quito ecuador identify mechanism detection histopathology modality interview review record among young adult female family history thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer epidemiology in England and Wales: time trends and geographical distribution. Thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing in many countries, whereas mortality has been falling due to better survival. Radiation is the best-established risk factor and there has been concern that recent rises in incidence might be related to fallout radiation from atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. We examined thyroid cancer time trends and geographical distribution in England and Wales and possible interpretations of these. During 1962-84, there were significant increases in incidence (P < 0.001) in each sex at ages under 45. Cohort analysis by single year of birth showed an overall increase in incidence risks in women aged 0-44 born since 1920, with a sudden rise in risk for the birth years 1952-55 followed by a lower risk for the more recent cohorts. In men, there was an overall increase in risk at ages 0-44 in successive birth cohorts, but the pattern was irregular. In each sex, the risk in persons aged 45 and over decreased slightly in successive generations. Geographically, highest incidence risks were in countries in North and Mid Wales, in which the risk was almost twice that in the rest of the country. This pattern was present only at ages 45 and over and was most clear in rural areas. The peak of thyroid cancer risk in women born in 1952-55 is consistent with a carcinogenic effect of fallout radiation, since these women were children in the late 1950s and early 1960s when fallout radiation was greatest in England and Wales. The focus of high thyroid cancer risks in Wales was in areas with high levels of fallout radiation.

"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Triiodothyronine Suppression and Withdrawal Versus Thyrogen Injections in Thyroid Cancer Assessments. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the specificity and effectiveness of triiodothyronine (T3) suppression and withdrawal, as compared to the conventional diagnostic approach using Thyrogen recombinant thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) injections, in the assessment of thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy. Methods In this retrospective study, 18 patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer at a tertiary care hospital (Mediclinic City Hospital) in Dubai were included. The patients underwent total thyroidectomy, iodine ablation, and neck ultrasound. The cohort's clinical characteristics were analyzed, and histopathological examination of thyroid nodules was performed. In this study, paired T-tests were applied to evaluate the before-and-after impact of T3 and Thyrogen treatments on TSH and thyroglobulin (TG) levels in individual patients. To further analyze the effectiveness of these treatments, independent T-tests were conducted, allowing for a comparison of TSH and TG levels between different treatment groups within the patient cohort. This approach provided a comprehensive assessment of the treatments' effects on key thyroid indicators. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of T3 withdrawal and Thyrogen post-test on TG levels was assessed using statistical measures including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Results The cohort had a mean age of 42.1 years and a female predominance. Distinct clinical profiles were observed across different thyroid cancer subtypes. Histopathological analysis confirmed typical features of papillary carcinoma variants. Significant changes in TSH levels post-treatment were noted, with T3 treatments showing a marked increase in TSH and TG levels, although changes in TG levels were not always statistically significant. Diagnostic test evaluation showed a sensitivity of 77.78%, a specificity of 83.33%, and an overall accuracy of 80.00% for T3 withdrawal and Thyrogen post-test on TG. Conclusion The study provides comprehensive insights into the clinical profiles and treatment responses in thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy. The effectiveness of T3 and Thyrogen treatments in altering TSH and TG levels was established, with significant implications for patient management. The diagnostic tests for T3 withdrawal and Thyrogen post-test on TG demonstrated high accuracy, underlining their clinical utility in the post-treatment evaluation of thyroid cancer patients.","evaluating the effectiveness of triiodothyronine suppression and withdrawal versus thyrogen injections in thyroid cancer assessments. objective this study aimed to evaluate the specificity and effectiveness of triiodothyronine (t3) suppression and withdrawal, as compared to the conventional diagnostic approach using thyrogen recombinant thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) injections, in the assessment of thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy. methods in this retrospective study, 18 patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer at a tertiary care hospital (mediclinic city hospital) in dubai were included. the patients underwent total thyroidectomy, iodine ablation, and neck ultrasound. the cohort's clinical characteristics were analyzed, and histopathological examination of thyroid nodules was performed. in this study, paired t-tests were applied to evaluate the before-and-after impact of t3 and thyrogen treatments on tsh and thyroglobulin (tg) levels in individual patients. to further analyze the effectiveness of these treatments, independent t-tests were conducted, allowing for a comparison of tsh and tg levels between different treatment",evaluate effectiveness triiodothyronine suppression withdrawal versus thyrogen injection thyroid assessment evaluate specificity effectiveness triiodothyronine suppression withdrawal compare conventional diagnostic approach use thyrogen recombinant thyroid stimulate hormone tsh injection assessment thyroid post thyroidectomy method retrospective diagnose thyroid tertiary care hospital mediclinic city hospital dubai include underwent total thyroidectomy iodine ablation neck ultrasound cohort characteristic analyze histopathological examination thyroid nodule perform pair test apply evaluate impact thyrogen tsh thyroglobulin tg level individual analyze effectiveness independent test conduct allow comparison tsh tg level different,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Fyn and Lyn gene polymorphisms impact the risk of thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine glands, and during last couple of decades, its incidence has risen alarmingly, across the globe. Etiology of thyroid cancer is still debatable. There are a few worth mentioning risk factors which contribute to initiation of abnormalities in thyroid gland leading to cancer. Genetic instability is major risk factors in thyroid carcinogenesis. Among the genetic factors, the Src family of genes (Src, Yes1, Fyn and Lyn) have been implicated in many cancers but there is little data regarding the association of these (Src, Yes1, Fyn and Lyn) genes with thyroid carcinogenesis. Fyn and Lyn genes of Src family found engaged in proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. This study was planned to examine the effect of Fyn and Lyn SNPs on thyroid cancer risk in Pakistani population in 500 patients and 500 controls. Three polymorphisms of Fyn gene (rs6916861, rs2182644 and rs12910) and three polymorphisms of Lyn gene (rs2668011, rs45587541 and rs45489500) were analyzed using Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR followed by DNA sequencing. SNP rs6916861 of Fyn gene mutant genotype (CC) showed statistically significant threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). In case of rs2182644 of Fyn gene, mutant genotype (AA) indicated statistically significant 17-fold increased risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). Statistically significant threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer was observed in genotype AC (P < 0.0001) of Fyn gene polymorphism rs12910. In SNP rs2668011 of Lyn gene, TT genotype showed statistically significant threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). In case of rs45587541 of Lyn gene, GA genotypes showed statistically significant 11-fold increased risk in thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). Haplotype analysis revealed that AAATAG*, AGACAG*, AGCCAA*, AGCCAG*, CAATAG*, CGCCAG* and CGCCGA* haplotypes of Fyn and Lyn polymorphisms are associated with increased thyroid cancer risk. These results showed that genotypes and allele distribution of Fyn and Lyn are significantly linked with increased thyroid cancer risk and could be genetic adjuster for said disease.","fyn and lyn gene polymorphisms impact the risk of thyroid cancer. thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine glands, and during last couple of decades, its incidence has risen alarmingly, across the globe. etiology of thyroid cancer is still debatable. there are a few worth mentioning risk factors which contribute to initiation of abnormalities in thyroid gland leading to cancer. genetic instability is major risk factors in thyroid carcinogenesis. among the genetic factors, the src family of genes (src, yes1, fyn and lyn) have been implicated in many cancers but there is little data regarding the association of these (src, yes1, fyn and lyn) genes with thyroid carcinogenesis. fyn and lyn genes of src family found engaged in proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. this study was planned to examine the effect of fyn and lyn snps on thyroid cancer risk in pakistani population",fyn lyn gene polymorphism impact risk thyroid thyroid common malignancy endocrine gland last couple decade incidence rise alarmingly across globe etiology thyroid still debatable worth mention risk factor contribute initiation abnormality thyroid gland lead genetic instability major risk factor thyroid carcinogenesis among genetic factor src family gene src yes fyn lyn implicate many little data regard association src yes fyn lyn gene thyroid carcinogenesis fyn lyn gene src family find engage proliferation migration invasion angiogenesis metastasis different plan examine effect fyn lyn snp thyroid risk pakistani population,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Physical activity, diabetes, and risk of thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis Thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing more rapidly over time than the occurrence of cancers of other sites, and interest in potential adverse relations of diabetes and lack of physical activity to thyroid cancer risk is accumulating. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published epidemiologic studies on the relations of physical activity and diabetes to thyroid cancer according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Published studies were identified through a search in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Random-effects models were used to summarize thyroid cancer risk estimates comparing high versus low levels of physical activity, and separately, comparing individuals with diabetes versus those without diabetes. Meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential effect modification by study design and thyroid cancer risk factors. Information was extracted from seven studies of physical activity and thyroid cancer and from six studies of diabetes and thyroid cancer. The number of individuals from studies on physical activity was 939,305 (yielding 2,250 incident thyroid cancer cases) and from studies on diabetes it was 960,840 (yielding 1,230 cases). The summary relative risk (RR) estimate from cohort and case–control studies combined indicated no association between physical activity and thyroid cancer (summary RR 1.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79–1.42). Subgroup-analyses revealed a significant positive association between physical activity and thyroid cancer in cohort studies (summary RR 1.28; 95 % CI 1.01–1.63), whereas the relation was suggestively inverse in case–control studies (summary RR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.48–1.03; p for heterogeneity = 0.005). Individuals with diabetes showed a borderline statistically significant increased risk of thyroid cancer compared with those without diabetes (summary RR 1.17; 95 % CI 0.99–1.39). The relations of physical activity and diabetes to thyroid cancer were not modified by sex, number of adjustment factors, and adjustments for adiposity, smoking, and study quality.

"Expression of the NEK family in normal and cancer tissue: an immunohistochemical study. The NEK serine/threonine protein kinases are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Alterations in these pathways are frequently associated with cell malignant cellular transformations. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour in the endocrine system. Despite good treatment methods, the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy. The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue. We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis. NEK3 expression was stronger in patients with stage II, that involved metastasis. NEK5, on the other hand, showed high expression in patients with invasion and metastasis and in patients with tumour size > 4 cm. Furthermore, this work, demonstrated for the first time a high specificity and sensitivity of over-expression of NEK1 in classical and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer and NEK3 in tall-cell papillary thyroid cancer. Taken together, the NEK protein kinases emerge as important proteins in thyroid cancer development and may help to identify malignancy and aggressiveness features during diagnosis.

"Breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland - an uncommon sentinel for diffuse metastatic disease: a case report and review of the literature. Metastases to the thyroid are rare. The most common primary cancer to metastasize to the thyroid is renal cell carcinoma, followed by malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid being rare. Overall, the outcomes in malignancies that have metastasized to the thyroid are poor. There are no prospective studies addressing the role of surgery in metastatic disease of the thyroid. Isolated thyroidectomy has been proposed as a local disease control option to palliate and prevent the potential morbidity of tumor extension related to the airway. Here, we present a case of a patient with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland and discuss the role of thyroidectomy in the context of the current literature. A 62-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman was diagnosed as having bilateral breast carcinoma in 2004, for which she underwent bilateral mastectomy. The pathology revealed multifocal disease on the right, T2N0(0/20)M0 grade 1 and 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, and on the left side, T3N1(2/18)M0 grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and regional radiotherapy. The disease was under control on hormonal therapy until 2016, when she developed cervical lymphadenopathy. The fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid was reported as papillary thyroid cancer; and the fine-needle biopsy of the left lateral nodal disease was more suggestive of breast malignancy. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and a clearance of the central compartment lymph nodes and a biopsy of the lateral nodal disease. The histopathological analysis was consistent with metastatic breast cancer in the thyroid and lymph nodes with no evidence of a primary thyroid malignancy. A past history of a malignancy elsewhere should raise the index of suspicion of metastatic disease in patients presenting with thyroid lumps with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Detection of metastases to the thyroid generally indicates poor prognosis, obviating the need of surgery in an already compromised patient. An empirical thyroidectomy should be considered in select patients for local disease control.","breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland - an uncommon sentinel for diffuse metastatic disease: a case report and review of the literature. metastases to the thyroid are rare. the most common primary cancer to metastasize to the thyroid is renal cell carcinoma, followed by malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid being rare. overall, the outcomes in malignancies that have metastasized to the thyroid are poor. there are no prospective studies addressing the role of surgery in metastatic disease of the thyroid. isolated thyroidectomy has been proposed as a local disease control option to palliate and prevent the potential morbidity of tumor extension related to the airway. here, we present a case of a patient with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland and discuss the role of thyroidectomy in the context of the current literature. a 62-year-old afro-caribbean woman was",breast metastases thyroid gland uncommon sentinel diffuse metastatic report review literature metastases thyroid rare common primary metastasize thyroid renal cell carcinoma follow malignancy gastrointestinal tract lung skin breast metastases thyroid rare overall outcome malignancy metastasize thyroid poor prospective address role surgery metastatic thyroid isolate thyroidectomy propose local control option palliate prevent potential morbidity extension relate airway present breast metastases thyroid gland discuss role thyroidectomy context current literature year old afro caribbean woman,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Epidemiological evidence for a link between postpartum thyroiditis and thyroid cancer. Key words: Case–control study, Kuwait, Postpartum thyroiditis, Thyroid cancerThyroid cancer and the large majority of benignthyroid disorders (e.g., Graves disease, nodule/adenoma, goitre, thyroiditis) occur 3–5 times morefrequently among women, and this female predomi-nance, which is greatest during reproductive ages, isobserved in all geographic areas and ethnic groups.Thyroid cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer and,in most countries, it accounts for approximately 1–6% of all cancers in females and<2% in males [1].Since the establishment of population-based cancerregistry in the late 1970s, thyroid cancer has consis-tently been the second most commonly recordedneoplasm (after breast) among Kuwaiti women.During the period 1997–2001, it accounted for 9.0%of all cancers among Kuwaiti women. Similarly highrelative frequency and incidence rates of the diseaseamong women have also been reported from severalother countries in the Gulf region (Oman, Qatar,Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). It isnoteworthy that these countries also have high birthand total fertility rates (about 5–6 children/woman).Other reproductive health patterns in these countriesinclude high prevalence of consanguinity, youngage at marriage and childbearing, short birth inter-vals, and older ages at last birth [2]. All these factorsresult in a relatively long and eventful reproductivelife.Within this setting, we conducted a population-based case–control study among 238 women withthyroid cancer and a similar number of individuallymatched controls in Kuwait [3]. Among the repro-ductive factors, we found that women who hadexperienced episodes of postpartum thyroiditis (18cases, 2 controls) were at a signiﬁcantly increased riskof developing thyroid cancer (odds ratio: 10.2; 95%CI: 2.3–44.8); and the women who had experiencedthe condition had no previous thyroid disease orX-ray exposure to the neck.

"Adolescents with thyroid nodules: retrospective analysis of factors predicting malignancy Thyroid nodules are less common in children than in adults. However, pediatric thyroid nodules have a higher rate of malignancy compared to those in adults, and increased risk of metastasis and recurrence. In the present study, we analyzed the clinical features as well as laboratory and thyroid ultrasound (US) findings of children and adolescents with thyroid nodules to identify predictive factors of thyroid cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 275 patients with thyroid nodules under 18 years of age who visited Severance Children's Hospital between January 2005 and May 2017. Among them, 141 patients who underwent ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and four patients without FNAB who underwent surgical resection, were included in this study. The remaining 125 patients without FNAB and five patients with follow-up loss after FNAB were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and US data were evaluated in 145 patients to establish the potential predictive factors of thyroid cancer. Thyroid malignancies were observed in 101 patients. Grade 2 goiters were seen more often in benign nodule group. Hypoechoic nodules, nodules with microcalcifications, abnormal lymph nodes, and irregular margins were findings significantly associated with thyroid cancer. The findings of hypoechoic nodule, nodule with microcalcifications, and abnormal lymph nodes showed statistical significance in predicting thyroid cancer.Conclusion: Hypoechoic nodules, nodules with microcalcifications, and abnormal lymph nodes are predictive factors for thyroid cancer in children. Therefore, further diagnostic evaluations, including FNAB, should be considered in patients with such findings.What is Known:• Thyroid nodules are less common in children than in adults, but pediatric thyroid nodules have a higher rate of malignancy, and also have increased risk of metastasis and recurrence.• Research on ways to predict thyroid cancer have mostly been accomplished in adult patients, and the application of risk stratification system has not been fully satisfactory in children, which requires further studies in pediatric thyroid nodules.What is New:• Hypoechoic nodules, nodules with microcalcifications, and abnormal lymph nodes are predictive factors for thyroid cancer in Korean children.","adolescents with thyroid nodules: retrospective analysis of factors predicting malignancy thyroid nodules are less common in children than in adults. however, pediatric thyroid nodules have a higher rate of malignancy compared to those in adults, and increased risk of metastasis and recurrence. in the present study, we analyzed the clinical features as well as laboratory and thyroid ultrasound (us) findings of children and adolescents with thyroid nodules to identify predictive factors of thyroid cancer. we retrospectively analyzed 275 patients with thyroid nodules under 18 years of age who visited severance children's hospital between january 2005 and may 2017. among them, 141 patients who underwent ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (fnab), and four patients without fnab who underwent surgical resection, were included in this study. the remaining 125 patients without fnab and five patients with follow-up loss after fnab were excluded. clinical, laboratory, and us data were evaluated in 145 patients",adolescent thyroid nodule retrospective factor predict malignancy thyroid nodule less common child adult however pediatric thyroid nodule high rate malignancy compare adult increase risk metastasis recurrence present analyze feature well laboratory thyroid ultrasound u finding child adolescent thyroid nodule identify predictive factor thyroid retrospectively analyze thyroid nodule year age visit severance child hospital january may among undergo ultrasonography guide fine needle aspiration biopsy fnab four without fnab undergo surgical resection include remain without fnab five follow loss fnab exclude laboratory u data evaluate,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Association between CTLA-4 + 49A > G and – 318C > T single-nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to thyroid neoplasm Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4 or CD152) is among the immune checkpoint molecules and its abnormal expression in cancer predisposed individuals might make the person more susceptible to tumor initiation and progression. Considering the implication of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTLA-4 gene expression and probably protein function, one can assume the involvement of these SNPs in neoplastic diseases. rs5742909 ( − 318C > T) and rs231775 ( + 49 A > G) are among the most commonly studied SNPs and have been considered as genetic factors related to thyroid diseases. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to elucidate the association between these SNPs and susceptibility to various types of thyroid cancers. We investigated the genetic polymorphisms of − 318C > T and + 49 A > G in the CTLA-4 gene by means of ARMS-PCR and RFLP-PCR, respectively, in 167 patients with thyroid carcinomas (papillary, follicular, and anaplastic). The results were then compared with a group of 100 age-sex matched healthy individuals. A statistically significant association was observed between the presence of G allele in + 49 A > G locus and thyroid carcinoma, when comparing cases and controls (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.35–3.28; P = 0.001) and the frequency of heterozygotes (AG) was higher than homozygotes for allele A (AA), in patients with and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Regarding Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the frequencies of A allele and AA genotype in PTC patients were higher than Hashimoto patients with no history of cancer (OR = 4.67, 95% CI = 2.70–8.08, P   T. In this study, we observed that G allele in + 49 A > G and possibly lower expression of mutated CTLA-4 molecule, is associated with higher susceptibility to thyroid carcinoma. Although the G allele frequency was higher in thyroid cancer patients, when justified for the presence of lymphocytic thyroiditis, the presence of A allele seemed to increase the odds for PTC in patients with Hashimoto’s disease.","association between ctla-4 + 49a > g and – 318c > t single-nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to thyroid neoplasm cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen 4 (ctla-4 or cd152) is among the immune checkpoint molecules and its abnormal expression in cancer predisposed individuals might make the person more susceptible to tumor initiation and progression. considering the implication of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in ctla-4 gene expression and probably protein function, one can assume the involvement of these snps in neoplastic diseases. rs5742909 ( − 318c > t) and rs231775 ( + 49 a > g) are among the most commonly studied snps and have been considered as genetic factors related to thyroid diseases. in this cross-sectional study, we aimed to elucidate the association between these snps and susceptibility to various types of thyroid cancers. we investigated the genetic polymorphisms of − 318c > t and + 49 a > g in the ctla-4 gene",association ctla g c single nucleotide polymorphism susceptibility thyroid neoplasm cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen ctla cd among immune checkpoint molecule abnormal expression predispose individual might make person susceptible initiation progression consider implication single nucleotide polymorphism snp ctla gene expression probably protein function one assume involvement snp neoplastic rs c rs g among commonly snp consider genetic factor relate thyroid cross sectional elucidate association snp susceptibility various type thyroid investigate genetic polymorphism c g ctla gene,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is a novel tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and many patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) fail to respond to conventional therapies, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Additional therapeutic targets and treatment options are needed for these patients. We recently reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is highly expressed in ATC and confers an aggressive phenotype when overexpressed in DTC cells. Methods: Microarray analysis was used to identify downstream targets of PPARγ in ATC cells. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) expression in thyroid cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens. Retroviral transduction was used to generate ATC cell lines that overexpress TXNIP, and assays that assess glucose uptake, viable cell proliferation, and invasion were used to characterize the in vitro properties of these cells. An orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse model was used to assess the effect of TXNIP overexpression in ATC cell lines in vivo. Results: Using microarray analysis, we show that TXNIP is highly upregulated when PPARγ is depleted from ATC cells. Using Western blot analysis and IHC, we show that DTC and ATC cells exhibit differential TXNIP expression patterns. DTC cell lines and patient tumors have high TXNIP expression in contrast to low or absent expression in ATC cell lines and tumors. Overexpression of TXNIP decreases the growth of HTh74 cells compared to vector controls and inhibits glucose uptake in the ATC cell lines HTh74 and T238. Importantly, TXNIP overexpression in T238 cells results in attenuated tumor growth and decreased metastasis in an orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse model. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TXNIP functions as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cells, and its downregulation is likely important in the transition from differentiated to advanced thyroid cancer. These studies underscore the potential of TXNIP as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic indicator in advanced thyroid cancer.","thioredoxin interacting protein (txnip) is a novel tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer background: thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and many patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (pdtc), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) fail to respond to conventional therapies, resulting in morbidity and mortality. additional therapeutic targets and treatment options are needed for these patients. we recently reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pparγ) is highly expressed in atc and confers an aggressive phenotype when overexpressed in dtc cells. methods: microarray analysis was used to identify downstream targets of pparγ in atc cells. western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (ihc) were used to assess thioredoxin interacting protein (txnip) expression in thyroid cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens. retroviral transduction was used to generate atc cell lines that overexpress txnip, and assays that assess glucose uptake, viable cell proliferation, and invasion were used to",thioredoxin interact protein txnip novel suppressor thyroid thyroid common endocrine malignancy many metastatic differentiate thyroid dtc poorly differentiate thyroid pdtc anaplastic thyroid atc fail respond conventional therapy result morbidity mortality additional therapeutic target option need recently report peroxisome proliferator activate receptor gamma ppar highly express atc confers aggressive phenotype overexpressed dtc cell method microarray use identify downstream target ppar atc cell western blot immunohistochemistry ihc use assess thioredoxin interact protein txnip expression thyroid cell line primary specimens retroviral transduction use generate atc cell line overexpress txnip assay assess glucose uptake viable cell proliferation invasion use,e,Thyroid Cancer
"The association between S100A13 and HMGA1 in the modulation of thyroid cancer proliferation and invasion S100A13 and high mobility group A (HMGA1) are known;  to play essential roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancer. However, the correlation between S100A13 and HMGA1 during cancer progression is not yet well understood. In this study, we determined the effects of S100A13 on HMGA1 expression in thyroid cancer cells and examined the role of HMGA1 in thyroid cancer progression. Stable ectopic S100A13 expression TT cellular proliferation was evaluated by nude mice xenografts assays. The effect of lentivirus-mediated S100A13 knockdown on thyroid cancer cellular oncogenic properties were evaluated by MTT, colony formation assays and transwell assays in TPC1 and SW579 cells. The effect of siRNA-mediated HMGA1 knockdown on thyroid cancer cellular proliferation and invasion were evaluated by MTT, colony formation assays and transwell assays. The tissue microarray was performed to investigate the correlation between S100A13 and HMGA1 expression in tumor tissues. The ectopic expression of S100A13 could increase tumor growth in a TT cell xenograft mouse model. Moreover, lentivirus-mediated S100A13 knockdown led to the inhibition of cellular oncogenic properties in thyroid cancer cells, and HMGA1 was found to be involved in the effect of S100A13 on thyroid cancer growth and invasion. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated HMGA1 knockdown was proved to inhibit the growth of TPC1 cells and invasive abilities of SW579 cells. Clinically, it was revealed that both S100A13 and HMGA1 showed a higher expression levels in thyroid cancer cases compared with those in matched normal thyroid cases (P = 0.007 and P = 0.000); S100A13 and HMGA1 expressions were identified to be positively correlated (P = 0.004, R = 0.316) when analyzed regardless of thyroid cancer types. This is the first report for the association between HMGA1 and S100A13 expression in the modulation of thyroid cancer growth and invasion.

"Search for NTRK1 proto-oncogene rearrangements in human thyroid tumours originated after therapeutic radiation Rearrangements of NTRK1 proto-oncogene were detected in 'spontaneous' papillary thyroid carcinomas with a frequency varying from 5 to 25% in different studies. These rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. To investigate if the NTRK1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of NTRK1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. These data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro culture cell lines derived from 'spontaneous' thyroid cancers. Our results concerning the radiation-associated tumours showed that only rearrangements between NTRK1 and TPM3 genes (TRK oncogene) were detected in 2/14 papillary carcinomas and in one lymph-node metastasis of one of these papillary thyroid carcinomas. All the radiation-associated adenomas were negative. In the 'spontaneous' tumours, only one of the 14 papillary carcinomas and one of the four in vitro culture cell lines, derived from a papillary carcinoma, presented a NTRK1 rearrangement also with the TPM3 gene. Twenty-five of this series of radiation-associated tumours were previously studied for the ras and RET/PTC oncogenes. In conclusion, our data: (a) show that the overall frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements is similar between radiation-associated (2/31: 6%) and 'spontaneous' epithelial thyroid tumours (2/32: 6%). The frequency, if we consider exclusively the papillary carcinomas, is in both cases 12%; (b) show that the TRK oncogene plays a role in the development of a minority of radiation-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas but not in adenomas; and (c) confirm that RET/PTC rearrangements are the major genetic alteration associated with ionizing radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.","search for ntrk1 proto-oncogene rearrangements in human thyroid tumours originated after therapeutic radiation rearrangements of ntrk1 proto-oncogene were detected in 'spontaneous' papillary thyroid carcinomas with a frequency varying from 5 to 25% in different studies. these rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of ntrk1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. to investigate if the ntrk1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of ntrk1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. these data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro",search ntrk proto oncogene rearrangement human thyroid originate therapeutic radiation rearrangement ntrk proto oncogene detect spontaneous papillary thyroid carcinoma frequency vary different rearrangement result formation chimaeric gene compose tyrosine kinase domain ntrk fuse sequence different gene investigate ntrk gene play role radiation induce thyroid carcinogenesis look presence ntrk activate rearrangement human thyroid follicular adenomas papillary carcinoma two lymph node metastasis papillary thyroid carcinoma receive external radiation use reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction southern blot direct sequence technique data compare obtain series spontaneous benign malignant thyroid collect without history radiation exposure four vitro,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Performance of claims-based algorithms for identifying incident thyroid cancer in commercial health plan enrollees receiving antidiabetic drug therapies Abstract Background Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing in the United States (US) and many other countries. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate algorithms using administrative medical claims data for identification of incident thyroid cancer. Methods This effort was part of a prospective cohort study of adults initiating therapy on antidiabetic drugs and used administrative data from a large commercial health insurer in the US. Patients had at least 6 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiation during 2009–2013, with follow-up through March, 2014 or until disenrollment. Potential incident thyroid cancers were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code 193 (malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland). Medical records were adjudicated by a thyroid cancer specialist. Several clinical variables (e.g., hospitalization, treatments) were considered as predictors of case status. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the performance of two primary algorithms. Results Charts were requested for 170 patients, 150 (88%) were received and 141 (80%) had sufficient information to adjudicate. Of the 141 potential cases identified using ≥1 ICD-9 diagnosis code 193, 72 were confirmed as incident thyroid cancer (PPV of 51% (95% CI 43–60%)). Adding the requirement for thyroid surgery increased the PPV to 68% (95% CI 58-77%); including the presence of other therapies (chemotherapy, radio-iodine therapy) had no impact. When cases were required to have thyroid surgery during follow-up and ≥2 ICD-9 193 codes within 90 days of this surgery, the PPV was 91% (95% CI 81-96%); 62 (82%) of the true cases were identified and 63 (91%) of the non-cases were removed from consideration by the algorithm as potential cases. Conclusions These findings suggest a significant degree of misclassification results from relying only on ICD-9 diagnosis codes to detect thyroid cancer.

The syndrome was first described in 1967 and, up until now, less than 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Here we report the association between this rare syndrome and thyroid cancer. When a malignant disease occurs in a patient affected by this syndrome, the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant bone lesions should be undertaken carefully. We report the case of a 57-year-old Caucasian male, admitted for diffuse bone pain localized in the left leg and for the presence of an indolent, slow-growing mass in the left shoulder. The patient also presented with a thyroid nodule, highly suggestive of a malignancy. The radiologic examination showed multiple osteolytic lesions. The suspicion of multiple myeloma or bone metastases arising from a thyroid cancer was considered. Electrophoresis of proteins was negative and therefore excluded the diagnosis of multiple myeloma; the thyroid surgery was indicated. Thyroidectomy confirmed the papillary thyroid carcinoma, and the bone lesions were considered to be metastases from the thyroid cancer. After surgery, under thyroid-stimulated hormonal conditions, the patient underwent radioiodine therapy and a post-therapy radioiodine whole body scan. The lack of radioiodine uptake, both in the bone lesions and shoulder mass, suggested the possibility of less differentiated, non-avid radioiodine lesions, or the absence of any relation between pathologies. Considering the low level of the specific tumor marker, thyroglobulin, a bone biopsy and resection of the shoulder mass were indicated. The final diagnosis was intramuscular myxoma with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia in the deltoid muscle (Mazabraud’s syndrome). A completely incidental cerebral tumor lesion was also discovered. During the evolution of a malignant disease, Mazabraud’s syndrome, known as the association of intramuscular myxoma with fibrous dysplasia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone metastasis. This is the first report in the literature of Mazabraud’s syndrome occurring in a patient with thyroid cancer.","mazabraud's syndrome and thyroid cancer, a very rare and confusing association: a case report. mazabraud’s syndrome is defined as the association between fibrous dysplasia and intramuscular myxomas. the syndrome was first described in 1967 and, up until now, less than 100 cases have been reported worldwide. here we report the association between this rare syndrome and thyroid cancer. when a malignant disease occurs in a patient affected by this syndrome, the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant bone lesions should be undertaken carefully. we report the case of a 57-year-old caucasian male, admitted for diffuse bone pain localized in the left leg and for the presence of an indolent, slow-growing mass in the left shoulder. the patient also presented with a thyroid nodule, highly suggestive of a malignancy. the radiologic examination showed multiple osteolytic lesions. the suspicion of multiple myeloma or bone metastases arising from a thyroid cancer was considered.",mazabraud syndrome thyroid rare confuse association report mazabraud syndrome define association fibrous dysplasia intramuscular myxoma syndrome first describe less report worldwide report association rare syndrome thyroid malignant occur affect syndrome differential diagnosis benign malignant bone lesion undertake carefully report year old caucasian male admit diffuse bone pain localize left leg presence indolent slow grow mass left shoulder also present thyroid nodule highly suggestive malignancy radiologic examination show multiple osteolytic lesion suspicion multiple myeloma bone metastasis arise thyroid consider,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Health-Related Quality of Life After Thyroid Cancer Surgery: A Single-Center, Cross-Sectional Study in Southern Vietnam. Background Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease in the endocrine glands. Symptoms of the disease affect the functions of organs in the body. Although thyroid cancer is often considered a ""good cancer"" because it progresses slowly, the likelihood of successful treatment is quite high; what is special is that the effect on the quality of life (QoL) is on par with more severe types of cancer. Currently, studies on QoL assessment in thyroid cancer patients are quite limited in southern Vietnam. The present study investigated the potential risk factors of deterioration in QoL scores in thyroid cancer patients after thyroidectomy. Methodology A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 162 patients who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy at the University Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from February to May 2023. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with patients and from medical records. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 was used to assess the QoL one month after thyroidectomy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to QoL with statistical significance set at p-value <0.05. Results The mean overall QoL in thyroid cancer survivors was 84.4 ± 10.00 (on a scale of 0-100, where 100 was the best). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the factors related to QoL after thyroidectomy were surgery type (p < 0.001), having a comorbidity (p = 0.029), economic status (p = 0.026), and hormone disorder (p = 0.009). Conclusions Our study indicated that surgery type, having a comorbidity, economic status, and hormone disorders were independent risk factors for decreased QoL one month after thyroidectomy. It is necessary to thoroughly assess the QoL before and after surgery in thyroid cancer patients. Longer follow-up QoL studies should be performed with larger sample sizes for more accurate results.","health-related quality of life after thyroid cancer surgery: a single-center, cross-sectional study in southern vietnam. background thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease in the endocrine glands. symptoms of the disease affect the functions of organs in the body. although thyroid cancer is often considered a ""good cancer"" because it progresses slowly, the likelihood of successful treatment is quite high; what is special is that the effect on the quality of life (qol) is on par with more severe types of cancer. currently, studies on qol assessment in thyroid cancer patients are quite limited in southern vietnam. the present study investigated the potential risk factors of deterioration in qol scores in thyroid cancer patients after thyroidectomy. methodology a descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 162 patients who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy at the university medical center ho chi minh city, vietnam, from",health related quality life thyroid surgery single center cross sectional southern vietnam thyroid common malignant endocrine glands symptom affect function organ body although thyroid often consider good progress slowly likelihood successful quite high special effect quality life qol par severe type currently qol assessment thyroid quite limit southern vietnam present investigate potential risk factor deterioration qol score thyroid thyroidectomy methodology descriptive cross sectional perform total diagnose thyroid underwent thyroidectomy university medical center ho chi minh city vietnam,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Endpoints for screening thyroid cancer in the Republic of Korea: thyroid specialists’ perspectives Cancer screening is aimed primarily at reducing deaths from the specific cancer. Thyroid-specific cancer mortality may be the most ambitious endpoint for obtaining estimates of screening effect. Numerous observations have accumulated over the years, indicating that thyroid cancer mortality endpoint has been difficult to study and is confounded by population heterogeneity, provision of randomization, and requirement of large cohorts with sufficiently long follow-up due to the excellent prognosis of the cancer. Accordingly, it may be important to reconsider how to best measure thyroid cancer screening efficacy. Recommendations against thyroid cancer screening should be based upon trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness not only in significant reduction in cancer mortality, but also of other distinct endpoints. It is desirable to evaluate derivative endpoints that can reliably predict reductions in mortality. The term ""derivative"" means a variable that is related to the true endpoint and is likely to be observable before the primary endpoint. Derivative endpoints may include thyroid cancer incidence, the proportion of early-stage tumors detected, more treatable stage, the identification of small tumors (to maintain in observation), decrease in the number of people who develop metastatic disease, the increased chance of lesser extent surgery, and the application of minimally invasive approaches, as well as no need for lifelong thyroid replacement therapy, a consistent follow-up, low-dose or no RAI administration and risk factor assessments where case findings should be continuous. The Korean guidelines for thyroid cancer national-level screening were published by a relevant group of multidisciplinary thyroid experts. It was concluded that the evidence is insufficient to balance the benefits and harms of thyroid cancer screening. However, the paper seems to raise the necessary investments in future research and demand a complete analysis for derivative endpoints, and offer screening participants with complete information necessary to make decisions that will provide them with the most value when a small thyroid cancer is screen-identified.","endpoints for screening thyroid cancer in the republic of korea: thyroid specialists’ perspectives cancer screening is aimed primarily at reducing deaths from the specific cancer. thyroid-specific cancer mortality may be the most ambitious endpoint for obtaining estimates of screening effect. numerous observations have accumulated over the years, indicating that thyroid cancer mortality endpoint has been difficult to study and is confounded by population heterogeneity, provision of randomization, and requirement of large cohorts with sufficiently long follow-up due to the excellent prognosis of the cancer. accordingly, it may be important to reconsider how to best measure thyroid cancer screening efficacy. recommendations against thyroid cancer screening should be based upon trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness not only in significant reduction in cancer mortality, but also of other distinct endpoints. it is desirable to evaluate derivative endpoints that can reliably predict reductions in mortality. the term ""derivative"" means a variable that is",endpoint screen thyroid republic korea thyroid specialist perspectives screening primarily reduce death specific thyroid specific mortality may ambitious endpoint obtain estimate screen effect numerous observation accumulate year indicate thyroid mortality endpoint difficult confound population heterogeneity provision randomization requirement large cohort sufficiently long follow due excellent prognosis accordingly may important reconsider best measure thyroid screen efficacy recommendation thyroid screening base upon trial design evaluate effectiveness significant reduction mortality also distinct endpoint desirable evaluate derivative endpoint reliably predict reduction mortality term derivative mean variable,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Increased risk of thyroid cancer among Norwegian women married to fishery workers - a retrospective cohort study The relationship between thyroid cancer in women and the occupation of their spouses was examined in a retrospective cohort study, with special reference to fishery. Of the 2.9 million women registered in the Central Population Registry of Norway on 31 December 1991, 1.2 million women had a spouse registered with an occupation in one or more of the censuses in 1960, 1970 or 1980. The women were assigned to ten broad categories based on the first digit of their husbands five-digit Nordic occupational classification code NYK, and a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for each occupational category. The women were further subdivided and analysed in 71 groups defined by the first two digits of the NYK code. Among the women included in the study, a total of 2409 cases of thyroid cancer were reported to the cancer registry of Norway during 1960-92. A significantly elevated risk of thyroid cancer was found only among women whose spouses belonged to the occupational category 'agriculture, forestry or fishery' (n = 208 279), with a SIR of 1.13. In the group associated with 'fishing, whaling and sealing work' (n = 40 839), the risk was further increased (SIR 1.91, CI 1.65-2.21). An increased risk was also detected in the group associated with 'ship officers and pilots work' (n = 29 133) (SIR 1.35, CI 1.07-1.67). When allocating the women to southern and northern cohorts determined by their county of birth, a difference in risk was clearly present in all 10 occupational categories, with figures being 50-60% higher in the north. However, there was practically no difference in incidence between northern and southern cohorts among women associated with fishery work. Thus, the results obtained from this study indicate that being a fisherman's wife is associated with elevated risk of thyroid cancer, and our data support the suggested role of seafood as an aetiological factor.","increased risk of thyroid cancer among norwegian women married to fishery workers - a retrospective cohort study the relationship between thyroid cancer in women and the occupation of their spouses was examined in a retrospective cohort study, with special reference to fishery. of the 2.9 million women registered in the central population registry of norway on 31 december 1991, 1.2 million women had a spouse registered with an occupation in one or more of the censuses in 1960, 1970 or 1980. the women were assigned to ten broad categories based on the first digit of their husbands five-digit nordic occupational classification code nyk, and a standardized incidence ratio (sir) was calculated for each occupational category. the women were further subdivided and analysed in 71 groups defined by the first two digits of the nyk code. among the women included in the study, a total of 2409 cases of thyroid cancer",increase risk thyroid among norwegian woman marry fishery worker retrospective cohort relationship thyroid woman occupation spouse examine retrospective cohort special reference fishery million woman register central population registry norway december million woman spouse register occupation one census woman assign ten broad category base first digit husband five digit nordic occupational classification code nyk standardized incidence ratio sir calculate occupational category woman far subdivide analyse group define first two digit nyk code among woman include total thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Did Introducing a New Category of Thyroid Tumors (Non-invasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-like Nuclear Features) Decrease the Risk of Malignancy for the Diagnostic Categories in the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology? In 2016, Nikiforov et al. (JAMA Oncol 2:1023-1029, 2016) proposed replacing the term ""non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma"" (FVPTC) with the term ""non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features"" (NIFTP). In 2018, to avoid the misdiagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer as NIFTP, the authors proposed changes to the criteria for NIFTP classification. Some previous studies evaluated the impact of NIFTP on the risk of malignancy (ROM) in the fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) diagnostic categories according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC). However, little is known about the influence of an NIFTP diagnosis on ROM on the basis of the revised criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of NIFTP on ROM using the revised diagnostic criteria. The present study included 998 thyroid nodules that were diagnosed and resected at the same medical center. All specimens with a diagnosis of cancer were reviewed to identify NIFTP according to the revised 2018 criteria. Additionally, molecular diagnostics were performed to detect the BRAF p.V600E mutation and TERT promoter mutations in all the NIFTP cases. The number of cases that met the revised criteria was determined, and the ROM was calculated in each of the FNAC diagnostic categories. Only five cases (2.3% of all papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnoses) were considered NIFTP, according to the 2018 criteria. With respect to the FNAC category, one case was a follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN), three cases were suspicious for malignancy (SM), and one case was malignant (M). The ROM decreased in each of the Bethesda categories (0.7% in FN/SFN, 4.3% in SM, and 0.5% in M) when a diagnosis of NIFTP was taken into account. These reductions were not statistically significant. These data indicate that the NIFTP entity has very little impact on ROM for the diagnostic categories of the Bethesda system.","did introducing a new category of thyroid tumors (non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features) decrease the risk of malignancy for the diagnostic categories in the bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology? in 2016, nikiforov et al.

"Gene expression profile of epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediators in papillary thyroid cancer. Platelet derived growth receptor alpha (PDGFRA) promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in thyroid follicular cells and is linked to lymphatic metastases in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We probed the regulatory network of genes linked to PDGFRA and EMT, comparing matched patient primary tumor and metastatic specimens, as well as engineered cell lines and ex vivo primary cultures with and without PDGFRA. Freshly isolated thyroid tumors with or without metastases, with matching neighboring benign or normal tissue, was isolated for comparative transcriptional analysis using a TaqMan Low Density array (TLDA) assay with genes representing important markers of EMT, cellular adhesion, apoptosis, differentiation, senescence, and signal transduction pathways in thyroid cancer. Transfected primary cultures and immortalized cell lines were also analyzed with respect to PDGFRA expression and cell phenotype. We reveal the consistent upregulation of serine protease DPP4 and structural protein SPP1 with the progression of PTC to metastatic disease, as well as with PDGFRA expression. Conversely, epithelial integrity gene TFF3 and transcription factor SOX10 were strongly down-regulated. This gene network also includes important mediators of EMT including DSG1, MMP3, MMP9, and BECN. We observed similar genomic changes in ex vivo normal thyroid cells transfected with PDGFRA that also exhibited a partially dedifferentiated phenotype. In particular, we observed lamellopodia with induction of PDGFRA and illustrate that DPP4 and SPP1 were upregulated in this process, with decreased TFF3 and SOX10 as seen in tissue specimens. PDGFRA did decrease nuclear protein levels of differentiation factor TTF1, but not the transcription of TTF1 and PAX8. We demonstrate that PDGFRA activates EMT pathways and decreases expression of genes favoring epithelial integrity, pushing follicular cells toward a dedifferentiated phenotype. SPP1 and DPP4, previously linked with adverse outcomes in thyroid cancer, appear to be regulated by PDGFRA. PDGFRA expression promotes metastatic disease through multiple EMT levers that favor formation of an invasive phenotype and increased metalloproteinase expression.","gene expression profile of epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediators in papillary thyroid cancer. platelet derived growth receptor alpha (pdgfra) promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) in thyroid follicular cells and is linked to lymphatic metastases in papillary thyroid cancer (ptc). we probed the regulatory network of genes linked to pdgfra and emt, comparing matched patient primary tumor and metastatic specimens, as well as engineered cell lines and ex vivo primary cultures with and without pdgfra. freshly isolated thyroid tumors with or without metastases, with matching neighboring benign or normal tissue, was isolated for comparative transcriptional analysis using a taqman low density array (tlda) assay with genes representing important markers of emt, cellular adhesion, apoptosis, differentiation, senescence, and signal transduction pathways in thyroid cancer. transfected primary cultures and immortalized cell lines were also analyzed with respect to pdgfra expression and cell phenotype. we reveal the consistent upregulation of serine protease dpp4 and structural protein",gene expression profile epithelial mesenchymal transition mediator papillary thyroid platelet derive growth receptor alpha pdgfra promote epithelial mesenchymal transition emt thyroid follicular cell link lymphatic metastasis papillary thyroid ptc probe regulatory network gene link pdgfra emt compare matched primary metastatic specimen well engineer cell line ex vivo primary culture without pdgfra freshly isolate thyroid without metastasis match neighbor benign normal tissue isolate comparative transcriptional use taqman low density array tlda assay gene represent important marker emt cellular adhesion apoptosis differentiation senescence signal transduction pathway thyroid transfected primary culture immortalize cell line also analyze respect pdgfra expression cell phenotype reveal consistent upregulation serine protease dpp structural protein,e,Thyroid Cancer

"The association of body size, reproductive factors and thyroid cancer. A population-based case-control study of the association of diet and other factors and thyroid cancer was conducted between 1980 and 1987 on Oahu, Hawaii. Study participants included 51 men and 140 women with thyroid cancer, and 113 male and 328 female controls matched on age (+/- 5 years) and sex. A significant, positive monotonic dose-response relation of weight in late adulthood (5 years prior to interview) and the risk for thyroid cancer was found for men and women. A greater than five-fold increase in the risk for thyroid cancer among men, and more than a two-fold increase in risk among women, was found for subjects in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of weight in late adulthood. Height was significantly related to the risk for thyroid cancer among men, but not women. Among men, there was a significant dose-response relation of weight in early adulthood (20-29 years of age) and the odds ratios (ORs) for thyroid cancer, although the trend was not significant after adjustment for height. Among women, there was also a positive relation of adult weight gain and thyroid cancer, with an OR of 2.6 associated with more than a 14% increase in weight. The effects of relative weight and weight gain on thyroid cancer risk were stronger in post-menopausal women than in premenopausal women. There was a significant positive interaction between fertility drug use and early adult weight and the risk for thyroid cancer in women. Odds ratios were also significantly elevated for women above the median weight in early adulthood who experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth at first pregnancy. In summary, these data show an association of weight, particularly in late adulthood, and the risk for thyroid cancer in men and women, and further suggest a positive interaction between weight in young adulthood and fertility drug use on thyroid carcinogenesis in women.","the association of body size, reproductive factors and thyroid cancer. a population-based case-control study of the association of diet and other factors and thyroid cancer was conducted between 1980 and 1987 on oahu, hawaii. study participants included 51 men and 140 women with thyroid cancer, and 113 male and 328 female controls matched on age (+/- 5 years) and sex. a significant, positive monotonic dose-response relation of weight in late adulthood (5 years prior to interview) and the risk for thyroid cancer was found for men and women. a greater than five-fold increase in the risk for thyroid cancer among men, and more than a two-fold increase in risk among women, was found for subjects in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of weight in late adulthood. height was significantly related to the risk for thyroid cancer among men, but not women. among men, there was a significant dose-response",association body size reproductive factor thyroid population base control association diet factor thyroid conduct oahu hawaii participant include men woman thyroid male female control match age year sex significant positive monotonic dose response relation weight late adulthood year prior interview risk thyroid find men woman great five fold increase risk thyroid among men two fold increase risk among woman find subject high compare low quartile weight late adulthood height significantly relate risk thyroid among men woman among men significant dose response,e,Thyroid Cancer
"The genomic and transcriptomic landscape of anaplastic thyroid cancer: implications for therapy Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the most undifferentiated form of thyroid cancer and one of the deadliest of all adult solid malignancies. Here we report the first genomic and transcriptomic profile of anaplastic thyroid cancer including those of several unique cell lines and outline novel potential drivers of malignancy and targets of therapy. We describe whole genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 1 primary anaplastic thyroid tumor and 3 authenticated cell lines. Those profiles augmented by the transcriptomes of 4 additional and unique cell lines were compared to 58 pairs of papillary thyroid carcinoma and matched normal tissue transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. The most prevalent mutations were those of TP53 and BRAF; repeated alterations of the epigenetic machinery such as frame-shift deletions of HDAC10 and EP300, loss of SMARCA2 and fusions of MECP2, BCL11A and SS18 were observed. Sequence data displayed aneuploidy and large regions of copy loss and gain in all genomes. Common regions of gain were however evident encompassing chromosomes 5p and 20q. We found novel anaplastic gene fusions including MKRN1-BRAF, FGFR2-OGDH and SS18-SLC5A11, all expressed in-frame fusions involving a known proto-oncogene. Comparison of the anaplastic thyroid cancer expression datasets with the papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissue transcriptomes suggested several known drug targets such as FGFRs, VEGFRs, KIT and RET to have lower expression levels in anaplastic specimens compared with both papillary thyroid cancers and normal tissues, confirming the observed lack of response to therapies targeting these pathways. Further integrative data analysis identified the mTOR signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in this disease. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma possessed heterogeneous and unique profiles revealing the significance of detailed molecular profiling of individual tumors and the treatment of each as a unique entity; the cell line sequence data promises to facilitate the more accurate and intentional drug screening studies for anaplastic thyroid cancer.","the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of anaplastic thyroid cancer: implications for therapy anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the most undifferentiated form of thyroid cancer and one of the deadliest of all adult solid malignancies. here we report the first genomic and transcriptomic profile of anaplastic thyroid cancer including those of several unique cell lines and outline novel potential drivers of malignancy and targets of therapy. we describe whole genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 1 primary anaplastic thyroid tumor and 3 authenticated cell lines. those profiles augmented by the transcriptomes of 4 additional and unique cell lines were compared to 58 pairs of papillary thyroid carcinoma and matched normal tissue transcriptomes from the cancer genome atlas study. the most prevalent mutations were those of tp53 and braf; repeated alterations of the epigenetic machinery such as frame-shift deletions of hdac10 and ep300, loss of smarca2 and fusions of mecp2, bcl11a and ss18 were",genomic transcriptomic landscape anaplastic thyroid implication therapy anaplastic thyroid carcinoma undifferentiated form thyroid one deadly adult solid malignancy report first genomic transcriptomic profile anaplastic thyroid include several unique cell line outline novel potential driver malignancy target therapy describe whole genomic transcriptomic profile primary anaplastic thyroid authenticate cell line profile augment transcriptomes additional unique cell line compare pair papillary thyroid carcinoma match normal tissue transcriptomes genome atlas prevalent mutation tp braf repeat alteration epigenetic machinery frame shift deletion hdac ep loss smarca fusion mecp bcl,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Risk of second primary thyroid cancer in cancer survivors. A risk factor for thyroid cancer (TC) may be a history of former cancer and cancer therapy. The precise risk of a second primary thyroid carcinoma has not yet been revealed. In this study, we evaluated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of second primary thyroid cancer (SPTC) with consideration of different conditions and further analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and survival of these patients. The cohort was selected from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program between 1975 and 2019. The standardized incidence ratios, morbidity risk, clinicopathological features, and survival of second primary thyroid carcinoma were analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance covariates. Kaplan-Meier method was performed to assess the survival outcomes. Overall, 7066 patients with SPTC and 83,113 patients with primary TC were identified. The SIR of TC in tumor patients was 1.51/10,000, statistically higher than the natural population (0.94/10,000, P < 0.05). The most significant tumors contributing to the increased SIRs of SPTC were acute lymphocytic leukemia (3.49/10,000), Hodgkin's lymphoma-nodal (3.29/10,000), salivary gland cancer (3.23/10,000), and kidney and renal pelvis cancer (3.05/10,000). The incidence of TC increased significantly in tumor patients who received radiotherapy/chemotherapy before age 35. The age at diagnosis of the SPTC was much older than the primary TC (64.01 vs. 49.55 years, p < 0.001). The SPTC had a higher percentage of histological grades 3/4 (23.14% vs. 15.19%, p < 0.001). Survival analyses demonstrated a worse prognosis for the SPTC group compared to the primary TC group. But after PSM, the survival outcomes of the two groups tended to be equivalent (P = 0.584). The SIRs of TC are higher in tumor patients. The most significant factors contributing to the increased risk of SPTC were some specific former tumors and acceptance of radiotherapy/ chemotherapy before age 35. There was no significant difference in survival between SPTC and primary TC.","risk of second primary thyroid cancer in cancer survivors. a risk factor for thyroid cancer (tc) may be a history of former cancer and cancer therapy. the precise risk of a second primary thyroid carcinoma has not yet been revealed. in this study, we evaluated standardized incidence ratios (sirs) of second primary thyroid cancer (sptc) with consideration of different conditions and further analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and survival of these patients. the cohort was selected from the us surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program between 1975 and 2019. the standardized incidence ratios, morbidity risk, clinicopathological features, and survival of second primary thyroid carcinoma were analyzed. propensity score matching (psm) was used to balance covariates. kaplan-meier method was performed to assess the survival outcomes. overall, 7066 patients with sptc and 83,113 patients with primary tc were identified. the sir of tc in tumor patients was 1.51/10,000, statistically higher than the",risk second primary thyroid survivor risk factor thyroid tc may history former therapy precise risk second primary thyroid carcinoma yet reveal evaluate standardized incidence ratio sir second primary thyroid sptc consideration different condition far analyze clinicopathological characteristic survival cohort select u surveillance epidemiology end result seer program standardized incidence ratio morbidity risk clinicopathological feature survival second primary thyroid carcinoma analyze propensity score match psm use balance covariates kaplan meier method perform assess survival outcomes overall sptc primary tc identify sir tc statistically high,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Frequency and Type of Thyroid Carcinoma in Patients With Multinodular Goiter. Background This study aimed to investigate the incidence and subtype of thyroid cancer in multinodular goitre (MNG) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Khyber Teaching Hospital, screening 207 MNG patients who received complete thyroidectomies between July and December 2022. The senior consultant diagnosed thyroid cancer based on a complete history, physical examination, and laboratory and radiological studies. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed by a senior consultant radiologist. Bethesda categories for all lesions were recorded. All patients underwent thyroidectomy, and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was confirmed on histopathology.  Results A total of 207 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 45.55 ± 8.75 years. Out of 207 patients, 24 (11.59%) were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Out of 62 male patients, 15 (7.25%) had thyroid cancer. Out of 145 female patients, only nine had cancer (p < 0.001). Nine patients with thyroid cancer had a body mass index (BMI) below 18, compared to only five patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The difference in age distribution was not significant in our study (p = 0.102).  Conclusion  In conclusion, our study sheds light on the frequency and potential risk factors associated with thyroid cancer in patients with multinodular goiter. Our findings reveal that papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most commonly observed form of thyroid cancer in this patient population, with around 12 percent of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Notably, our study highlights that male patients and those with a lower BMI may have a greater risk of developing thyroid cancer in the context of multinodular goiter. The findings of this study have important implications for the care and follow-up of MNG patients who receive total thyroidectomy.

"Potassium iodide (KI) to block the thyroid from exposure to I-131: current questions and answers to be discussed. Thyroid cancer in children and adolescents has to be considered as the most severe health consequence of a nuclear reactor emergency with release of radioiodine into the atmosphere. High doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer years later. However, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up to 1 week. Repeated iodine thyroid blocking obviously is not harmful. Side effects of iodine thyroid blocking should not be overestimated; there is little evidence for adverse effects in adults. Newborns and babies, however, may be more sensitive to side effects. In the rare case of iodine hypersensitivity, potassium perchlorate may be applied as an alternative to iodine for thyroid blocking.","potassium iodide (ki) to block the thyroid from exposure to i-131: current questions and answers to be discussed. thyroid cancer in children and adolescents has to be considered as the most severe health consequence of a nuclear reactor emergency with release of radioiodine into the atmosphere. high doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer years later. however, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. how to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the fukushima accident. lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this",potassium iodide ki block thyroid exposure current question answer discuss thyroid child adolescent consider severe health consequence nuclear reactor emergency release radioiodine atmosphere high dos potassium iodide effective block radioiodine thyroid uptake prevent development thyroid year later however controversy concern thyroid risk induce radioiodine exposure adult far interaction nutritional supply potassium iodide radioiodine uptake well interaction radioiodine certain drug address properly exist guideline recommendation proceed repeated release radioiodine open important question come recently fukushima accident lastly side effect iodine thyroid blocking alternative,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer following exposure to radioactive iodine. The thyroid gland is one of the most sensitive organs for radiation-induced oncogenesis and the magnitude of the risk from external radiation is well understood. This is not the case for internal radiation derived from the radioiodines, a matter of practical importance because of medical use and potential accidental exposure. This article reviews current knowledge derived from the follow-up of patients receiving diagnostic or therapeutic 131I and populations exposed to radioactive fallout. The latter includes the nuclear power station accident at Chernobyl and the results of atomic bomb development and testing at Hanford, the Nevada Test Site and the Marshall Islands. The most cogent information comes from Chernobyl where an epidemic of childhood thyroid cancer has followed exposure to radioiodine that was mainly 131I. Although much has been learned from this experience about the nature of radioiodine induced thyroid cancer in young children, the reconstruction of thyroid radiation doses is too preliminary to provide accurate knowledge of the risk in comparison to that from external radiation. In the Marshall Islands, much of the exposure was from short-lived radioiodines as well as external radiation, obviating the possibility to determine the risk from 131I. Exposure to 131I in the continental United States from atomic bomb testing is expected to have caused some thyroid cancers, but only in the immediate vicinity of the Nevada Test Site has any evidence of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms been adduced. This evidence is minimally significant statistically, and not significant for thyroid cancer per se. Medical use of radioiodine has not been observed to cause thyroid cancer but very few of the patients studied were young children, the group most sensitive to thyroid radiation. Despite these limitations, this information is sufficient to make some suggestions concerning protective measures in the case of nuclear accidents and the follow up of individuals who have been exposed.","thyroid cancer following exposure to radioactive iodine. the thyroid gland is one of the most sensitive organs for radiation-induced oncogenesis and the magnitude of the risk from external radiation is well understood. this is not the case for internal radiation derived from the radioiodines, a matter of practical importance because of medical use and potential accidental exposure. this article reviews current knowledge derived from the follow-up of patients receiving diagnostic or therapeutic 131i and populations exposed to radioactive fallout. the latter includes the nuclear power station accident at chernobyl and the results of atomic bomb development and testing at hanford, the nevada test site and the marshall islands. the most cogent information comes from chernobyl where an epidemic of childhood thyroid cancer has followed exposure to radioiodine that was mainly 131i. although much has been learned from this experience about the nature of radioiodine induced thyroid cancer in young children,",thyroid follow exposure radioactive iodine thyroid gland one sensitive organ radiation induce oncogenesis magnitude risk external radiation well understood internal radiation derive radioiodines matter practical importance medical use potential accidental exposure article review current knowledge derive follow receive diagnostic therapeutic population expose radioactive fallout latter include nuclear power station accident chernobyl result atomic bomb development test hanford nevada test site marshall islands cogent information come chernobyl epidemic childhood thyroid follow exposure radioiodine mainly although much learn experience nature radioiodine induce thyroid young child,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Regulators of Glucose Uptake in Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines Thyroid cancer is the most common sort of endocrine-related cancer with more prevalent in women and elderly individuals which has quickly widespread expansion in worldwide over the recent decades. Common features of malignant thyroid cells are to have accelerated metabolism and increased glucose uptake to optimize their energy supply which provides a fundamental advantage for growth. In tumor cells the retaining of required energy charge for cell survival is imperative, indeed glucose transporters are enable of promoting of this task. According to this relation it has been reported the upregulation of glucose transporters in various types of cancers. Human studies indicated that poor survival can be occurred following the high levels of GLUT1 expression in tumors. GLUT-1 and GLUT3 are the glucose transporters which seems to be mainly engaged with the oncogenesis of thyroid cancer and their expression in malignant tissues is much more than in the normal one. They are promising targets for the advancement of anticancer strategies. The lack of oncosuppressors have dominant effect on the membrane expression of GLUT1 and glucose uptake. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factors have been additionally connected with distant metastasis in thyroid cancers which mediates transcriptional regulation of glycolytic genes including GLUT1 and GLUT3. Though the physiological role of the thyroid gland is well illustrated, but the metabolic regulations in thyroid cancer remain evasive. In this study we discuss proliferation pathways of the key regulators and signaling molecules such as PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, MicroRNA, PTEN, AMPK, BRAF, c-Myc, TSH, Iodide and p53 which includes in the regulation of GLUTs in thyroid cancer cells. Incidence of deregulations in cellular energetics and metabolism are the most serious signs of cancers. In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of glucose transportation in normal and pathologic thyroid tissues is critically important and could provide significant insights in science of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease.","regulators of glucose uptake in thyroid cancer cell lines thyroid cancer is the most common sort of endocrine-related cancer with more prevalent in women and elderly individuals which has quickly widespread expansion in worldwide over the recent decades. common features of malignant thyroid cells are to have accelerated metabolism and increased glucose uptake to optimize their energy supply which provides a fundamental advantage for growth. in tumor cells the retaining of required energy charge for cell survival is imperative, indeed glucose transporters are enable of promoting of this task. according to this relation it has been reported the upregulation of glucose transporters in various types of cancers. human studies indicated that poor survival can be occurred following the high levels of glut1 expression in tumors. glut-1 and glut3 are the glucose transporters which seems to be mainly engaged with the oncogenesis of thyroid cancer and their expression in malignant tissues",regulator glucose uptake thyroid cell line thyroid common sort endocrine relate prevalent woman elderly individual quickly widespread expansion worldwide recent decade common feature malignant thyroid cell accelerate metabolism increase glucose uptake optimize energy supply provide fundamental advantage growth cell retaining required energy charge cell survival imperative indeed glucose transporter enable promote task accord relation report upregulation glucose transporter various type human indicate poor survival occur follow high level glut expression glut glut glucose transporter seem mainly engage oncogenesis thyroid expression malignant tissue,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Retrospective Evaluation of Bone Metastases in Patients With Thyroid Malignancy: A Single-Center Experience. Background Thyroid cancer is one of the five most common cancers causing bone metastasis. If there is an increase in serum thyroglobulin-antithyroglobulin levels in differentiated thyroid cancer or calcitonin levels in medullary thyroid cancer, patients should be evaluated for recurrence and distant metastasis. The skeleton is the second most common site of distant metastasis in thyroid cancer after the lung. Bone metastases cause pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression, severely reducing the quality of life. They are associated with poor prognosis. Bone metastases severely reduce the quality of life. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer with bone metastases diagnosed at our center. Methodology A total of 1,390 patients diagnosed with thyroid malignancy at our center between 2010 and 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. The study included 27 patients with differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer who had bone metastases. Results Of 27 patients, 19 (70.4%) had differentiated and eight (29.6%) had medullary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer constituted 22.2% (<i>n</i> = 6) and follicular thyroid cancer constituted 14.8% (<i>n</i> = 4) of the cases. Papillary carcinoma follicular variant, oncocytic, and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer were diagnosed with similar frequency, each accounting for 11.1% (<i>n</i> = 3). It was found that vertebrae were most commonly involved, followed by the pelvis, sternum, costae, femur and patella, shoulder and humerus, cranium, and scapula. The five-year survival rate was 72%, and the 10-year survival rate was 53%. Conclusions The number of patients with papillary cancer was the highest, but the rate of bone metastases was the lowest in this group. The highest rate of bone metastases was found in patients with poorly differentiated, oncocytic, medullary, follicular, and papillary cancer, respectively. The results obtained in this study reveal the necessity and importance of bone metastasis evaluation in patients with thyroid cancer.","retrospective evaluation of bone metastases in patients with thyroid malignancy: a single-center experience. background thyroid cancer is one of the five most common cancers causing bone metastasis. if there is an increase in serum thyroglobulin-antithyroglobulin levels in differentiated thyroid cancer or calcitonin levels in medullary thyroid cancer, patients should be evaluated for recurrence and distant metastasis. the skeleton is the second most common site of distant metastasis in thyroid cancer after the lung. bone metastases cause pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression, severely reducing the quality of life. they are associated with poor prognosis. bone metastases severely reduce the quality of life. this study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer with bone metastases diagnosed at our center. methodology a total of 1,390 patients diagnosed with thyroid malignancy at our center between 2010 and 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. the study included 27 patients with",retrospective evaluation bone metastasis thyroid malignancy single center experience thyroid one five common cause bone metastasis increase serum thyroglobulin antithyroglobulin level differentiated thyroid calcitonin level medullary thyroid evaluate recurrence distant metastasis skeleton second common site distant metastasis thyroid lung bone metastases cause pain fracture spinal cord compression severely reduce quality life associate poor prognosis bone metastases severely reduce quality life retrospectively evaluate diagnosis follow thyroid bone metastasis diagnose center methodology total diagnose thyroid malignancy center review retrospectively include,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Orthotopic mouse models for the preclinical and translational study of targeted therapies against metastatic human thyroid carcinoma with BRAF V600E or wild-type BRAF Molecular signature of advanced and metastatic thyroid carcinoma involves deregulation of multiple fundamental pathways activated in the tumor microenvironment. They include BRAFV600E and AKT that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. They can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. Humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. In addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic effects of treatments. So far, human thyroid cancer in vivo models were mainly used to test single compounds, non selective and selective. Despite the greater antitumor activity and lower toxicity obtained with different selective drugs in respect to non-selective ones, most of them are only able to delay disease progression, which ultimately could restart with similar aggressive behavior. Aggressive thyroid tumors (for example, anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) carry several complex genetic alterations that are likely cooperating to promote disease progression and might confer resistance to single-compound approaches. Orthotopic models of human thyroid cancer also hold the potential to be good models for testing novel combinatorial therapies. In this article, we will summarize results on preclinical testing of selective and nonselective single compounds in orthotopic mouse models based on validated human thyroid cancer cell lines harboring the BRAFV600E mutation or with wild-type BRAF. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential use of this model also for combinatorial approaches, which are expected to take place in the upcoming human thyroid cancer basic and clinical research.","orthotopic mouse models for the preclinical and translational study of targeted therapies against metastatic human thyroid carcinoma with braf v600e or wild-type braf molecular signature of advanced and metastatic thyroid carcinoma involves deregulation of multiple fundamental pathways activated in the tumor microenvironment. they include brafv600e and akt that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. they can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. in addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic",orthotopic mouse model preclinical translational targeted therapy metastatic human thyroid carcinoma braf v e wild type braf molecular signature advanced metastatic thyroid carcinoma involve deregulation multiple fundamental pathway activate microenvironment include brafv e akt affect initiation progression metastasis human thyroid orthotopic mouse model base human cell line generally harbor genetic alteration find human thyroid reproduce vivo situ thyroid many feature aggressive refractory human advance thyroid carcinoma include local invasion metastasis humanize orthotopic mouse model seem ideal commonly use preclinical translational compound therapy may mimic key aspect human e g metastasis also reproducibility addition might provide possibility evaluate systemic,e,Thyroid Cancer
"The platelet to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio is associated with thyroid hormone abnormalities based on NHANES 2007 to 2012 data. Thyroid hormone abnormalities are closely associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, yet easily accessible predictors remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between the platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) and thyroid hormone levels, including thyroid dysfunction. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. Weighted multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between PHR and thyroid hormone levels, as well as the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction. Subgroup analyses, smoothing curve fitting, and threshold effect analyses were also conducted to further explore potential associations. A total of 8440 participants were included, with a mean age of 47.83 ± 18.48 years and a mean platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) of 20.64 ± 8.43. Significant differences in thyroid hormone levels were observed across PHR quartiles, with higher PHR quartiles associated with elevated FT3, TT4, and hypothyroidism prevalence, and lower FT4/FT3 and FT4/TT4 ratios.In unadjusted models, PHR was positively correlated with FT3 (β = 0.007, P < 0.001), TT4 (β = 0.017, P < 0.001), and hypothyroidism (OR = 1.024, P = 0.012), and negatively correlated with FT4/FT3 and FT4/TT4 ratios. After adjusting for potential confounders, these associations remained significant. The odds of hypothyroidism were higher in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1.Nonlinear associations were observed in the threshold effect analysis, with inflection points for FT3 and TT4 at 10.050 and 24.706, respectively. Below these points, PHR showed a negative association with FT3 and a positive association with TT4, while the associations plateaued above the inflection points. PHR, a readily available biomarker, is significantly associated with FT3, TT4, and the prevalence of hypothyroidism. These findings suggest that PHR could serve as a promising marker for predicting thyroid hormone abnormalities, especially in resource-limited settings where routine thyroid screening is not feasible.","the platelet to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio is associated with thyroid hormone abnormalities based on nhanes 2007 to 2012 data. thyroid hormone abnormalities are closely associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, yet easily accessible predictors remain limited. this study aimed to investigate the association between the platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (phr) and thyroid hormone levels, including thyroid dysfunction. data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) spanning 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. weighted multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between phr and thyroid hormone levels, as well as the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction. subgroup analyses, smoothing curve fitting, and threshold effect analyses were also conducted to further explore potential associations. a total of 8440 participants were included, with a mean age of 47.83 ± 18.48 years and a mean platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (phr) of 20.64 ± 8.43. significant differences in thyroid",platelet high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio associate thyroid hormone abnormality base nhanes data thyroid hormone abnormality closely associate metabolic cardiovascular yet easily accessible predictor remain limited investigate association platelet high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio phr thyroid hormone level include thyroid dysfunction data national health nutrition examination survey nhanes span analyze weighted multiple linear logistic regression model use assess relationship phr thyroid hormone level well prevalence thyroid dysfunction subgroup analyse smooth curve fitting threshold effect also conduct far explore potential association total participant include mean age year mean platelet high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio phr significant difference thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Increased thyroid cancer risk in acromegaly Acromegaly increases cancer risk. We aimed to determine the prevalence and the predictors of tumors in acromegalic patients treated at our department. We retrospectively evaluated 160 acromegalic patients [79 female (mean age 52.0 ± 10.4 years) and 81 male (mean age 49.1 ± 12.4 years)] between 1990 and 2012, with a mean follow up period of 7.1 ± 5.7 years. The patients were screened with colonoscopy, mammography, thyroid and prostate ultrasonography. Malignancy was found in 34 (21.3 %) patients. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of malignancy among sexes (20.3 % in F vs. 22.2 % in M). Thyroid cancer was the most frequent (n = 17, 10.6 %) followed by the breast cancer (n = 4, 2.5 %) and colorectal cancer (n = 3, 1.8 %). Renal cell cancer in two patients, bladder cancer in two patients, periampullary tumor, rectal carcinoid tumor, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma and malignant mesenchymal tumor in brain in one patient were detected. One patient had both thyroid and renal cell cancer. Age of patients at diagnosis of acromegaly was significantly higher in patients with cancer (45.8 ± 9.9 vs. 40.9 ± 11.3 years, p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in duration of the disease, initial GH levels and IGF-1 % upper limit of normal values, the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia and treatment modalities between the patients with/without cancer. In logistic regression analysis, older age at diagnosis was associated with malignancy risk. The risk of cancer in acromegaly especially the thyroid cancer risk seems to be more increased than known in the literature. Therefore, acromegaly patients should be screened routinely for cancer, especially for thyroid cancer due to it being up to four times higher prevalence than breast and colorectal cancer.","increased thyroid cancer risk in acromegaly acromegaly increases cancer risk. we aimed to determine the prevalence and the predictors of tumors in acromegalic patients treated at our department. we retrospectively evaluated 160 acromegalic patients [79 female (mean age 52.0 ± 10.4 years) and 81 male (mean age 49.1 ± 12.4 years)] between 1990 and 2012, with a mean follow up period of 7.1 ± 5.7 years. the patients were screened with colonoscopy, mammography, thyroid and prostate ultrasonography. malignancy was found in 34 (21.3 %) patients. no significant difference was observed in the distribution of malignancy among sexes (20.3 % in f vs. 22.2 % in m). thyroid cancer was the most frequent (n = 17, 10.6 %) followed by the breast cancer (n = 4, 2.5 %) and colorectal cancer (n = 3, 1.8 %). renal cell cancer in two patients, bladder cancer in two patients, periampullary tumor, rectal carcinoid",increase thyroid risk acromegaly acromegaly increase risk determine prevalence predictor acromegalic treat department retrospectively evaluate acromegalic female mean age year male mean age year mean follow period year screen colonoscopy mammography thyroid prostate ultrasonography malignancy find significant difference observe distribution malignancy among sex f v thyroid frequent n follow breast n colorectal n renal cell two bladder two periampullary rectal carcinoid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"The association between breast cancer and thyroid cancer: a meta-analysis Previous studies have suggested an association between breast cancer and thyroid cancer; however, there has not been a formal meta-analysis which collates the existing evidence supporting the hypothesis that breast cancer or thyroid cancer predisposes an individual to developing the other. A systematic search was carried out using PubMed and Medline. We searched for articles containing epidemiological evidence of breast cancer following thyroid cancer and vice versa. Additionally, we searched for articles that included epidemiological data involving the incidence of all second primary malignancies (SPMs) following both breast cancer and thyroid cancer, and compared the datasets. The meta-analysis performed in a total of 18 studies showed that there is a significantly increased risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer (SIR = 1.59, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.28–1.99). Additionally, there was marginally increased risk of developing breast cancer as a second primary malignancy of thyroid cancer (SIR = 1.24, 95 % CI 1.16–1.33), compared to the general risk of developing a second primary malignancy following thyroid cancer. The findings suggest that the risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer and vice versa is increased compared to the background risk of developing other SPMs. The risk of developing thyroid cancer after a primary breast cancer was higher than the risk of developing breast cancer as a second primary malignancy of thyroid cancer. This suggests that the effects of treatment-related factors and specific pathological processes of each cancer may contribute to the increased risk rather than common risk factors including genetic factors. Elucidation of the common mechanisms between breast cancer and thyroid cancer will have important implications in both diagnostic and therapeutic management of these cancers. Benefit of thyroid ultrasound screening after breast cancer surgery needs to be assessed.","the association between breast cancer and thyroid cancer: a meta-analysis previous studies have suggested an association between breast cancer and thyroid cancer; however, there has not been a formal meta-analysis which collates the existing evidence supporting the hypothesis that breast cancer or thyroid cancer predisposes an individual to developing the other. a systematic search was carried out using pubmed and medline. we searched for articles containing epidemiological evidence of breast cancer following thyroid cancer and vice versa. additionally, we searched for articles that included epidemiological data involving the incidence of all second primary malignancies (spms) following both breast cancer and thyroid cancer, and compared the datasets. the meta-analysis performed in a total of 18 studies showed that there is a significantly increased risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer (sir = 1.59, 95 % confidence interval (ci) 1.28–1.99). additionally, there was marginally increased risk",association breast thyroid meta previous suggest association breast thyroid however formal meta collate exist evidence support hypothesis breast thyroid predispose individual develop systematic search carry use medline search article contain epidemiological evidence breast follow thyroid vice versa additionally search article include epidemiological data involve incidence second primary malignancy spms follow breast thyroid compare datasets meta perform total show significantly increase risk develop thyroid second primary malignancy breast sir confidence interval ci additionally marginally increase risk,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Nodular thyroid disease in the erderly The occurrence of thyroid nodules increases with age [1]. In geographical areas with a normal iodine intake, approximately 10% of the population develops a palpable thyroid nodule. This proportion increases in areas with insufficient iodine intake. Non-palpable thyroid nodules are usually diagnosed by a neck echography carried out for various reasons and are 5-10 folds more common than palpable nodules.; ; When evaluating a thyroid nodule, we must be aware that two conditions require particular attention: a) the possibility of a “hot” (hyperfunctioning) nodule, which can induce thyrotoxicosis; b) the possibility of a malignant nodule.; ; Both these pathological conditions increase with age [2,3]. In particular, elderly patients often show a multinodular goiter, where both hyperfunctioning nodules and hypofunctioning nodules suspicious for malignancy may coexist. When FT3 is high and/or TSH is suppressed a hyperfunctioning nodule should be suspected. In order to confirm this diagnosis the patient should carry out a thyroid scintigram. In the case that both FT3 and TSH are in the normal range, the nodule should be regarded as non-functioning. In this case a thyroid scintigram is not useful whereas a fine needle aspiration (FNAB) is the diagnostic procedure of choice [4].; ; Both hyperfunctioning and malignant thyroid nodules are more common in elderly patients. Notably, hyperthyroidism is a more serious condition in the elderly than in the young because of an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, thyroid cancer behaves more aggressively in elderly patients. In these patients thyroid cancer is usually less differentiated and lacks the ability to concentrate iodine. Therefore, thyroid cancer metastases cannot be treated with radioiodine.; ; In the case of a hyperfunctioning nodule the therapy of choice is a thyroid lobectomy. In contrast, in the case of a multinodular goiter or of a malignant nodule, a total thyrodectomy is required.","nodular thyroid disease in the erderly the occurrence of thyroid nodules increases with age [1]. in geographical areas with a normal iodine intake, approximately 10% of the population develops a palpable thyroid nodule. this proportion increases in areas with insufficient iodine intake. non-palpable thyroid nodules are usually diagnosed by a neck echography carried out for various reasons and are 5-10 folds more common than palpable nodules.; ; when evaluating a thyroid nodule, we must be aware that two conditions require particular attention: a) the possibility of a “hot” (hyperfunctioning) nodule, which can induce thyrotoxicosis; b) the possibility of a malignant nodule.; ; both these pathological conditions increase with age [2,3]. in particular, elderly patients often show a multinodular goiter, where both hyperfunctioning nodules and hypofunctioning nodules suspicious for malignancy may coexist. when ft3 is high and/or tsh is suppressed a hyperfunctioning nodule should be suspected. in order to confirm this",nodular thyroid erderly occurrence thyroid nodule increase age geographical area normal iodine intake approximately population develop palpable thyroid nodule proportion increase area insufficient iodine intake non palpable thyroid nodule usually diagnose neck echography carry various reason fold common palpable nodule evaluate thyroid nodule must aware two condition require particular attention possibility hot hyperfunctioning nodule induce thyrotoxicosis b possibility malignant nodule pathological condition increase age particular elderly often show multinodular goiter hyperfunctioning nodule hypofunctioning nodule suspicious malignancy may coexist ft high tsh suppress hyperfunctioning nodule suspect order confirm,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Familial Follicular Cell Tumors: Classification and Morphological Characteristics Familial follicular cell-derived well-differentiated thyroid cancer, papillary (PTC), and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC), accounts for 95% of thyroid malignancies. The majority of are sporadic, and at least 5% of these patients will have familial disease. Familial thyroid syndromes are classified into familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), derived from calcitonin-producing C cells, and familial follicular cell tumors or non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), derived from follicular cells. Twenty-five percent of patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) have a familial form; however, this accounts for only 1% of all patients with thyroid cancer. The familial follicular cell-derived lesions or familial non-medullary thyroid cancer can be divided into two clinical–pathological groups. The first group includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of non-thyroidal tumors, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome (Cowden disease; PHTS), Carney complex, Werner syndrome, and Pendred syndrome. The second group includes familial syndromes characterized by predominance of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), such as pure fPTC, fPTC associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma, and fPTC with multinodular goiter. Most of the progress in the genetics of familial thyroid cancer has been in patients with MTC. This is usually a component of multiple endocrine neoplasias IIA or IIB, or as pure familial medullary thyroid carcinoma syndrome. The genetic events in the familial C-cell-derived tumors are known and genotype–phenotype correlations are well established. The mutations in patients with isolated NMFTC have not been as well defined as in MTC. In many cases, patients have a known familial syndrome that has defined risk for thyroid cancer. The clinician must be knowledgeable in recognizing the possibility of an underlying familial syndrome when a patient presents with thyroid cancer. Some characteristic thyroid morphologic findings should alert the pathologist of a possible familial cancer syndrome, which may lead to further molecular genetics evaluation.","familial follicular cell tumors: classification and morphological characteristics familial follicular cell-derived well-differentiated thyroid cancer, papillary (ptc), and follicular thyroid carcinomas (ftc), accounts for 95% of thyroid malignancies. the majority of are sporadic, and at least 5% of these patients will have familial disease. familial thyroid syndromes are classified into familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (fmtc), derived from calcitonin-producing c cells, and familial follicular cell tumors or non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (fnmtc), derived from follicular cells. twenty-five percent of patients with medullary thyroid cancer (mtc) have a familial form; however, this accounts for only 1% of all patients with thyroid cancer. the familial follicular cell-derived lesions or familial non-medullary thyroid cancer can be divided into two clinical–pathological groups. the first group includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of non-thyroidal tumors, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (fap), pten-hamartoma tumor syndrome (cowden disease; phts), carney complex, werner syndrome, and pendred syndrome. the second group",familial follicular cell classification morphological characteristic familial follicular cell derive well differentiate thyroid papillary ptc follicular thyroid carcinoma ftc account thyroid malignancy majority sporadic least familial familial thyroid syndrome classify familial medullary thyroid carcinoma fmtc derive calcitonin produce c cell familial follicular cell non medullary thyroid carcinoma fnmtc derive follicular cell twenty five percent medullary thyroid mtc familial form however account thyroid familial follicular cell derive lesion familial non medullary thyroid divide two pathological group first group include familial syndrome characterize predominance non thyroidal familial adenomatous polyposis fap pten hamartoma syndrome cowden phts carney complex werner syndrome pendred syndrome second group,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Changing management in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing over the past 30 years, and it is now the seventh most common cancer in women. Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common subtype of thyroid cancer, occurring in 80% of cases. Its main pattern of spread is to cervical lymph nodes, with distant metastases occurring uncommonly. Initial treatment of papillary thyroid cancer involves resection of the primary tumor, with resection of regional lymph nodes if involved with metastatic disease. Postoperative adjuvant therapy consists of radioactive iodine ablation for most patients, followed by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression with thyroxine. An ongoing controversy in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancer is that of extent of thyroid gland and nodal resection. Consensus guidelines recommend total or near-total thyroidectomy, rather than thyroid lobectomy, as the initial procedure of choice, given its advantages of treating potential multicentric disease, facilitating maximal uptake of adjuvant radioactive iodine, and facilitating the post-treatment follow-up by monitoring serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels. In the hands of an experienced endocrine surgeon, complication rates are comparable to those for lobectomy. Major changes in the management of patients with papillary thyroid cancer over the last 10 years include the use of preoperative neck ultrasound, which can detect nonpalpable cervical lymph node metastases and potentially change the initial operation. In addition, neck ultrasound and measurement of serum Tg levels have taken the place of routine whole body radioactive iodine scans in the postoperative follow-up of patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Recurrent locoregional cervical lymph node disease should be treated by compartmental lymph node dissection, followed by another treatment dose of radioactive iodine. Chemotherapy is generally ineffective for the treatment of metastatic disease. For those patients whose tumor has become radioactive iodine resistant, emerging therapies include redifferentiation agents, antiangiogenic agents, and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","changing management in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. the incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing over the past 30 years, and it is now the seventh most common cancer in women. papillary thyroid cancer is the most common subtype of thyroid cancer, occurring in 80% of cases. its main pattern of spread is to cervical lymph nodes, with distant metastases occurring uncommonly. initial treatment of papillary thyroid cancer involves resection of the primary tumor, with resection of regional lymph nodes if involved with metastatic disease. postoperative adjuvant therapy consists of radioactive iodine ablation for most patients, followed by thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) suppression with thyroxine. an ongoing controversy in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancer is that of extent of thyroid gland and nodal resection. consensus guidelines recommend total or near-total thyroidectomy, rather than thyroid lobectomy, as the initial procedure of choice, given its advantages of treating potential multicentric",change management papillary thyroid incidence thyroid increase past year seventh common woman papillary thyroid common subtype thyroid occur main pattern spread cervical lymph node distant metastasis occur uncommonly initial papillary thyroid involve resection primary resection regional lymph node involve metastatic postoperative adjuvant therapy consist radioactive iodine ablation follow thyroid stimulate hormone tsh suppression thyroxine ongoing controversy surgical papillary thyroid extent thyroid gland nodal resection consensus guideline recommend total near total thyroidectomy rather thyroid lobectomy initial procedure choice give advantage treat potential multicentric,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid and renal tumors in patients treated with long-term lithium: case series from a lithium clinic, review of the literature and international pharmacovigilance reports Cancer had never been considered as a relevant problem in patients treated with lithium until 2015, when a document published by the European Medicine Agency concluded that long-term use of lithium might induce renal tumors. A few months later, we observed the case of a woman treated with lithium for 18 years who was diagnosed with both thyroid and renal tumors. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between lithium treatment and thyroid or renal tumors. We analyzed clinical records in our lithium clinic database, causes of death of patients who had been visited at least once at the lithium clinic, reports of lithium adverse reactions in the European and WHO pharmacovigilance databases, and published cases of thyroid and renal tumors in long-term lithium-treated patients. Of the 1871 lithium patients who had been visited at least once between 1980 and 2013, eight had been diagnosed with thyroid papillary carcinoma and two with clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma. No cases of thyroid cancer and only one case of renal tumor were the cause of death according to the 375 available death certificates. VigiAccess database contained a total of 29 and 14 cases of renal and thyroid tumors, respectively. EudraVigilance database contained 21 cases of renal and 8 of thyroid neoplasms. Literature search yielded 6 published cases of thyroid papillary carcinoma and 25 cases of various renal tumors. However, two population-based studies did not find any increased risks of cancer in patients exposed to lithium, whereas two nationwide studies did not find any excess of renal tumors. So far it has not been possible epidemiologically to confirm an increased risk of thyroid or renal cancers associated with lithium. Such a conclusion is supported by the findings of low rates and mortalities of thyroid or renal cancers from the present lithium clinic data.","thyroid and renal tumors in patients treated with long-term lithium: case series from a lithium clinic, review of the literature and international pharmacovigilance reports cancer had never been considered as a relevant problem in patients treated with lithium until 2015, when a document published by the european medicine agency concluded that long-term use of lithium might induce renal tumors. a few months later, we observed the case of a woman treated with lithium for 18 years who was diagnosed with both thyroid and renal tumors. this study aimed to investigate the correlation between lithium treatment and thyroid or renal tumors. we analyzed clinical records in our lithium clinic database, causes of death of patients who had been visited at least once at the lithium clinic, reports of lithium adverse reactions in the european and who pharmacovigilance databases, and published cases of thyroid and renal tumors in long-term lithium-treated patients. of",thyroid renal treat long term lithium series lithium clinic review literature international pharmacovigilance report never consider relevant problem treat lithium document publish european medicine agency conclude long term use lithium might induce renal month later observe woman treat lithium year diagnose thyroid renal investigate correlation lithium thyroid renal analyze record lithium clinic database cause death visit least lithium clinic report lithium adverse reaction european pharmacovigilance database publish thyroid renal long term lithium treat,e,Thyroid Cancer
"A review of species differences in the control of, and response to, chemical-induced thyroid hormone perturbations leading to thyroid cancer This review summarises the current state of knowledge regarding the physiology and control of production of thyroid hormones, the effects of chemicals in perturbing their synthesis and release that result in thyroid cancer. It does not consider the potential neurodevelopmental consequences of low thyroid hormones. There are a number of known molecular initiating events (MIEs) that affect thyroid hormone synthesis in mammals and many chemicals are able to activate multiple MIEs simultaneously. AOP analysis of chemical-induced thyroid cancer in rodents has defined the key events that predispose to the development of rodent cancer and many of these will operate in humans under appropriate conditions, if they were exposed to high enough concentrations of the affecting chemicals. There are conditions however that, at the very least, would indicate significant quantitative differences in the sensitivity of humans to these effects, with rodents being considerably more sensitive to thyroid effects by virtue of differences in the biology, transport and control of thyroid hormones in these species as opposed to humans where turnover is appreciably lower and where serum transport of T4/T3 is different to that operating in rodents. There is heated debate around claimed qualitative differences between the rodent and human thyroid physiology, and significant reservations, both scientific and regulatory, still exist in terms of the potential neurodevelopmental consequences of low thyroid hormone levels at critical windows of time. In contrast, the situation for the chemical induction of thyroid cancer, through effects on thyroid hormone production and release, is less ambiguous with both theoretical, and actual data, showing clear dose-related thresholds for the key events predisposing to chemically induced thyroid cancer in rodents. In addition, qualitative differences in transport, and quantitative differences in half life, catabolism and turnover of thyroid hormones, exist that would not operate under normal situations in humans.","a review of species differences in the control of, and response to, chemical-induced thyroid hormone perturbations leading to thyroid cancer this review summarises the current state of knowledge regarding the physiology and control of production of thyroid hormones, the effects of chemicals in perturbing their synthesis and release that result in thyroid cancer. it does not consider the potential neurodevelopmental consequences of low thyroid hormones. there are a number of known molecular initiating events (mies) that affect thyroid hormone synthesis in mammals and many chemicals are able to activate multiple mies simultaneously. aop analysis of chemical-induced thyroid cancer in rodents has defined the key events that predispose to the development of rodent cancer and many of these will operate in humans under appropriate conditions, if they were exposed to high enough concentrations of the affecting chemicals. there are conditions however that, at the very least, would indicate significant quantitative differences",review specie difference control response chemical induce thyroid hormone perturbation lead thyroid review summarise current state knowledge regard physiology control production thyroid hormone effect chemical perturb synthesis release result thyroid consider potential neurodevelopmental consequence low thyroid hormone number known molecular initiate event mies affect thyroid hormone synthesis mammal many chemical able activate multiple mies simultaneously aop chemical induce thyroid rodent define key event predispose development rodent many operate human appropriate condition expose high enough concentration affecting chemical condition however least would indicate significant quantitative difference,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer risks among medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996–2015 Thyroid cancer rates, especially among children, are known to be increased by radiation exposure. However, little is known about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on thyroid cancer risk in adulthood. This study examined radiation effects on thyroid cancer rates as well as an overall evaluation of thyroid cancer risk among medical radiation workers. Data on all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the national dosimetry registry between 1996 and 2011 were linked with the cancer registry data through 2015. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare the observed cancer incidence rates in this population to those for the general population while internal comparisons were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) for occupational history and excess relative risks (ERRs) were used to quantify the radiation dose-response relationship. Overall, 827 thyroid cancer cases were reported among 93,922 medical radiation workers. Thyroid cancer SIRs were significantly higher than expected for both men (SIR 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.91) and women (SIR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.28). However, RRs for thyroid cancer by job title and duration of employment showed no particular pattern among diagnostic medical radiation workers. There were no indications of a significant dose effect on thyroid cancer rates for either men (ERR/100 mGy 0.07, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.53) or women (ERR/100 mGy -0.13, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.23). The findings were similar for different job titles or when limited to workers employed for at least one year. While thyroid cancer incidence rates among Korean medical radiation workers were somewhat higher than those in the general population, there was no significant evidence that this increase was associated with occupational radiation dose. Additional follow-up together with consideration of other risk factors should provide useful information on thyroid cancer rates in this cohort.","thyroid cancer risks among medical radiation workers in south korea, 1996–2015 thyroid cancer rates, especially among children, are known to be increased by radiation exposure. however, little is known about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on thyroid cancer risk in adulthood. this study examined radiation effects on thyroid cancer rates as well as an overall evaluation of thyroid cancer risk among medical radiation workers. data on all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the national dosimetry registry between 1996 and 2011 were linked with the cancer registry data through 2015. standardized incidence ratios (sirs) were used to compare the observed cancer incidence rates in this population to those for the general population while internal comparisons were used to estimate relative risks (rrs) for occupational history and excess relative risks (errs) were used to quantify the radiation dose-response relationship. overall, 827 thyroid cancer cases were reported among 93,922 medical",thyroid risk among medical radiation worker south korea thyroid rate especially among child know increase radiation exposure however little know impact chronic low dose radiation exposure thyroid risk adulthood examine radiation effect thyroid rate well overall evaluation thyroid risk among medical radiation worker data diagnostic medical radiation worker enrol national dosimetry registry link registry data standardized incidence ratio sir use compare observed incidence rate population general population internal comparison use estimate relative risk rrs occupational history excess relative risk errs use quantify radiation dose response relationship overall thyroid report among medical,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Activation of tumor cell proliferation by thyroid hormone in a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma Thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system in humans. To understand the molecular genetic events underlying thyroid carcinogenesis, we have generated a mouse model that spontaneously develops follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human thyroid cancer (Thrb(PV/PV) mouse). This mutant mouse harbors a dominant-negative mutated thyroid hormone receptor β (denoted PV). The PV mutation was identified in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (TH). Thrb(PV/PV) mice exhibit highly elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and increased TH. We have previously shown that thyroid-stimulating hormone is required, but not sufficient to induce metastatic follicular thyroid cancer in Thrb(PV/PV) mice. However, whether the elevated TH also contributes to the thyroid carcinogenesis of Thrb(PV/PV) mice was not elucidated. To understand the role of TH in thyroid carcinogenesis, we blocked the production of TH by treating Thrb(PV/PV) mice with propylthiouracil (Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice) and compared the development of thyroid cancer in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU and untreated Thrb(PV/PV) mice. We found that thyroid tumor growth was reduced by ∼42% in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice as compared with Thrb(PV/PV) mice. Analysis by bromodeoxyuridine-nuclear labeling showed decreased incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in thyroid tumor cells of Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice, indicative of decreased tumor cell proliferation. However, cleaved-caspase 3 staining showed no apparent changes in apoptosis of tumor cells in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice. Molecular studies identified a marked attenuation of the PI3K-AKT-β-catenin signaling pathway that led to decreased protein levels of cyclin D2, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase-2, a downstream target of β-catenin and a key regulator during tumor invasion and metastasis, was also decreased. Thus, the present study uncovers a critical role of TH in promoting the thyroid carcinogenesis of Thrb(PV/PV) mice via membrane signaling events. Importantly, these findings suggest that anti-thyroid drugs could be considered as possible therapeutic agents of thyroid cancer.","activation of tumor cell proliferation by thyroid hormone in a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system in humans. to understand the molecular genetic events underlying thyroid carcinogenesis, we have generated a mouse model that spontaneously develops follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human thyroid cancer (thrb(pv/pv) mouse). this mutant mouse harbors a dominant-negative mutated thyroid hormone receptor β (denoted pv). the pv mutation was identified in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (th). thrb(pv/pv) mice exhibit highly elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and increased th. we have previously shown that thyroid-stimulating hormone is required, but not sufficient to induce metastatic follicular thyroid cancer in thrb(pv/pv) mice. however, whether the elevated th also contributes to the thyroid carcinogenesis of thrb(pv/pv) mice was not elucidated. to understand the role of th in thyroid carcinogenesis, we blocked the production of th by",activation cell proliferation thyroid hormone mouse model follicular thyroid carcinoma thyroid common malignancy endocrine system human understand molecular genetic event underlie thyroid carcinogenesis generate mouse model spontaneously develop follicular thyroid carcinoma similar human thyroid thrb pv pv mouse mutant mouse harbor dominant negative mutate thyroid hormone receptor denote pv pv mutation identify resistance thyroid hormone th thrb pv pv mouse exhibit highly elevate serum thyroid stimulate hormone level increase th previously show thyroid stimulate hormone require sufficient induce metastatic follicular thyroid thrb pv pv mouse however whether elevated th also contribute thyroid carcinogenesis thrb pv pv mouse elucidate understand role th thyroid carcinogenesis block production th,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Molecular target based combinational therapeutic approaches in thyroid cancer Thyroid cancer, as with other types of cancer, is dependent on angiogenesis for its continued growth and development. Interestingly, estrogen has been shown to contribute to thyroid cancer aggressiveness in vitro, which is in full support of the observed increased incidence of thyroid cancer in women over men. Provided that estrogen has been observed to contribute to increased angiogenesis of estrogen responsive breast cancer, it is conceivable to speculate that estrogen also contributes to angiogenesis of estrogen responsive thyroid cancer. In this study, three human thyroid cancer cells (B-CPAP, CGTH-W-1, ML-1) were treated with estrogen alone or estrogen and anti-estrogens (fulvestrant and 3,3′-diindolylmethane, a natural dietary compound) for 24 hours. The cell culture media was then added to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) and assayed for angiogenesis associated events. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were also quantified in the conditioned media so as to evaluate if it is a key player involved in these observations. Conditioned medium from estrogen treated thyroid cancer cells enhanced phenotypical changes (proliferation, migration and tubulogenesis) of endothelial cells typically observed during angiogenesis. These phenotypic changes observed in HUVECs were determined to be modulated by estrogen induced secretion of VEGF by the cancer cells. Lastly, we show that VEGF secretion was inhibited by the anti-estrogens, fulvestrant and 3,3′-diindolylmethane, which resulted in diminished angiogenesis associated events in HUVECs. Our data establishes estrogen as being a key regulator of VEGF secretion/expression in thyroid cells which enhances the process of angiogenesis in thyroid cancer. These findings also suggest the clinical utility of anti-estrogens as anti-angiogenic compounds to be used as a therapeutic means to treat thyroid cancer. We also observed that 3,3′-diindolylmethane is a promising naturally occurring anti-estrogen which can be used as a part of therapeutic regimen to treat thyroid cancer.","molecular target based combinational therapeutic approaches in thyroid cancer thyroid cancer, as with other types of cancer, is dependent on angiogenesis for its continued growth and development. interestingly, estrogen has been shown to contribute to thyroid cancer aggressiveness in vitro, which is in full support of the observed increased incidence of thyroid cancer in women over men. provided that estrogen has been observed to contribute to increased angiogenesis of estrogen responsive breast cancer, it is conceivable to speculate that estrogen also contributes to angiogenesis of estrogen responsive thyroid cancer. in this study, three human thyroid cancer cells (b-cpap, cgth-w-1, ml-1) were treated with estrogen alone or estrogen and anti-estrogens (fulvestrant and 3,3′-diindolylmethane, a natural dietary compound) for 24 hours. the cell culture media was then added to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (huvecs) and assayed for angiogenesis associated events. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) levels were also quantified in the",molecular target base combinational therapeutic approach thyroid thyroid type dependent angiogenesis continued growth development interestingly estrogen show contribute thyroid aggressiveness vitro full support observed increase incidence thyroid woman men provide estrogen observe contribute increased angiogenesis estrogen responsive breast conceivable speculate estrogen also contribute angiogenesis estrogen responsive thyroid three human thyroid cell b cpap cgth w ml treat estrogen alone estrogen anti estrogen fulvestrant diindolylmethane natural dietary compound hour cell culture medium add human umbilical vein endothelial cell huvecs assay angiogenesis associate event vascular endothelial growth factor vegf level also quantify,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Incidence and histological patterns of thyroid cancer in Sri Lanka 2001-2010: an analysis of national cancer registry data. An increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is observed in many developed countries. Increasing incidence may also reflect better reporting or increased diagnostic scrutiny. We conducted this study to examine trends in thyroid cancer incidence and histological patterns in Sri Lanka. A retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer during 2001–2010 was performed using population based data published from the Sri Lanka National Cancer Registry. Trends in incidence and histological patterns were analysed by age and gender. The age-standardized incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 2.44 per 100,000 in 2001 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.21–2.67) to 5.16 per 100,000 in 2010 (95% CI: 4.85–5.47); a 2.1-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). A greater part of this increase is attributable to increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancer, which increased from 1.64 to 3.61 per 100,000; a 2.2-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). Follicular cancer showed lesser, yet a significant increase from 0.56 to 0.95 per 100,000 (p < 0.05). Other varieties of thyroid cancer showed no significant increases in incidence. Trends in the increases in incidence of papillary cancer in females showed a much greater increase compared with males (from 2.45 to 5.60 per 100,000, a 2.28-fold increase in females compared with from 0.82 to 1.55; a 1.89-fold increase in males, p < 0.001). Highest incidence of papillary cancer was observed in 30–39-year age group, which has increased from 5.56 to 12.9 per 100,000; a 2.32-fold increase (p < 0.001). The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in Sri Lanka is predominantly due to the increasing incidence of papillary cancers. These trends may reflect increased detection and better reporting, although an inherent increase in the incidence is the likely main contributor. Further studies including tumour stage and mortality may help answer these questions.","incidence and histological patterns of thyroid cancer in sri lanka 2001-2010: an analysis of national cancer registry data. an increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is observed in many developed countries. increasing incidence may also reflect better reporting or increased diagnostic scrutiny. we conducted this study to examine trends in thyroid cancer incidence and histological patterns in sri lanka. a retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer during 2001–2010 was performed using population based data published from the sri lanka national cancer registry. trends in incidence and histological patterns were analysed by age and gender. the age-standardized incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 2.44 per 100,000 in 2001 (95% confidence interval [95% ci]: 2.21–2.67) to 5.16 per 100,000 in 2010 (95% ci: 4.85–5.47); a 2.1-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). a greater part of this increase is attributable to increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancer, which increased from",incidence histological pattern thyroid sri lanka national registry data increase incidence thyroid observe many developed country increase incidence may also reflect good reporting increase diagnostic scrutiny conduct examine trend thyroid incidence histological pattern sri lanka retrospective cohort evaluation thyroid perform use population base data publish sri lanka national registry trend incidence histological pattern analyse age gender age standardize incidence thyroid increase per confidence interval ci per ci fold increase p trend great part increase attributable increase incidence papillary thyroid increase,e,Thyroid Cancer

The burden and trend of thyroid cancer in Vietnam have not been well documented. This study aimed to investigate the trends in incidence and histological pattern of thyroid cancer in Ho Chi Minh City from 1996 to 2015. A population-based study retrieved data from the Ho Chi Minh City Cancer Registry during 1996–2015. Trends in the incidence of thyroid cancer were investigated based on age, gender, and histology for each 5-year period. Annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates was estimated using Joinpoint regression analysis. In the study period, there were 5953 thyroid cancer cases (men-to-women ratio 1:4.5) newly diagnosed in Ho Chi Minh City with the mean age of 42.9 years (±14.9 years). The age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer increased from 2.4 per 100,000 during 1996–2000 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.2–2.6) to 7.5 per 100,000 during 2011–2015 (95% CI: 7.3–7.9), corresponded to an overall APC of 8.7 (95% CI 7.6–9.9). The APC in men and women was 6.2 (95% CI: 4.2–8.2) and 9.2 (95% CI: 8.0–10.4), respectively. The incidence rate in the < 45 years age group was the highest diagnosed overall and increased significantly in both men (APC 11.0) and women (APC 10.1). Both genders shared similar distribution of subtype incidences, with papillary thyroid cancer constituted the most diagnosed (73.3% in men and 85.2% in women). The papillary thyroid cancer observed a markedly increase overall (APC of 10.7 (95% CI 9.3–12.0)). There were appreciable increases in the age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer in both genders, mainly contributed by the papillary subtype.

"Higher thyroid hormone levels and cancer. This narrative review aims to summarize the relationship between hyperthyroidism, upper reference range thyroid hormone (TH) levels, and cancer, and to address the clinical management of hyperthyroidism in cancer patients. A comprehensive search was performed by an independent reviewer through Google Scholar and PubMed Electronic databases. All searches were restricted to English language manuscripts published between 2000 and 2020. Numerous in vitro, in vivo, and population-based studies suggest cancer-stimulating effect of triiodothyronine and thyroxin. THs are presented as mediators for tumor growth, proliferation, and progression. Many population and case–control studies suggest an increased risk of several solid but also hematologic malignancies in relation to hyperthyroidism and upper normal range TH levels. However, results are not unambiguous. In this review, we will summarize population and case–control studies that investigated the relationship between hyperthyroidism, upper reference range TH levels, lower thyrotropin (TSH) levels, lower reference range TSH levels with cancer risk, cancer prognosis, and cancer outcome. The vast majority of evidence suggests an association between clinical and subclinical hyperthyroidism with the risk of developing several types of cancer. Furthermore, hyperthyroidism is also linked with a poorer cancer prognosis. In this review, we will also discuss the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in patients with pre-existing cancer and cover the management of hyperthyroidism in cancer patients, with special attention on the role of nuclear medicine. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of the rapid establishment of euthyroidism, and consequently, the importance of radioiodine therapy, as the therapy of choice in most cancer patients. We want to show that in this day and age there still is a high relevance for I-131 to achieve a permanent solution and thus likely reduce the risk of adverse influence of hyperthyroidism on the occurrence of new and course of existing cancer cases.","higher thyroid hormone levels and cancer. this narrative review aims to summarize the relationship between hyperthyroidism, upper reference range thyroid hormone (th) levels, and cancer, and to address the clinical management of hyperthyroidism in cancer patients. a comprehensive search was performed by an independent reviewer through google scholar and pubmed electronic databases. all searches were restricted to english language manuscripts published between 2000 and 2020. numerous in vitro, in vivo, and population-based studies suggest cancer-stimulating effect of triiodothyronine and thyroxin. ths are presented as mediators for tumor growth, proliferation, and progression. many population and case–control studies suggest an increased risk of several solid but also hematologic malignancies in relation to hyperthyroidism and upper normal range th levels. however, results are not unambiguous. in this review, we will summarize population and case–control studies that investigated the relationship between hyperthyroidism, upper reference range th levels, lower thyrotropin (tsh) levels, lower reference range",high thyroid hormone level narrative review summarize relationship hyperthyroidism upper reference range thyroid hormone th level address management hyperthyroidism comprehensive search perform independent reviewer google scholar electronic database search restrict english language manuscript publish numerous vitro vivo population base suggest stimulate effect triiodothyronine thyroxin th present mediator growth proliferation progression many population control suggest increase risk several solid also hematologic malignancy relation hyperthyroidism upper normal range th level however result unambiguous review summarize population control investigate relationship hyperthyroidism upper reference range th level low thyrotropin tsh level low reference range,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Radiofrequency ablation and thyroid nodules: updated systematic review. In the thyroid gland, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is being applied to both benign nodules and cancers internationally, while interest is also growing in the West. Benign thyroid nodules (BTNs) may be candidates for intervention when symptoms develop. For differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC), surgery is currently the first-line treatment. However, for candidates with high surgical risk or those who refuse to undergo repeated surgery, newer techniques such as RFA are an option. Surgery is associated with complications including hypothyroidism, voice change, hypocalcemia, and a scar. RFA has been used in Asian and European institutions as an alternative to surgery, but is relatively new in North America. Although RFA is not associated with significant complications, few randomized control trials have assessed its efficacy. The studies to date suggest a low rate of severe complications and a small need for thyroid hormone replacement following RFA. Further large-scale studies focusing on a Western population are needed. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence with respect to the current studies and data about the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for the management of BTNs and DTC. We systematically searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinical Queries, and Web of Science databases, for articles published up to April 30th, 2020. Total of 75 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Thirty-five studies focused on RFA use for solid nodules, 12 studies on predominantly cystic nodules, 10 for autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, and 18 studied were published on differentiated thyroid cancer. RFA seems to be an effective and safe alternative to surgery in high-risk surgical patients with thyroid cancers and for selected BTNs. Additional trials with longer follow-up in North American patients are needed to validate its full role in the armamentarium of thyroid ologists.","radiofrequency ablation and thyroid nodules: updated systematic review. in the thyroid gland, radiofrequency ablation (rfa) is being applied to both benign nodules and cancers internationally, while interest is also growing in the west. benign thyroid nodules (btns) may be candidates for intervention when symptoms develop. for differentiated thyroid cancers (dtc), surgery is currently the first-line treatment. however, for candidates with high surgical risk or those who refuse to undergo repeated surgery, newer techniques such as rfa are an option. surgery is associated with complications including hypothyroidism, voice change, hypocalcemia, and a scar. rfa has been used in asian and european institutions as an alternative to surgery, but is relatively new in north america. although rfa is not associated with significant complications, few randomized control trials have assessed its efficacy. the studies to date suggest a low rate of severe complications and a small need for thyroid hormone replacement following rfa.",radiofrequency ablation thyroid nodule update systematic review thyroid gland radiofrequency ablation rfa apply benign nodule internationally interest also grow west benign thyroid nodule btns may candidate intervention symptom develop differentiate thyroid dtc surgery currently first line however candidate high surgical risk refuse undergo repeat surgery newer technique rfa option surgery associate complication include hypothyroidism voice change hypocalcemia scar rfa use asian european institution alternative surgery relatively new north america although rfa associate significant complication randomize control trial assess efficacy date suggest low rate severe complication small need thyroid hormone replacement follow rfa,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Clinical characteristics and follow-up of intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer Intracranial metastasis from thyroid cancer is extremely rare. However, less is known about the risk factors for intracranial metastasis and its treatment from few retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of this disease by analyzing patients with intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer. Between 2001 and 2014, the database of the National Cancer Center of Korea was searched for thyroid cancer patients. The clinical characteristics and site of distant metastasis according to the histological type were evaluated in the thyroid cancer cohort. Among the patients with intracranial metastases, the characteristics, histological type of primary cancer and metastatic brain tumor, additional synchronous or previous distant metastasis, treatment modalities, locations and characteristics on radiologic findings, time interval between the first diagnosis of the primary thyroid cancer and brain metastasis, thyroglobulin level at the first detection of intracranial metastasis and survival were reviewed. A total of 10 (0.032 %) out of 3,090 thyroid cancer patients in the National Cancer Center database were identified as having intracranial metastases. The histological types of the primary thyroid cancers were papillary for six patients, follicular for three, and poorly differentiated carcinoma for one. Six of these ten patients underwent surgical resection for intracranial lesions. Whole-brain radiotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors were applied to the patients as postoperative adjuvant treatment, and stereotactic radiosurgery was considered for recurrent or surgically inoperable lesions. The overall median survival time was 33 months (range, 0.5-78 months) after diagnosis of intracranial metastasis. Surgical resection and adjuvant treatments in the contemporary era seem to result in improved survival after intracranial metastases compared with what has been reported in past studies. Considering the grave course of intracranial metastasis, the early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a good performance status are crucial.","clinical characteristics and follow-up of intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer intracranial metastasis from thyroid cancer is extremely rare. however, less is known about the risk factors for intracranial metastasis and its treatment from few retrospective studies. the aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of this disease by analyzing patients with intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer. between 2001 and 2014, the database of the national cancer center of korea was searched for thyroid cancer patients. the clinical characteristics and site of distant metastasis according to the histological type were evaluated in the thyroid cancer cohort. among the patients with intracranial metastases, the characteristics, histological type of primary cancer and metastatic brain tumor, additional synchronous or previous distant metastasis, treatment modalities, locations and characteristics on radiologic findings, time interval between the first diagnosis of the primary thyroid cancer and brain metastasis, thyroglobulin level at the first detection of",characteristic follow intracranial metastasis thyroid intracranial metastasis thyroid extremely rare however less know risk factor intracranial metastasis retrospective contribute understanding analyze intracranial metastasis thyroid database national center korea search thyroid characteristic site distant metastasis accord histological type evaluate thyroid cohort among intracranial metastasis characteristic histological type primary metastatic brain additional synchronous previous distant metastasis modality location characteristic radiologic finding time interval first diagnosis primary thyroid brain metastasis thyroglobulin level first detection,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Papillary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common thyroid malignancy, is associated with an excellent prognosis. Overall survival is more than 90%. The first-line treatment is surgical excision, and although the debate continues as to whether a total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy should be recommended, most patients at the University of California, San Francisco are treated with a total thyroidectomy. Not only has this been shown to be superior for overall survival in select patient populations, but local recurrence is also significantly lower with this approach. Total thyroidectomy also optimizes the adjuvant treatment options that are unique to “differentiated” thyroid cancer because these malignant cells retain many of the features of the native thyroid follicular cell. These cellular features are used for specialized investigations and treatment options in patients with PTC. For example, PTC cells retain the ability to produce thyroglobulin, to be stimulated by thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), and to take up iodine. These features are vital and separate differentiated thyroid cancer from other epithelial malignancies because such features can be used in clinical follow-up (monitoring serum thyroglobulin levels, whole body radioactive iodine scans) and in the treatment of patients with PTC (TSH suppression, radioactive iodine ablation of thyroid remnant, local recurrences, and regional or distant metastases). In summary, the wide array of treatment options for patients with PTC includes surgery, radioactive iodine, thyroid hormone suppression of TSH, external beam radiation (less commonly), and rarely, chemotherapy. This continues to be an area of exciting research for emerging therapy, much of which concentrates on enhancing or re-establishing the differentiated features of the thyroid cancer cell, in an effort to optimize the adjuvant treatment options. The treatment options that are chosen depend on patient factors, disease factors, and the decisions of the patient and treatment team.","papillary thyroid cancer. papillary thyroid cancer (ptc), the most common thyroid malignancy, is associated with an excellent prognosis. overall survival is more than 90%. the first-line treatment is surgical excision, and although the debate continues as to whether a total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy should be recommended, most patients at the university of california, san francisco are treated with a total thyroidectomy. not only has this been shown to be superior for overall survival in select patient populations, but local recurrence is also significantly lower with this approach. total thyroidectomy also optimizes the adjuvant treatment options that are unique to “differentiated” thyroid cancer because these malignant cells retain many of the features of the native thyroid follicular cell. these cellular features are used for specialized investigations and treatment options in patients with ptc. for example, ptc cells retain the ability to produce thyroglobulin, to be stimulated by thyroidstimulating hormone (tsh),",papillary thyroid papillary thyroid ptc common thyroid malignancy associate excellent prognosis overall survival first line surgical excision although debate continue whether total thyroidectomy thyroid lobectomy recommend university california san francisco treat total thyroidectomy show superior overall survival select population local recurrence also significantly low approach total thyroidectomy also optimize adjuvant option unique differentiate thyroid malignant cell retain many feature native thyroid follicular cell cellular feature use specialized investigation option ptc example ptc cell retain ability produce thyroglobulin stimulate thyroidstimulating hormone tsh,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B differentially affects thyroid cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and invasion Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a key role in promoting cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Our understanding of NF-κB signaling in thyroid cancer, however, is limited. In this study, we have investigated the role of NF-κB signaling in thyroid cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis using selective genetic inhibition of NF-κB in advanced thyroid cancer cell lines. Three pharmacologic inhibitors of NF-κB differentially inhibited growth in a panel of advanced thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting that these NF-κB inhibitors may have off-target effects. We therefore used a selective genetic approach to inhibit NF-κB signaling by overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα (mIκBα). These studies revealed decreased cell growth in only one of five thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C), which occurred through a block in the S-G2/M transition. Resistance to TNFα-induced apoptosis was observed in all cell lines, likely through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of NF-κB by mIκBα sensitized a subset of cell lines to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Sensitive cell lines displayed sustained activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, defining a potential mechanism of response. Finally, NF-κB inhibition by mIκBα expression differentially reduced thyroid cancer cell invasion in these thyroid cancer cell lines. Sensitive cell lines demonstrated approximately a two-fold decrease in invasion, which was associated with differential expression of MMP-13. MMP-9 was reduced by mIκBα expression in all cell lines tested. These data indicate that selective inhibition of NF-κB represents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced thyroid. However, it is apparent that global regulation of thyroid cancer cell growth and invasion is not achieved by NF-κB signaling alone. Instead, our findings suggest that other important molecular processes play a critical role in defining the extent of NF-κB function within cancer cells.","inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa b differentially affects thyroid cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and invasion nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a key role in promoting cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. our understanding of nf-κb signaling in thyroid cancer, however, is limited. in this study, we have investigated the role of nf-κb signaling in thyroid cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis using selective genetic inhibition of nf-κb in advanced thyroid cancer cell lines. three pharmacologic inhibitors of nf-κb differentially inhibited growth in a panel of advanced thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting that these nf-κb inhibitors may have off-target effects. we therefore used a selective genetic approach to inhibit nf-κb signaling by overexpression of a dominant-negative iκbα (miκbα). these studies revealed decreased cell growth in only one of five thyroid cancer cell lines (8505c), which occurred through a block in the s-g2/m transition. resistance to tnfα-induced apoptosis",inhibition nuclear factor kappa b differentially affect thyroid cell growth apoptosis invasion nuclear factor b nf b constitutively activate many play key role promote cell proliferation survival invasion understanding nf b signal thyroid however limit investigate role nf b signal thyroid cell proliferation invasion apoptosis use selective genetic inhibition nf b advanced thyroid cell line three pharmacologic inhibitor nf b differentially inhibited growth panel advanced thyroid cell line suggest nf b inhibitor may target effect therefore use selective genetic approach inhibit nf b signaling overexpression dominant negative b mi b reveal decrease cell growth one five thyroid cell line c occur block g transition resistance tnf induced apoptosis,e,Thyroid Cancer
"METTL3 inhibition induced by M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles drives anti-PD-1 therapy resistance via M6A-CD70-mediated immune suppression in thyroid cancer. The treatment options for advanced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) refractory to standard therapies are limited. Although anti-PD-1 therapy has a manageable safety profile and has been effective in a small percentage of patients with advanced PTC and refractory ATC, the majority of the patients either do not respond or develop resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is a critical determinant of the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it is unclear whether and how m6A modification in tumor cells shapes the immune landscape of PTC and ATC. In this study, we performed bulk and single cell RNA sequencing analysis of PTC and ATC tissues, and found that low METTL3 expression not only correlated to poor response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) but was also associated with increased TNF family-related ligand-receptor interactions in the immunosuppressive Tregs and exhausted T cells. Furthermore, overexpression of METTL3 in PTC and ATC cells enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell humanized NCG (huPBMC-NCG) mouse model. Mechanistically, M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2 EVs) inhibited METTL3 expression in PTC and ATC cells via miR-21-5p. Downregulation of METTL3 promoted demethylation of CD70 mRNA, which prevented YTHDF2-mediated degradation of the transcripts. The stabilization of CD70 mRNA, and the subsequent upregulation in CD70 protein levels increased the abundance of the immunosuppressive Tregs and terminally exhausted T cells, thereby inducing resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, blocking CD70 using cusatuzumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody, reversed the anti-PD-1 therapy resistance induced by M2 EVs in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that METTL3 expression negatively correlated with CD70 expression and M2 macrophages and Tregs infiltration in PTC and ATC tissues. Our findings provide new insights into developing novel therapies for advanced PTC and ATC.","mettl3 inhibition induced by m2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles drives anti-pd-1 therapy resistance via m6a-cd70-mediated immune suppression in thyroid cancer. the treatment options for advanced papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) refractory to standard therapies are limited. although anti-pd-1 therapy has a manageable safety profile and has been effective in a small percentage of patients with advanced ptc and refractory atc, the majority of the patients either do not respond or develop resistance to anti-pd-1 therapy. n6-methyladenosine (m6a) modification is a critical determinant of the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (tme). however, it is unclear whether and how m6a modification in tumor cells shapes the immune landscape of ptc and atc. in this study, we performed bulk and single cell rna sequencing analysis of ptc and atc tissues, and found that low mettl3 expression not only correlated to poor response to immune checkpoint blockade (icb) but was also",mettl inhibition induce macrophage derive extracellular vesicle drive anti pd therapy resistance via cd mediate immune suppression thyroid option advanced papillary thyroid ptc anaplastic thyroid atc refractory standard therapy limit although anti pd therapy manageable safety profile effective small percentage advanced ptc refractory atc majority either respond develop resistance anti pd therapy n methyladenosine modification critical determinant complexity microenvironment tme however unclear whether modification cell shape immune landscape ptc atc perform bulk single cell rna sequence ptc atc tissue find low mettl expression correlate poor response immune checkpoint blockade icb also,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Residual Thyroid Tissue on Postoperative Diagnostic 131 I Radioactive Whole-Body Scan After Surgery in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Tertiary Referral Centre Experience Residual thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy in differentiated thyroid cancers is considered an independent risk factor for recurrence. Guidelines recommend following up patients after surgery with thyroglobulin (Tg), neck ultrasonography, and occasionally whole-body radioactive scan. However, the results of serum thyroglobulin and whole-body radioiodine scan are often discordant. The present study was undertaken to determine the levels of serum-stimulated thyroglobulin to complement the findings of residual thyroid tissue in the radioactive whole-body scan. One hundred twenty-six patients had undergone a radioiodine (131 I) whole-body scan (WBS) during the study duration, and 121 were available for analysis. The thyroglobulin level (measured by the CLIA method) was recorded at the time of these scans. The data was analysed to determine the level of stimulated thyroglobulin correlating with residual thyroid tissue, locoregional, and distant metastasis as assessed by WBS. The presence of residual thyroid tissue was noted in an overwhelmingly high 94% of cases. Twenty-four of the 28 patients with stimulated Tg < 2 ng/dl had residual thyroid tissue on a WBS. The discordancy rate (positive moderate — large WBS and negative serum thyroglobulin) of 64.28% was seen. Using ROC the serum thyroglobulin cut-offs levels for the loco-regional disease were found to be 27.705 ng/dl and 94.770 ng/dl for distant metastasis. The results highlight the fact that serum Tg levels cannot be used as an accurate predictor of the extent of the remnant thyroid tissue. Irrespective of the quality of surgery, which was analysed based on the centre and surgical specialty, over 90% of cases had residual thyroid tissue on WBS. The use of only stimulated Tg levels for follow-up may be inaccurate. Serum Tg is a useful test along with radioactive whole-body scans to distinguish local disease, loco-regional disease, and distant metastasis.","residual thyroid tissue on postoperative diagnostic 131 i radioactive whole-body scan after surgery in differentiated thyroid cancer: a tertiary referral centre experience residual thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy in differentiated thyroid cancers is considered an independent risk factor for recurrence. guidelines recommend following up patients after surgery with thyroglobulin (tg), neck ultrasonography, and occasionally whole-body radioactive scan. however, the results of serum thyroglobulin and whole-body radioiodine scan are often discordant. the present study was undertaken to determine the levels of serum-stimulated thyroglobulin to complement the findings of residual thyroid tissue in the radioactive whole-body scan. one hundred twenty-six patients had undergone a radioiodine (131 i) whole-body scan (wbs) during the study duration, and 121 were available for analysis. the thyroglobulin level (measured by the clia method) was recorded at the time of these scans. the data was analysed to determine the level of stimulated thyroglobulin correlating with residual thyroid tissue,",residual thyroid tissue postoperative diagnostic radioactive whole body scan surgery differentiated thyroid tertiary referral centre experience residual thyroid tissue total thyroidectomy differentiated thyroid consider independent risk factor recurrence guideline recommend follow surgery thyroglobulin tg neck ultrasonography occasionally whole body radioactive scan however result serum thyroglobulin whole body radioiodine scan often discordant present undertake determine level serum stimulate thyroglobulin complement finding residual thyroid tissue radioactive whole body scan one hundred twenty six undergone radioiodine whole body scan wb duration available thyroglobulin level measure clia method record time scan data analyse determine level stimulated thyroglobulin correlate residual thyroid tissue,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Lymph node and distant metastases of thyroid gland cancer. Metastases in the thyroid glands The different biological features of the various major entities of thyroid cancer, e.g. papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, anaplastic and medullary, depend to a large extent on their different metastatic spread. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has a propensity for cervical lymphatic spread that occurs in 20-50 % of patients whereas distant metastasis occurs in < 5 % of cases. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be the first symptom particularly of (micro) PTC. In contrast follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) has a marked propensity for vascular but not lymphatic invasion and 10-20 % of FTC develop distant metastases. At the time of diagnosis approximately one third of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases show lymph node metastases, in 10-15 % distant metastases and 25 % develop metastases during the course of the disease. Poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) spread via both lymphatic and vascular invasion. Thus distant metastases are relatively uncommon in DTC and when they occur, long-term stable disease is the typical clinical course. The major sites of distant metastases are the lungs and bone. Metastases to the brain, breasts, liver, kidneys, muscle and skin are relatively rare or even rare. The thyroid gland itself can be a site of metastases from a variety of other tumors. In autopsy series of patients with disseminated cancer disease, metastases to the thyroid gland were found in up to 10 % of cases. Metastases from other primary tumors to the thyroid gland have been reported in 1.4-3 % of patients who have surgery for suspected cancer of the thyroid gland. The most common primary cancers that metastasize to the thyroid gland are renal cell (48.1 %), colorectal (10.4 %), lung (8.3 %) and breast cancer (7.8 %) and surprisingly often sarcomas (4.0 %).","lymph node and distant metastases of thyroid gland cancer. metastases in the thyroid glands the different biological features of the various major entities of thyroid cancer, e.g. papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, anaplastic and medullary, depend to a large extent on their different metastatic spread. papillary thyroid cancer (ptc) has a propensity for cervical lymphatic spread that occurs in 20-50 % of patients whereas distant metastasis occurs in < 5 % of cases. cervical lymphadenopathy may be the first symptom particularly of (micro) ptc. in contrast follicular thyroid cancer (ftc) has a marked propensity for vascular but not lymphatic invasion and 10-20 % of ftc develop distant metastases. at the time of diagnosis approximately one third of medullary thyroid cancer (mtc) cases show lymph node metastases, in 10-15 % distant metastases and 25 % develop metastases during the course of the disease. poorly differentiated (pdtc) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (atc) spread",lymph node distant metastasis thyroid gland metastases thyroid glands different biological feature various major entity thyroid e g papillary follicular poorly differentiate anaplastic medullary depend large extent different metastatic spread papillary thyroid ptc propensity cervical lymphatic spread occur whereas distant metastasis occur cervical lymphadenopathy may first symptom particularly micro ptc contrast follicular thyroid ftc marked propensity vascular lymphatic invasion ftc develop distant metastasis time diagnosis approximately one third medullary thyroid mtc show lymph node metastasis distant metastasis develop metastasis course poorly differentiate pdtc anaplastic thyroid atc spread,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer incidence in cohorts exposed in childhood to 131I released during the Windscale nuclear reactor accident at Sellafield, England, in 1957. A fire in one of the Windscale nuclear reactors at Sellafield (Cumbria, England) in October 1957 released 1,800 TBq of <sup>131</sup>I (half-life, 8 days) to atmosphere. Measurements of <sup>131</sup>I activity in thyroids of exposed children showed typical thyroid doses of tens of milligray, but with some exceeding 100 mGy. Radiation exposure in childhood is known to increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Consequently, an investigation was conducted into whether raised numbers of thyroid cancer cases occurred in those exposed to <sup>131</sup>I as young children in Cumbria. A database of Cumbrian births from 1950 onwards allowed cohorts of 56,086 births during 1950-1958 and 137,444 births during 1959-1980 to be constructed, periods including children potentially exposed and unexposed, respectively, to <sup>131</sup>I. Three areas of Cumbria with different <sup>131</sup>I contamination levels were identified from monitoring data, and births assigned to these three areas for the two periods of birth. Members of these six sub-cohorts were linked to incident thyroid cancer cases in Great Britain during 1981-2020 using national cancer registration databases, providing thyroid cancer incidence rates. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with the lowest contamination area as a reference, were computed. No IRR differed discernibly from unity. For births during 1950-1958, the IRR for the combined highest and intermediate <sup>131</sup>I contamination areas was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 1.56), and no case of thyroid cancer was found in the small cohort born in the highest contamination area. In conclusion, no increased risk of thyroid cancer in those exposed to <sup>131</sup>I as young children in Cumbria in 1957 was detected. This study adds to the evidence on the long-term risk of thyroid cancer following childhood exposure to low and moderate levels of <sup>131</sup>I, such as occurred following the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011.","thyroid cancer incidence in cohorts exposed in childhood to 131i released during the windscale nuclear reactor accident at sellafield, england, in 1957. a fire in one of the windscale nuclear reactors at sellafield (cumbria, england) in october 1957 released 1,800 tbq of 131 i (half-life, 8 days) to atmosphere. measurements of 131 i activity in thyroids of exposed children showed typical thyroid doses of tens of milligray, but with some exceeding 100 mgy. radiation exposure in childhood is known to increase the risk of thyroid cancer. consequently, an investigation was conducted into whether raised numbers of thyroid cancer cases occurred in those exposed to 131 i as young children in cumbria. a database of cumbrian births from 1950 onwards allowed cohorts of 56,086 births during 1950-1958 and 137,444 births during 1959-1980 to be constructed, periods including children potentially exposed and unexposed, respectively, to 131 i. three areas of cumbria with",thyroid incidence cohort expose childhood release windscale nuclear reactor accident sellafield england fire one windscale nuclear reactor sellafield cumbria england october release tbq half life day atmosphere measurement activity thyroid exposed child show typical thyroid dos ten milligray exceed mgy radiation exposure childhood know increase risk thyroid consequently investigation conduct whether raised number thyroid occur expose young child cumbria database cumbrian birth onwards allow cohort birth birth construct period include child potentially expose unexposed respectively three area cumbria,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Palate invasion in cT3/4 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma: a study of at least 5-year follow-up. Background The prognostic significance of palate invasion in cT3/4N0 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (MS-SCC) remains ambiguous. This study endeavors to elucidate the impact of palate invasion on the prognosis of cT3/4N0 MS-SCC and to ascertain whether diverse neck management strategies modulate this effect. Methods A retrospective analysis was undertaken on a cohort of patients with surgically managed cT3/4N0 MS-SCC, all of whom had a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. The influence of palate invasion on locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) was scrutinized using the Cox proportional hazards model. Additionally, the relationship between palate invasion and occult metastasis was evaluated through logistic regression analysis. Results The study encompassed 133 patients, among whom 39 (29.3%) exhibited palate invasion. Elective neck dissection was performed in 58 patients, while the remaining subjects received elective neck irradiation. The Cox model for LRC revealed that patients with palate invasion faced a significantly elevated risk of locoregional recurrence (HR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.17–1.90) compared to those without palate invasion. Similarly, the hazard ratio for palate invasion in the OS model was 1.64 (95%CI: 1.20–1.98), indicating a significantly poorer prognosis in cases with palate invasion. Both elective neck dissection and elective neck irradiation demonstrated comparable LRC and OS outcomes in patients with and without palate invasion. Occult metastasis was detected in 12 patients, and those with palate invasion exhibited nearly a one-fold increase in the risk of lymph node (LN) metastasis (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24–3.11) relative to those without palate invasion. Conclusion Palate invasion exerts a significantly adverse effect on both occult metastasis and overall prognosis. However, its influence on prognosis appears to be mitigated when elective neck dissection or elective neck irradiation is employed, suggesting a limited impact under these management strategies.","palate invasion in ct3/4 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma: a study of at least 5-year follow-up. background the prognostic significance of palate invasion in ct3/4n0 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (ms-scc) remains ambiguous. this study endeavors to elucidate the impact of palate invasion on the prognosis of ct3/4n0 ms-scc and to ascertain whether diverse neck management strategies modulate this effect. methods a retrospective analysis was undertaken on a cohort of patients with surgically managed ct3/4n0 ms-scc, all of whom had a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. the influence of palate invasion on locoregional control (lrc) and overall survival (os) was scrutinized using the cox proportional hazards model. additionally, the relationship between palate invasion and occult metastasis was evaluated through logistic regression analysis. results the study encompassed 133 patients, among whom 39 (29.3%) exhibited palate invasion. elective neck dissection was performed in 58 patients, while the remaining subjects received elective",palate invasion ct maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma least year follow prognostic significance palate invasion ct n maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma scc remain ambiguous endeavor elucidate impact palate invasion prognosis ct n scc ascertain whether diverse neck management strategy modulate effect retrospective undertake cohort surgically manage ct n scc minimum follow period year influence palate invasion locoregional control lrc overall survival scrutinize use cox proportional hazard model additionally relationship palate invasion occult metastasis evaluate logistic regression result encompass among exhibit palate invasion elective neck dissection perform remain subject receive elective,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid disease and cancer in kidney transplantation: a single-center analysis Thyroid diseases are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease, but data on renal transplant recipients are conflicting. This study evaluated the incidence of thyroid disease and cancer in a population of kidney transplant recipients performed in a single center. Seven hundred sixty patients receiving a kidney transplantation between January 2000 and October 2017 were followed with thyroid ultrasonography to determine nodules together with thyroid hormone levels. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration citology (FNAc) was performed to the nodules > 10 mm . Two hundred four patients (26.8%) patients demonstrated functional or morphologic changes in the thyroid gland compared with pre-transplant period. Among the 204 patients with newly diagnosed thyroid disease, 165 patients had single or multiple nodular lesions less than 1 cm in diameter, and were followed yearly. Nodule size progression was observed in 23 patients (13.9%), and they underwent a FNAc. A total of sixty-two patients (30.3%) underwent FNAc. The biopsy samples were cytologically interpreted as benign in 20 patients (32.2%), suspicious in 40 patients (64.5%), or at high risk of cancer in 2 patients (3.2%). Forty-two patients underwent total thyroidectomy. At histological examination, 18 patients had a thyroid cancer (papillary cancer in 17 patients, follicular cancer in one). Thyroid cancer was more frequent in male patients with a mean time from transplant to diagnosis of 5.6 years. At a mean follow-up was 8 ± 1.2 years, all patients are alive with a normal functioning graft. Thyroid diseases are common in transplant recipients. Thyroid disease may evolve after transplantation, probably as a consequence of immunosuppression. A complete evaluation of thyroid disease is mandatory in kidney transplant recipients because early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of thyroid disease and cancer may significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality in these patients.","thyroid disease and cancer in kidney transplantation: a single-center analysis thyroid diseases are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease, but data on renal transplant recipients are conflicting. this study evaluated the incidence of thyroid disease and cancer in a population of kidney transplant recipients performed in a single center. seven hundred sixty patients receiving a kidney transplantation between january 2000 and october 2017 were followed with thyroid ultrasonography to determine nodules together with thyroid hormone levels. ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration citology (fnac) was performed to the nodules > 10 mm . two hundred four patients (26.8%) patients demonstrated functional or morphologic changes in the thyroid gland compared with pre-transplant period. among the 204 patients with newly diagnosed thyroid disease, 165 patients had single or multiple nodular lesions less than 1 cm in diameter, and were followed yearly. nodule size progression was observed in 23 patients (13.9%), and they underwent a",thyroid kidney transplantation single center thyroid frequent end stage renal data renal transplant recipient conflict evaluate incidence thyroid population kidney transplant recipient perform single center seven hundred sixty receive kidney transplantation january october follow thyroid ultrasonography determine nodule together thyroid hormone level ultrasound guide fine needle aspiration citology fnac perform nodule mm two hundred four demonstrate functional morphologic change thyroid gland compare pre transplant period among newly diagnose thyroid single multiple nodular lesion less cm diameter follow yearly nodule size progression observe undergo,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Evidence of increased chromosomal abnormalities in French Polynesian thyroid cancer patients The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in thyroid cancer patients before and after radioactive iodine administration in order to assess cytogenetic particularity in Polynesian thyroid cancer patients. Chromosomal abnormalities were studied in 30 Polynesian patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, prior to and 4 days after 131I administration. Unstable chromosomal abnormalities were counted in peripheral blood lymphocytes using a conventional cytogenetic method. Peripheral blood was irradiated in vitro at different doses (0.5, 1 and 2 Gy) in order to establish the dose-response of the lymphocytes. Control groups were composed of 50 European thyroid cancer patients before and after first administration of 131I, and of ten European healthy donors. In addition, in vitro irradiation assays were performed at different doses (0.5, 1 and 2 Gy). The relative risk of spontaneous dicentrics before any radiation treatment was 2.9 (95% CI 1.7–5.1) times higher among Polynesian thyroid patients than among European thyroid cancer patients. After in vitro irradiation, the rise in frequency of dicentrics was similar in the Polynesian thyroid cancer group and the European thyroid patients and healthy donors. Four days after administration of 3.7 GBq 131I, the relative risk for a dicentric per cell was 1.3 (95% CI 1.0–1.5) times higher in Polynesian than in European patients. This can be explained by higher 131I retention in Polynesian compared with European patients. The results obtained revealed an increased frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in Polynesian thyroid cancer patients compared with European control patients. These preliminary findings are compatible with possible previous environmental aggression and therefore imply a need for further investigations on larger series including, in particular, French Polynesian healthy donors. In addition to French Polynesians, Maori and Hawaiian control groups could be useful.","evidence of increased chromosomal abnormalities in french polynesian thyroid cancer patients the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in thyroid cancer patients before and after radioactive iodine administration in order to assess cytogenetic particularity in polynesian thyroid cancer patients. chromosomal abnormalities were studied in 30 polynesian patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, prior to and 4 days after 131i administration. unstable chromosomal abnormalities were counted in peripheral blood lymphocytes using a conventional cytogenetic method. peripheral blood was irradiated in vitro at different doses (0.5, 1 and 2 gy) in order to establish the dose-response of the lymphocytes. control groups were composed of 50 european thyroid cancer patients before and after first administration of 131i, and of ten european healthy donors. in addition, in vitro irradiation assays were performed at different doses (0.5, 1 and 2 gy). the relative risk of spontaneous dicentrics before any radiation",evidence increase chromosomal abnormality french polynesian thyroid evaluate frequency chromosomal abnormality thyroid radioactive iodine administration order assess cytogenetic particularity polynesian thyroid chromosomal abnormality polynesian differentiated thyroid prior day administration unstable chromosomal abnormality count peripheral blood lymphocyte use conventional cytogenetic method peripheral blood irradiate vitro different dos gy order establish dose response lymphocyte control group compose european thyroid first administration ten european healthy donor addition vitro irradiation assay perform different dos gy relative risk spontaneous dicentrics radiation,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Can computed tomography scanning in adults lead to an increased risk of thyroid cancer? A nationwide nested case-control study. To evaluate the association between computed tomography (CT) scanning and newly diagnosed thyroid cancer cases in relation to the confounding effect of the healthcare utilization rate. This nested case–control study used the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort 2002–2015: 3557 adult thyroid cancer cases were matched to 17,785 controls by age, sex, and diagnosis date. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for thyroid cancer associated with cumulative exposure to CT scanning > 3 years before cancer diagnosis. Changes in estimated ORs with and without adjustment for outpatient visit frequency were investigated. ORs for newly diagnosed thyroid cancer increased according to the higher number of total CT scans and thyroid-exposing CT scans (CT scans of the head, neck, or chest compartment; OR and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 [1.03–1.16] and 1.28 [1.05–1.57], respectively). ORs for thyroid cancer increased according to higher outpatient visit frequency. The association between thyroid cancer incidence and CT scans became insignificant when outpatient visit frequency was adjusted in the models (OR [95% CI], 1.03 [0.97–1.10]: total CT scans, 1.14 [0.93–1.41]: thyroid-exposing CT scans). Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, and history of other malignancies did not reveal independent associations between CT scanning and thyroid cancer. The high incidence of thyroid cancer in adults exposed to ionizing radiation during CT scanning can be largely explained by the confounding effect of the healthcare utilization rate. These effects should be considered to avoid overestimation of the CT scanning–associated risk of thyroid cancer. • Studies indicate that diagnostic imaging using low-ionizing radiation may increase risks for thyroid cancer in adults. • Our findings suggest that the risk for radiation-induced thyroid cancer following CT scanning in adults may have been overestimated in observational studies due to medical surveillance–related biases.","can computed tomography scanning in adults lead to an increased risk of thyroid cancer? a nationwide nested case-control study. to evaluate the association between computed tomography (ct) scanning and newly diagnosed thyroid cancer cases in relation to the confounding effect of the healthcare utilization rate. this nested case–control study used the korean national health insurance service-national sample cohort 2002–2015: 3557 adult thyroid cancer cases were matched to 17,785 controls by age, sex, and diagnosis date. odds ratios (ors) were estimated for thyroid cancer associated with cumulative exposure to ct scanning > 3 years before cancer diagnosis. changes in estimated ors with and without adjustment for outpatient visit frequency were investigated. ors for newly diagnosed thyroid cancer increased according to the higher number of total ct scans and thyroid-exposing ct scans (ct scans of the head, neck, or chest compartment; or and 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.09 [1.03–1.16] and 1.28 [1.05–1.57],",compute tomography scan adult lead increase risk thyroid nationwide nested control evaluate association compute tomography ct scanning newly diagnose thyroid relation confound effect healthcare utilization rate nested control use korean national health insurance service national sample cohort adult thyroid match control age sex diagnosis date odds ratios estimate thyroid associate cumulative exposure ct scan year diagnosis change estimate without adjustment outpatient visit frequency investigated newly diagnose thyroid increase accord high number total ct scan thyroid expose ct scan ct scan head neck chest compartment confidence interval ci,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Synergistic effect of metformin and vemurufenib (PLX4032) as a molecular targeted therapy in anaplastic thyroid cancer: an in vitro study. Survival rate of patients affected with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is less than 5% with current treatment. In ATC, BRAFV600E mutation is the major mutation that results in the transformation of normal cells in to an undifferentiated cancer cells via aberrant molecular signaling mechanisms. Although vemurufenib is a selective oral drug for the BRAFV600E mutant kinase with a response rate of nearly 50% in metastatic melanoma, our study has showed resistance to this drug in ATC. Hence the rationale of the study is to explore combinational therapeutic effect to improve the efficacy of vemurafenib along with metformin. Metformin, a diabetic drug is an AMPK activator and has recently proved to be involved in preventing or treating several types of cancer. Using iGEMDock software, a protein–ligand interaction was successful between Metformin and TSHR (receptor present in the thyroid follicular cells). Our study demonstrates that combination of vemurufenib with metformin has synergistic anti-cancer effects which was evaluated through MTT assay (cytotoxicity), colony formation assay (antiproliferation evaluation) and suppressed the progression of ATC cells growth by inducing significant apoptosis, proven by Annexin V-FITC assay (Early Apoptosis Detection). Downregulation of ERK signaling, upregulation of AMPK pathway and precision in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway which were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot provide the evidence that the combination of drugs involved in the precision of altered molecular signaling Further our results suggest that Metformin act as a demethylating agent in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells by inducing the expression of NIS and TSHR. Our study for the first time explored cAMP signaling in ATC wherein cAMP signaling is downregulated due to decrease in intracellular cAMP level upon metformin treatment. To conclude, our findings demonstrate novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies for undifferentiated ATC.","synergistic effect of metformin and vemurufenib (plx4032) as a molecular targeted therapy in anaplastic thyroid cancer: an in vitro study. survival rate of patients affected with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (atc) is less than 5% with current treatment. in atc, brafv600e mutation is the major mutation that results in the transformation of normal cells in to an undifferentiated cancer cells via aberrant molecular signaling mechanisms. although vemurufenib is a selective oral drug for the brafv600e mutant kinase with a response rate of nearly 50% in metastatic melanoma, our study has showed resistance to this drug in atc. hence the rationale of the study is to explore combinational therapeutic effect to improve the efficacy of vemurafenib along with metformin. metformin, a diabetic drug is an ampk activator and has recently proved to be involved in preventing or treating several types of cancer. using igemdock software, a protein–ligand interaction was successful between metformin",synergistic effect metformin vemurufenib plx molecular targeted therapy anaplastic thyroid vitro survival rate affect anaplastic thyroid carcinoma atc less current atc brafv e mutation major mutation result transformation normal cell undifferentiated cell via aberrant molecular signal mechanism although vemurufenib selective oral drug brafv e mutant kinase response rate nearly metastatic melanoma show resistance drug atc hence rationale explore combinational therapeutic effect improve efficacy vemurafenib along metformin metformin diabetic drug ampk activator recently prove involve prevent treat several type use igemdock software protein ligand interaction successful metformin,e,Thyroid Cancer

"The acceleration in papillary thyroid cancer incidence rates is similar among racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Reports of similar age-specific incidence rates and a female-to-male gender disparity by racial/ethnic groups suggests that further consideration of race-specific patterns may confer insight into the possible causes of thyroid cancer or explanations for the increase in incidence. We used the National Cancer Institute’s (NCIs) surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program and Joinpoint Regression for cases diagnosed during 1992–2009 to investigate trends and rates of acceleration for papillary thyroid cancer by gender and race/ethnicity. We determined the annual percent change (APC) and found a yearly increase of 7.0 % for papillary thyroid cancer for the most recent APC trend, with an APC of 6.3 and 7.1 % for white males and females, respectively; an APC of 4.3 and 8.4 % for black males and females, respectively; an APC of 4.2 and 6.7 % for Hispanic males and females, respectively; and an APC of 3.4 and 6.4 % in Asian/PI males and females, respectively. The APC projections show the rates of papillary thyroid cancer rising in males, but the patterns are more dramatic in females, with rates of papillary thyroid cancer in females surpassing rates of common cancers and becoming the third most common cancer in women of all ages by 2019. Although the lowest rates of thyroid cancer are observed in blacks, the greatest rate of acceleration is occurring in black females. Our data also show that the rate of papillary thyroid cancer will continue to surpass rates of ovarian cancer, and in white women: it is projected to be more incident than colorectal cancer as well; and in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women, rates of papillary thyroid cancer are projected to be higher than lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers in the near future.","the acceleration in papillary thyroid cancer incidence rates is similar among racial and ethnic groups in the united states. reports of similar age-specific incidence rates and a female-to-male gender disparity by racial/ethnic groups suggests that further consideration of race-specific patterns may confer insight into the possible causes of thyroid cancer or explanations for the increase in incidence. we used the national cancer institute’s (ncis) surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program and joinpoint regression for cases diagnosed during 1992–2009 to investigate trends and rates of acceleration for papillary thyroid cancer by gender and race/ethnicity. we determined the annual percent change (apc) and found a yearly increase of 7.0 % for papillary thyroid cancer for the most recent apc trend, with an apc of 6.3 and 7.1 % for white males and females, respectively; an apc of 4.3 and 8.4 % for black males and females, respectively; an apc of 4.2",acceleration papillary thyroid incidence rate similar among racial ethnic group united state report similar age specific incidence rate female male gender disparity racial ethnic group suggest consideration race specific pattern may confer insight possible cause thyroid explanation increase incidence use national institute ncis surveillance epidemiology end result seer program joinpoint regression diagnose investigate trend rate acceleration papillary thyroid gender race ethnicity determine annual percent change apc find yearly increase papillary thyroid recent apc trend apc white male female respectively apc black male female respectively apc,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Are endogenously lower serum thyroid hormones new predictors for thyroid malignancy in addition to higher serum thyrotropin It is well known that TSH plays a major role in the secretion of thyroid hormones, maintenance of thyroid specific gene expression, and gland growth. In this study, we aimed to evaluate association between tests of thyroid functions (fT3, fT4, TSH) and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. 441 patients operated for nodular goiter between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed. Thyroid functions were studied in the period of 1-30 days prior to surgery. In postoperative histopathological examination, differentiated thyroid carcinoma and benign thyroid disease were detected in 166 (37.6%) and 275 (62.4%) patients, respectively. Patients with thyroid malignancy had significantly lower serum fT3 (P = 0.001), lower fT4 (P = 0.022), and higher TSH levels (P < 0.001) compared to patients with benign disease, although all analytes were within the normal range. We subdivided by quartile serum fT3, fT4, and TSH in normal limits into three groups. The odds ratio (ORs) for the risk of thyroid cancer with a serum TSH between 0.63 and 1.67 μIU/ml and 1.68-4.00 μIU/ml, compared with a serum TSH between 0.40 and 0.62 μIU/ml were calculated as 2.60 (95% CIs 1.49-4.54) and 6.50 (95% CIs 3.51-12.03), respectively. There was also a greater risk of thyroid cancer in patients with fT3 levels of 1.57-3.00 pg/ml, compared with patients with fT3 levels of 3.89-4.71 pg/ml (OR 2.95, 95% CIs 1.68-5.20). For fT4, OR for the risk of thyroid cancer between 0.85 and 1.17 ng/dl compared with 1.48-1.78 ng/dl was 2.14 (95% CIs 1.22-3.74). In conclusion, lower fT3, fT4, and higher TSH concentrations within normal limits were related with increased thyroid cancer independent from sex and nodule type. Particularly, the association between lower fT3, fT4 levels and a diagnosis of thyroid cancer is a novel finding.","are endogenously lower serum thyroid hormones new predictors for thyroid malignancy in addition to higher serum thyrotropin it is well known that tsh plays a major role in the secretion of thyroid hormones, maintenance of thyroid specific gene expression, and gland growth. in this study, we aimed to evaluate association between tests of thyroid functions (ft3, ft4, tsh) and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. 441 patients operated for nodular goiter between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed. thyroid functions were studied in the period of 1-30 days prior to surgery. in postoperative histopathological examination, differentiated thyroid carcinoma and benign thyroid disease were detected in 166 (37.6%) and 275 (62.4%) patients, respectively. patients with thyroid malignancy had significantly lower serum ft3 (p = 0.001), lower ft4 (p = 0.022), and higher tsh levels (p < 0.001) compared to patients with benign disease, although all analytes were within the normal range. we subdivided by quartile",endogenously low serum thyroid hormones new predictor thyroid malignancy addition high serum thyrotropin well know tsh play major role secretion thyroid hormone maintenance thyroid specific gene expression gland growth evaluate association test thyroid function ft ft tsh differentiate thyroid carcinoma operate nodular goiter analyze thyroid function period day prior surgery postoperative histopathological examination differentiate thyroid carcinoma benign thyroid detect respectively thyroid malignancy significantly low serum ft p lower ft p high tsh level p compare benign although analytes within normal range subdivide quartile,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Tangeretin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in thyroid cancer cells. Thyroid cancer is a malignant tumor whose incidence is increasing worldwide. While thyroid cancer is treatable and curable, a small number of cases can become metastatic when cancer cells originating in the thyroid gland spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. The most common treatments for thyroid cancer are resection and radioactive iodine therapy. However, these treatments have side effects, such as hypothyroidism and damage to normal non-cancerous cells. Tangeretin is a polymethoxylated flavone found in the peel of citrus plants and has biological activity, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. However, the effects of tangeretin on human thyroid cancer have not been investigated. In this study, the effects of tangeretin on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell line SNU-790 were investigated. To prove the results of this study, A water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay, cell cycle arrest assay, annexin V/PI, DCF-DA, JC-10, and western blot were used. Treatment with tangeretin decreased SNU-790 cell viability and proliferation ability. Annexin V/PI staining showed that tangeretin increased apoptotic cell death. In the wound healing assay, the tangeretin treatment decreased the wound closure area. In addition, tangeretin treatment increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytosolic of SNU-790. The JC-10 assay showed that the tangeretin treatment decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with tangeretin increased the expression of the tumor protein p53. In conclusion, these results indicated that tangeretin inhibited the progression of thyroid cancer in SNU-790 cells by inhibiting migration ability, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, and mediating oxidative stress in SNU-790. Hence, this study provides experimental evidence that tangeretin could be a potential candidate for the management of thyroid cancer.","tangeretin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in thyroid cancer cells. thyroid cancer is a malignant tumor whose incidence is increasing worldwide. while thyroid cancer is treatable and curable, a small number of cases can become metastatic when cancer cells originating in the thyroid gland spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. the most common treatments for thyroid cancer are resection and radioactive iodine therapy. however, these treatments have side effects, such as hypothyroidism and damage to normal non-cancerous cells. tangeretin is a polymethoxylated flavone found in the peel of citrus plants and has biological activity, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. however, the effects of tangeretin on human thyroid cancer have not been investigated. in this study, the effects of tangeretin on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell line snu-790 were investigated. to prove the results of this study, a",tangeretin induces apoptosis cell cycle arrest thyroid cell thyroid malignant whose incidence increase worldwide thyroid treatable curable small number become metastatic cell originate thyroid gland spread part body bloodstream lymphatic system common thyroid resection radioactive iodine therapy however side effect hypothyroidism damage normal non cancerous cell tangeretin polymethoxylated flavone find peel citrus plant biological activity include antioxidant anti inflammatory anti effect however effect tangeretin human thyroid investigate effect tangeretin cell proliferation apoptosis thyroid cell line snu investigate prove result,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Investigating the demographic characteristics and pathological manifestations of thyroid Cancer during the last two decades (1997–2017) in patients referred to Baqiyatallah hospital, Tehran, Iran Thyroid cancer is among the most common endocrine cancers, and its incidence in our country is in progress over the past decades. This aggravates the necessity to evaluate the changes in thyroid cancer. Through accessing the information of the records of all patients with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer between 1996 and 2017, the present study was conducted at Baqiyatallah Hospital (Tehran, Iran) according to scientific criteria. After the diagnosis, most of them also underwent surgery and were evaluated in terms of the rate of the involvement and the type of thyroid cancer, and the pathology report was recorded in their records. Information about the intended patients such as age, gender, pathologic type of cancer, associated with the patient (except thyroid cancer), and history of radiation to the patient were recorded in a standard form and subjected to statistical analysis. Demographic changes and pathological manifestations of cancers in the two decades (1997–2007) and (2007–2017) were compared. But comparisons have been made over five years. The incidence of thyroid cancer, especially papillary thyroid cancer type, was increasing at an early age, and the incidence of tumor size measuring 2–4 cm was rising. But the incidence of tumor sizes less than one centimeter declined. The amount of vascular and capsule involvement was about 3 times, and lymph node involvement was nearly 2 times. The increasing incidence of 2–4 cm tumor size in the age group of 20–50 years was more than other age groups. The incidence of thyroid cancer was increasing at an early age, and the enhancement of papillary thyroid type was higher than other types. As well as, in this study, it was found that the incidence of 2–4 cm tumor sizes was rising.","investigating the demographic characteristics and pathological manifestations of thyroid cancer during the last two decades (1997–2017) in patients referred to baqiyatallah hospital, tehran, iran thyroid cancer is among the most common endocrine cancers, and its incidence in our country is in progress over the past decades. this aggravates the necessity to evaluate the changes in thyroid cancer. through accessing the information of the records of all patients with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer between 1996 and 2017, the present study was conducted at baqiyatallah hospital (tehran, iran) according to scientific criteria. after the diagnosis, most of them also underwent surgery and were evaluated in terms of the rate of the involvement and the type of thyroid cancer, and the pathology report was recorded in their records. information about the intended patients such as age, gender, pathologic type of cancer, associated with the patient (except thyroid cancer), and history of radiation",investigate demographic characteristic pathological manifestation thyroid last two decade refer baqiyatallah hospital tehran iran thyroid among common endocrine incidence country progress past decade aggravate necessity evaluate change thyroid access information record diagnosis thyroid present conduct baqiyatallah hospital tehran iran accord scientific criterion diagnosis also underwent surgery evaluate term rate involvement type thyroid pathology report record record information intended age gender pathologic type associate except thyroid history radiation,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with newly evaluated papillary thyroid cancer Background: This study investigates whether diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of papillary thyroid cancer, using an age-, gender-, and race-matched analysis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 1559 patients with newly evaluated thyroid cancer over a 4-year period at our institution and identified 1313 patients (84%) with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Characteristics of patients with diabetes versus those without diabetes were compared with a chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for numeric variables. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma at our institution was compared (using an age-, gender-, and race-matched analysis) with that expected based on data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the same time period. Results: For patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the median age was 47 years; 74% were female; 83% were white; and the prevalence of diabetes was 8%. Among those with diabetes, 92% had type 2 diabetes, and 24% were treated with insulin. Risk factors for diabetes included age and race. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma of all ages versus that among patients from NHANES of all ages was not significantly different (RR 1.07, CI 0.88 - 1.28). The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid cancer who were 44 years of age or younger versus that among patients from NHANES who were 44 years of age or younger, however, was significantly increased (RR 2.32, CI 1.37 - 3.66). There was no significant difference when subgroup analysis was performed by gender or race.

"Incidence of Persistence and Recurrence of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Post-surgical Cases From a Tertiary Care Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Background Despite the excellent prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, recurrence remains a major concern. However, the persistence of thyroid cancer post-thyroidectomy is not uncommon. We aimed to characterise patients who underwent re-operative surgery for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and analyse the percentage of re-operations that truly were for ""recurrent"" disease versus the management of persistent disease. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of the hospital database, analysing patients who visited the nuclear medicine department at Mediclinic City Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, between 2015 and 2022. The study included patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent re-operations after total thyroidectomy. Recurrence was defined as the development of disease after a patient had undetectable thyroglobulin and negative radiological scans within one year of the first surgery. Cases were categorised as ""recurrent"", ""persistent"", or ""unable to classify"" in the event of missing data. Results Out of 836 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who visited the nuclear medicine department, 71 underwent re-operations. The mean age of these patients was 44.4 years (CI 41.7-47.0), of whom 78.9% were females. Almost half (46.5%) underwent re-operations within the first year, and 98.6% were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma. We were able to classify 63.4% of cases (n=45) as persistent disease, while 24 cases were categorised as ""unable to classify"". Only two cases met the criteria for recurrent disease. Conclusion The majority of cases previously classified as ""recurrent"" in differentiated thyroid carcinoma were found to be a persistent disease, possibly indicating inadequate therapy. Further research may be required to explore the reasons behind this eye-opening rate of disease persistence. This highlights an area for improvement in the management and future outcomes of differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients.","incidence of persistence and recurrence of differentiated thyroid cancer in post-surgical cases from a tertiary care hospital in dubai, united arab emirates. background despite the excellent prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, recurrence remains a major concern. however, the persistence of thyroid cancer post-thyroidectomy is not uncommon. we aimed to characterise patients who underwent re-operative surgery for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and analyse the percentage of re-operations that truly were for ""recurrent"" disease versus the management of persistent disease. methods we conducted a retrospective review of the hospital database, analysing patients who visited the nuclear medicine department at mediclinic city hospital, a tertiary care hospital in dubai, united arab emirates, between 2015 and 2022. the study included patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent re-operations after total thyroidectomy. recurrence was defined as the development of disease after a patient had undetectable thyroglobulin and negative radiological scans within one year of the first",incidence persistence recurrence differentiated thyroid post surgical tertiary care hospital dubai united arab emirates despite excellent prognosis differentiated thyroid carcinoma recurrence remain major concern however persistence thyroid post thyroidectomy uncommon characterise undergo operative surgery differentiate thyroid carcinoma analyse percentage operation truly recurrent versus management persistent method conduct retrospective review hospital database analyse visit nuclear medicine department mediclinic city hospital tertiary care hospital dubai united arab emirate include differentiated thyroid carcinoma underwent operation total thyroidectomy recurrence define development undetectable thyroglobulin negative radiological scan within one year first,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Thyroid cancer complicating familial adenomatous polyposis: mutation spectrum of at-risk individuals Lifetime risk of thyroid cancer associated with FAP has been reported as 1-2%. The mean age at diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma in FAP has been reported at 28 years. The aims of this paper are to better understand gene mutations associated with thyroid cancer and refine surveillance recommendations for patients with FAP. We performed a search in Pubmed, Ovid Medline and Embase with the terms (""Thyroid Gland""[Mesh] OR ""Thyroid Neoplasms""[Mesh]) AND ""Adenomatous Polyposis Coli""[Meshdenomatous Polyposis Coli""[Mesh] to identify subjects with thyroid cancer and FAP. As a reference group for APC mutations in the unselected FAP population, we used the UMD-APC database referenced in the Orphanet portal, which includes APC mutation data on 2040 individuals with FAP. There were 115 reported cases of thyroid cancer in patients with FAP (95 female: 11 male) with an average age of 29.2 years. Gene mutation testing results were reported in 48 patients. On comparing the prevalence of APC mutation in the population of FAP patients with thyroid cancer and the prevalence of the same mutation in the reference population an increased odds ratio was evident in individuals harboring an APC mutation at codon 1061 (OR: CI 4.1: 1.7-8.9). Analysis of the prevalence of thyroid cancer in individuals with FAP segregated by the region of the gene affected shows an increased risk of thyroid cancer in individuals harboring mutations proximal to codon 512 (OR 2.6, p 0.0099). There is increased risk for thyroid cancer in individuals with APC mutations at the 5' end (proximal to codon 528) along with the established high risk group harboring mutation at codon 1061.

"Screening for thyroid cancer in survivors of childhood and young adult cancer treated with neck radiation. The optimal method of screening for thyroid cancer in survivors of childhood and young adult cancer exposed to neck radiation remains controversial. Outcome data for a physical exam-based screening approach are lacking. We conducted a retrospective review of adult survivors of childhood and young adult cancer with a history of neck radiation followed in the Adult Long-Term Follow-Up Clinic at Memorial Sloan Kettering between November 2005 and August 2014. Eligible patients underwent a physical exam of the thyroid and were followed for at least 1 year afterwards. Ineligible patients were those with prior diagnosis of benign or malignant thyroid nodules. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range 0–9.4 years), 106 ultrasounds and 2277 physical exams were performed among 585 patients. Forty survivors had an abnormal thyroid physical exam median of 21 years from radiotherapy; 50% of those with an abnormal exam were survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, 60% had radiation at ages 10–19, and 53% were female. Ultimately, 24 underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA). Surgery revealed papillary carcinoma in seven survivors; six are currently free of disease and one with active disease is undergoing watchful waiting. Among those with one or more annual visits, representing 1732 person-years of follow-up, no cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed within a year of normal physical exam. These findings support the application of annual physical exam without routine ultrasound for thyroid cancer screening among survivors with a history of neck radiation. Survivors with a history of neck radiation may not require routine thyroid ultrasound for thyroid cancer screening. Among adult survivors of childhood and young adult cancer with a history of radiation therapy to the neck, annual physical exam is an acceptable thyroid cancer screening strategy.","screening for thyroid cancer in survivors of childhood and young adult cancer treated with neck radiation. the optimal method of screening for thyroid cancer in survivors of childhood and young adult cancer exposed to neck radiation remains controversial. outcome data for a physical exam-based screening approach are lacking. we conducted a retrospective review of adult survivors of childhood and young adult cancer with a history of neck radiation followed in the adult long-term follow-up clinic at memorial sloan kettering between november 2005 and august 2014. eligible patients underwent a physical exam of the thyroid and were followed for at least 1 year afterwards. ineligible patients were those with prior diagnosis of benign or malignant thyroid nodules. during a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range 0–9.4 years), 106 ultrasounds and 2277 physical exams were performed among 585 patients. forty survivors had an abnormal thyroid physical exam median of 21 years from",screen thyroid survivor childhood young adult treat neck radiation optimal method screen thyroid survivor childhood young adult expose neck radiation remain controversial outcome data physical exam base screening approach lack conduct retrospective review adult survivor childhood young adult history neck radiation follow adult long term follow clinic memorial sloan kettering november august eligible undergo physical exam thyroid follow least year afterwards ineligible prior diagnosis benign malignant thyroid nodule median follow year range year ultrasound physical exam perform among forty survivor abnormal thyroid physical exam median year,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid cancer risk in Belarus after the Chernobyl accident: comparison with external exposures. Within the time period 1990–1993, childhood thyroid cancer incidence due to the Chernobyl accident increased dramatically in Belarus, especially with regard to the birth cohort January 1, 1971, to May 31, 1986. This rise subsequently slowed down, i.e. during the period 1994–1996. The respective data were analysed and compared with the results of an analysis on the time dependence of thyroid cancer incidence in a pooled cohort of persons who had been exposed during childhood to external radiation with high dose rates. Concerning the period of 5–10 years following exposure, the excess absolute cancer risk per unit thyroid dose in the latter (external) exposure group was found to exceed the one in the Belarus group by a factor of two. This difference, however, is not statistically significant. The age-adjusted average excess absolute risk per unit thyroid dose for the period of 5–50 years following external childhood exposure was found to be 8 female and 14 male cases per 104 person-year · Gy, which is a factor about 2.5 times higher than for the non-adjusted risk in the pooled cohort, as reported by Ron et al. in 1995. Assessments of future excess thyroid cancer cases due to the Chernobyl accident were done on the basis of the time dependence of thyroid cancer risk following external exposure. The thyroid cancer incidence among the birth cohort considered in Belarus and for a period starting from the cessation of the available observation data (1 January 1997) and extending to 50 years after the Chernobyl accident has been estimated to be about 15,000 cases, with an uncertainty range of 5000–45,000 cases. According to our calculations, 80% of these cases exceed the baseline risk under enhanced thyroid surveillance.","thyroid cancer risk in belarus after the chernobyl accident: comparison with external exposures. within the time period 1990–1993, childhood thyroid cancer incidence due to the chernobyl accident increased dramatically in belarus, especially with regard to the birth cohort january 1, 1971, to may 31, 1986. this rise subsequently slowed down, i.e. during the period 1994–1996. the respective data were analysed and compared with the results of an analysis on the time dependence of thyroid cancer incidence in a pooled cohort of persons who had been exposed during childhood to external radiation with high dose rates. concerning the period of 5–10 years following exposure, the excess absolute cancer risk per unit thyroid dose in the latter (external) exposure group was found to exceed the one in the belarus group by a factor of two. this difference, however, is not statistically significant. the age-adjusted average excess absolute risk per unit thyroid dose",thyroid risk belarus chernobyl accident comparison external exposure within time period childhood thyroid incidence due chernobyl accident increase dramatically belarus especially regard birth cohort january may rise subsequently slow e period respective data analyse compare result time dependence thyroid incidence pooled cohort person expose childhood external radiation high dose rate concern period year follow exposure excess absolute risk per unit thyroid dose latter external exposure group find exceed one belarus group factor two difference however statistically significant age adjust average excess absolute risk per unit thyroid dose,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy for advanced thyroid cancers Thyroid cancer is a frequently encountered endocrine malignancy. Despite the favorable prognosis of this disease, 15–20% of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) cases and most anaplastic types, remain resistant to standard treatment options, including radioactive iodine (RAI). In addition, around 30% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases show resistance after surgery. The evolving understanding of disease-specific molecular therapeutic targets has led to the approval of two targeted therapies (Sorafenib and Lenvatinib) for RAI refractory DTC and another two drugs (Vandetanib and Cabozantinib) for MTC. These advanced therapies exert their effects by blocking the MAPK pathway, which has been widely correlated to different types of thyroid cancers. While these drugs remain reserved for thyroid cancer patients who failed all treatment options, their ability to improve patients’ overall survival remain hindered by their low efficacy and other molecular factors. Among these factors is the tumor’s ability to activate parallel proliferative signaling pathways other than the cascades blocked by these drugs, along with overexpression of some tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR). These facts urge the search for novel different treatment strategies for advanced thyroid cases beyond these drugs. Furthermore, the growing knowledge of the dynamic immune system interaction with tumor microenvironment has revolutionized the cancer immune therapy field. In this review, we aim to discuss the molecular escape mechanisms of thyroid tumors from these drugs. We also highlight novel therapeutic options targeting other pathways than MAPK, including PI3K pathway, ALK translocations and HER2/3 receptors and their clinical impact. We also aim to discuss the usage of targeted therapy in restoring thyroid tumor sensitivity to RAI, and finally turn to extensively discuss the role of immunotherapy as a potential alternative treatment option for advanced thyroid diseases.","novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy for advanced thyroid cancers thyroid cancer is a frequently encountered endocrine malignancy. despite the favorable prognosis of this disease, 15–20% of differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc) cases and most anaplastic types, remain resistant to standard treatment options, including radioactive iodine (rai). in addition, around 30% of medullary thyroid cancer (mtc) cases show resistance after surgery. the evolving understanding of disease-specific molecular therapeutic targets has led to the approval of two targeted therapies (sorafenib and lenvatinib) for rai refractory dtc and another two drugs (vandetanib and cabozantinib) for mtc. these advanced therapies exert their effects by blocking the mapk pathway, which has been widely correlated to different types of thyroid cancers. while these drugs remain reserved for thyroid cancer patients who failed all treatment options, their ability to improve patients’ overall survival remain hindered by their low efficacy and other molecular factors. among these factors is the",novel target therapy immunotherapy advanced thyroid thyroid frequently encounter endocrine malignancy despite favorable prognosis differentiated thyroid dtc anaplastic type remain resistant standard option include radioactive iodine rai addition around medullary thyroid mtc show resistance surgery evolve understanding specific molecular therapeutic target lead approval two targeted therapy sorafenib lenvatinib rai refractory dtc another two drug vandetanib cabozantinib mtc advanced therapy exert effect block mapk pathway widely correlate different type thyroid drug remain reserve thyroid fail option ability improve overall survival remain hinder low efficacy molecular factor among factor,e,Thyroid Cancer
"The functions and prognostic values of m6A RNA methylation regulators in thyroid carcinoma. Background N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common RNA modification and regulates RNA splicing, translation, translocation, and stability. Aberrant expression of m6A has been reported in various types of human cancers. m6A RNA modification is dynamically and reversibly mediated by different regulators, including methyltransferase, demethylases, and m6A binding proteins. However, the role of m6A RNA methylation regulators in thyroid cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the 13 main m6A RNA modification regulators in thyroid carcinoma. Methods We obtained clinical data and RNA sequencing data of 13 m6A RNA methylation regulators from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) THCA database. We performed consensus clustering to identify the clinical relevance of m6A RNA methylation regulators in thyroid carcinoma. Then we used LASSO Cox regression analysis to generate a prognostic signature based on m6A RNA modification regulator expression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses were performed to explore differential cellular processes and signaling pathways between the two groups based on risk signature. Results We found that most of the m6A RNA modification regulators are down-regulated in 450 patients with thyroid carcinoma. We derived a three m6A RNA modification regulator genes-based risk signature (FTO, RBM15 and KIAA1429), that is an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, we found that this risk signature could better predict outcome in male than female. Functional research in vitro demonstrated that the m6A RNA methylation regulators involved in the model acted significant role in the proliferation and migration of thyroid cancer cells. Conclusions Our study revealed the influence of m6A RNA methylation regulators on thyroid carcinoma through biological experiments and three-gene prognostic model.","the functions and prognostic values of m6a rna methylation regulators in thyroid carcinoma. background n6-methyladenosine (m6a) is the most common rna modification and regulates rna splicing, translation, translocation, and stability. aberrant expression of m6a has been reported in various types of human cancers. m6a rna modification is dynamically and reversibly mediated by different regulators, including methyltransferase, demethylases, and m6a binding proteins. however, the role of m6a rna methylation regulators in thyroid cancer remains unknown. the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the 13 main m6a rna modification regulators in thyroid carcinoma. methods we obtained clinical data and rna sequencing data of 13 m6a rna methylation regulators from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) thca database. we performed consensus clustering to identify the clinical relevance of m6a rna methylation regulators in thyroid carcinoma. then we used lasso cox regression analysis to generate a prognostic signature based on m6a",function prognostic value rna methylation regulator thyroid carcinoma n methyladenosine common rna modification regulate rna splice translation translocation stability aberrant expression report various type human rna modification dynamically reversibly mediate different regulator include methyltransferase demethylases binding proteins however role rna methylation regulator thyroid remain unknown investigate effect main rna modification regulator thyroid carcinoma method obtain data rna sequence data rna methylation regulator genome atlas tcga thca database perform consensus cluster identify relevance rna methylation regulator thyroid carcinoma use lasso cox regression generate prognostic signature base,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Consequences of atmospheric contamination by radioiodine: the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents. After the accidents of nuclear power plants at Chernobyl and at Fukushima, huge amounts of radioactive iodine were released into the atmosphere. We reviewed data on the health consequences of these accidents with a focus on thyroid consequences. Among the 2 million children who were living in highly contaminated regions in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, 7000 cases of thyroid cancer had occurred in 2005. This is the most significant radiation-induced consequence of the Chernobyl accident. The increased incidence of thyroid cancer observed in adult population who lived in these highly contaminated regions is at least in major part related to screening and it is not possible to individualize among these thyroid cancers those that are potentially caused by radiation exposure. For populations who lived outside these regions at the time of the accident, there is no detectable consequence of the radiation exposure on the thyroid gland. Among children who lived nearby the Fukushima power plant in 2011, there is currently no evidence of an increased incidence of thyroid cancer. Ultrasonography screening in these individuals detected a number of thyroid cancers that are probably not related to the accident. Because thyroid cancer is frequent, studies have been carried out to distinguish radiation-induced from their sporadic counterparts, and genomic signatures might be helpful. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident clearly demonstrate that populations living nearby a nuclear power plant should be protected in case of accident by sheltering, food restrictions and prophylaxis of thyroid irradiation by potassium iodine administration, if the predicted estimated dose to the thyroid gland of children might be >50 mGy. These countermeasures should be applied in priority to children, adolescents and pregnant women; they are safe and effective.","consequences of atmospheric contamination by radioiodine: the chernobyl and fukushima accidents. after the accidents of nuclear power plants at chernobyl and at fukushima, huge amounts of radioactive iodine were released into the atmosphere. we reviewed data on the health consequences of these accidents with a focus on thyroid consequences. among the 2 million children who were living in highly contaminated regions in belarus, ukraine and russia, 7000 cases of thyroid cancer had occurred in 2005. this is the most significant radiation-induced consequence of the chernobyl accident. the increased incidence of thyroid cancer observed in adult population who lived in these highly contaminated regions is at least in major part related to screening and it is not possible to individualize among these thyroid cancers those that are potentially caused by radiation exposure. for populations who lived outside these regions at the time of the accident, there is no detectable consequence of",consequence atmospheric contamination radioiodine chernobyl fukushima accident accident nuclear power plant chernobyl fukushima huge amount radioactive iodine release atmosphere review data health consequence accident focus thyroid consequence among million child live highly contaminate region belarus ukraine russia thyroid occur significant radiation induce consequence chernobyl accident increase incidence thyroid observe adult population live highly contaminated region least major part relate screen possible individualize among thyroid potentially cause radiation exposure population live outside region time accident detectable consequence,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid Cancer in Ecuador, a 16 years population-based analysis (2001-2016). Thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine neoplasia worldwide. Information from Andean countries is scarce.

This is a cross-sectional population-based analysis of thyroid cancer epidemiology in Ecuador from 2001 to 2016. The variables studied were the overall mortality rate, socio-demographics characteristics of the hospitalized patients, geographical trends and the burden of thyroid cancer in Ecuador. All the data was obtained from the official records reported by the Ministry of Public Health’s and retrieved from the public databases of the Vital Statistics Deaths and Births Databases and the National Institute of Census and Statistics (INEC). In Ecuador, over a period of 16 years from 2001 to 2016 a total of 23,632 hospital admissions were reported, which caused 1539 deaths due thyroid cancer. Data demonstrated an annual mean of 1477 cases, which caused 96 deaths per year in average. The annual incidence fluctuated from 3 in 2001 to 22 in 2016 per 100,000 inhabitants. Women were 5 times more likely than men to have thyroid cancer. The average length of stay for both sexes were 4 days. The mortality attributable to thyroid cancer represent less than 0.3% of all cancer deaths. Ecuador has one of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in Latin America, ranking first among women in Latin America. Although this cancer is frequent, mortality rate is relatively low.

"Reply to “Differences in the Impact of Age on Mortality in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer” To the editors: We read with great interest the recent publication by Yan et al. 1 highlighting the important prognostic differences between follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and the far more commonly encountered papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). FTC recurs rarely, but patients who have recurrences may die of metastatic disease in spite of otherwise favorable risk profiles. The different biology between the categories of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., PTC and FTC) is evident both clinically and in the laboratory. Furthermore, our group recently published a whole exome-sequencing analysis of FTC that mapped the genetic landscape of these tumors, with a particular emphasis on the infrequent widely invasive (WIFTC) subtype. 2 Of 10 WIFTC patients studied, 5 experienced recurrence and died of FTC within 10 years. Of 6 thyroid cancer-specific deaths in our overall FTC cohort of 39 cases, half were classified as stage I or II by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth-edition staging system, mostly due to the increased age cutoff of 55 years. 3 Interestingly, we found that both genomic markers and traditional clinical and histopathologic factors predicted poor survival. Unfortunately, the degree of FTC invasion is not wellcaptured in the national cancer registries, so a large-scale analysis of these high-risk subgroups is not possible using these approaches. Prior studies have demonstrated the prognostic significance of the degree of invasion for FTC in smaller single-institution series. 4 Although the AJCC eighth-edition staging system provides accurate prognostic information for the vast majority of patients with welldifferentiated thyroid cancer, certain high-risk histologic or molecular features may outweigh traditional tumor-nodemetastasis (TNM) staging and should be considered when the risk of recurrence and death is evaluated for thyroid cancer patients.","reply to “differences in the impact of age on mortality in well-differentiated thyroid cancer” to the editors: we read with great interest the recent publication by yan et al. 1 highlighting the important prognostic differences between follicular thyroid cancer (ftc) and the far more commonly encountered papillary thyroid cancer (ptc). ftc recurs rarely, but patients who have recurrences may die of metastatic disease in spite of otherwise favorable risk profiles. the different biology between the categories of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., ptc and ftc) is evident both clinically and in the laboratory. furthermore, our group recently published a whole exome-sequencing analysis of ftc that mapped the genetic landscape of these tumors, with a particular emphasis on the infrequent widely invasive (wiftc) subtype. 2 of 10 wiftc patients studied, 5 experienced recurrence and died of ftc within 10 years. of 6 thyroid cancer-specific deaths in our overall ftc cohort of 39",reply difference impact age mortality well differentiate thyroid editor read great interest recent publication yan et al highlight important prognostic difference follicular thyroid ftc far commonly encountered papillary thyroid ptc ftc recur rarely recurrence may die metastatic spite otherwise favorable risk profile different biology category well differentiate thyroid e ptc ftc evident clinically laboratory furthermore group recently publish whole exome sequence ftc map genetic landscape particular emphasis infrequent widely invasive wiftc subtype wiftc experienced recurrence die ftc within year thyroid specific death overall ftc cohort,e,Thyroid Cancer
"ID Proteins May Reduce Aggressiveness of Thyroid Tumors. ID genes have an important function in the cell cycle, and ID proteins may help identify aggressive tumors, besides being considered promising therapeutic targets. However, their role in thyroid tumors is still poorly understood. We examined ID expression and their correlation with diagnostic and prognostic features aiming to find a clinical application in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) cases. mRNA levels of ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4 genes were quantified and their expression was observed by immunohistochemistry in 194 thyroid samples including 68 goiters, 16 follicular adenomas, 75 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas, 18 follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 5 follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 1 anaplastic thyroid cancer, besides 11 normal thyroid tissues. DTC patients were managed according to standard protocols and followed up for M = 28 ± 16 months. ID2, ID3, and ID4 mRNA levels were higher in benign (2.0 ± 1.9; 0.6 ± 0.6; and 0.7 ± 1.0 AU, respectively) than those in malignant nodules (0.30 ± 0.62; 0.3 ± 0.3; and 0.2 ± 0.3 AU, respectively, p < 0.0001 for all three genes) and were associated with no extra thyroid invasion or metastasis at diagnosis. ID3 nuclear protein expression was higher in benign than that in malignant cells (5.2 ± 0.9 vs 3.0 ± 1.8 AU; p < 0.0001). On the contrary, the cytoplasmic expression of ID3 was higher in malignant than that in benign lesions (5.7 ± 1.5 vs 4.0 ± 1.4 AU; p < 0.0001). Our data indicate that ID genes are involved in thyroid tumorigenesis and suggest these genes act impeding the evolution of more aggressive phenotypes. The different patterns of their tissue expression may help identify malignancy and characterize thyroid lesion aggressiveness.","id proteins may reduce aggressiveness of thyroid tumors. id genes have an important function in the cell cycle, and id proteins may help identify aggressive tumors, besides being considered promising therapeutic targets. however, their role in thyroid tumors is still poorly understood. we examined id expression and their correlation with diagnostic and prognostic features aiming to find a clinical application in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) cases. mrna levels of id1, id2, id3, and id4 genes were quantified and their expression was observed by immunohistochemistry in 194 thyroid samples including 68 goiters, 16 follicular adenomas, 75 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas, 18 follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 5 follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 1 anaplastic thyroid cancer, besides 11 normal thyroid tissues. dtc patients were managed according to standard protocols and followed up for m = 28 ± 16 months. id2, id3, and id4 mrna levels were higher in benign (2.0 ±",id protein may reduce aggressiveness thyroid id gene important function cell cycle id protein may help identify aggressive besides consider promising therapeutic target however role thyroid still poorly understood examine id expression correlation diagnostic prognostic feature find application differentiated thyroid carcinoma dtc mrna level id id id id gene quantify expression observe immunohistochemistry thyroid sample include goiter follicular adenomas classic papillary thyroid carcinoma follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma follicular thyroid carcinoma anaplastic thyroid besides normal thyroid tissue dtc manage accord standard protocol follow month id id id mrna level high benign,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid Cancer Detection with Dual-isotope Parathyroid Scintigraphy in Primary Hyperparathyroidism Thyroid cancer cells have been shown to take up 99mTc-sestamibi. The role for 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy (Tc-MIBI) in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is unclear. Our aim was to determine whether dual-isotope parathyroid scintigraphy is useful in identifying thyroid cancer. A prospective database of 3,187 patients who underwent neck exploration for PHPT was reviewed to identify patients who had concurrent thyroid resection. Patients with benign and malignant thyroid disease were comparatively analyzed. A total of 470 patients underwent both thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy (reoperations in 21%). Benign disease (n = 391, 83%) was more common than malignancy [papillary thyroid cancer (n = 75) and medullary thyroid cancer (n = 5); 1 had both]. Dual-isotope scintigraphy obtained in 374 patients (80%) had a sensitivity of 67% and a positive predictive value of 66% for parathyroid adenoma localization in these patients with thyroid disease. False-positive scintigraphy occurred in 22% with benign and 45% with malignant thyroid disease (P = 0.002). On Tc-MIBI imaging, 54 (86%) of 63 patients with malignancy had hot nodules, compared to 248 (81%) of 308 patients with benign disease (P = 0.49). On I-123 imaging, 34 (54%) of 63 patients with malignancy had cold nodules, compared to 42 (14%) of 304 patients with benign disease (P < 0.001). A dual-isotype phenotype of both Tc-MIBI-Hot and I-123-Cold had sensitivity 52%, specificity 88%, positive predictive value 47%, and negative predictive value 90% for detecting a thyroid malignancy. A Tc-MIBI-Hot/I-123-Cold phenotype is very specific for detecting thyroid malignancy. Patients with this imaging phenotype should strongly be considered for preoperative ultrasound-guided biopsy. Patients found intraoperatively to have false-positive parathyroid scintigraphy should be evaluated for thyroid cancer.","thyroid cancer detection with dual-isotope parathyroid scintigraphy in primary hyperparathyroidism thyroid cancer cells have been shown to take up 99mtc-sestamibi. the role for 99mtc-sestamibi scintigraphy (tc-mibi) in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (phpt) is unclear. our aim was to determine whether dual-isotope parathyroid scintigraphy is useful in identifying thyroid cancer. a prospective database of 3,187 patients who underwent neck exploration for phpt was reviewed to identify patients who had concurrent thyroid resection. patients with benign and malignant thyroid disease were comparatively analyzed. a total of 470 patients underwent both thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy (reoperations in 21%). benign disease (n = 391, 83%) was more common than malignancy [papillary thyroid cancer (n = 75) and medullary thyroid cancer (n = 5); 1 had both]. dual-isotope scintigraphy obtained in 374 patients (80%) had a sensitivity of 67% and a positive predictive value of 66% for parathyroid adenoma localization",thyroid detection dual isotope parathyroid scintigraphy primary hyperparathyroidism thyroid cell show take mtc sestamibi role mtc sestamibi scintigraphy tc mibi diagnosis thyroid primary hyperparathyroidism phpt unclear determine whether dual isotope parathyroid scintigraphy useful identify thyroid prospective database undergo neck exploration phpt review identify concurrent thyroid resection benign malignant thyroid comparatively analyze total underwent thyroidectomy parathyroidectomy reoperations benign n common malignancy papillary thyroid n medullary thyroid n dual isotope scintigraphy obtain sensitivity positive predictive value parathyroid adenoma localization,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Postoperative rehabilitation and quality of life evaluation for transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach. There are no targeted rehabilitation training modalities and assessment tools for patients after transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA). Herein, we develop a new assessment questionnaire and rehabilitation training modality and evaluate its safety and effectiveness. The THYCA-QoL-TOETVA questionnaire was compiled, and reliability and validity analyses were performed. Patients were divided into the new rehabilitation training group (N) or the conventional rehabilitation training group (C), and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed after administering questionnaires to patients in both groups. Cervical range of motion (CROM) data were also measured and collected for statistical analysis. The questionnaire used in this study showed good expert authority, coordination, internal consistency, and questionnaire reliability. A total of 476 patients were included after PSM, and the questionnaire results showed that recovery and quality of life were better in the N group than in the C group (124.55 ± 8.171 vs. 122.94 ± 8.366, p = 0.026).

"Decrease of prostaglandin I2 binding sites in thyroid cancer. The properties of specific prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin, PGI2) binding sites in normal thyroid tissue have been characterised. Tissue samples obtained intraoperatively from patients with 'cold' solitary thyroid nodules (as preoperatively selected by thyroid gland scintigraphy, thyroid gland ultrasonography and Papanicolaou cytology following fine needle aspiration of the nodule area) have been used for thyroid membrane preparation. Employing [3H]iloprost, a chemically stable PGI2-analogue as a radioligand, saturation experiments for comparative binding studies have been attempted. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for normal thyroid parenchyma distant to the nodule area revealed heterogeneity of the [3H]iloprost sites exhibiting a high-affinity binding capacity (Bmax) of 613.2 +/- 130.4 fmol mg-1 membrane protein and a low-affinity binding capacity of 5.1 +/- 1.6 pmol mg-1 membrane protein. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) amounted to 18.9 +/- 8.9 nM and to 131.5 +/- 39.2 nM, respectively.

"Correlation of BRAF mutation and SUV max levels in thyroid cancer patients incidentally detected in 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography The prognostic importance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in primary thyroid tumor and molecular basis responsible for its mechanism has not yet been well characterized. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the correlation between the maximum standardized uptake levels and B-type Raf kinase mutation positivity in incidentally detected papillary thyroid cancer patients during 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography examination. We retrospectively evaluated 6873 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography scans of consecutive subjects from a database search for tumor staging in 2014 at our hospital Nuclear Medicine Center. In total, 135 patients had focal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the thyroid. Of these, 76 patients had fine-needle aspiration biopsy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–maximum standardized uptake of the positron emission tomography-detected nodules was recorded. B-type Raf kinase (V600E) mutation and p53 protein expression were evaluated in papillary thyroid cancer patients. The incidence of thyroid incidentaloma in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–maximum standardized uptake scans was 2 % (135/6873). Of the 76 patients evaluated, 41 % (n = 31) were diagnosed papillary thyroid cancer. B-type Raf kinase mutation was positive in 51 % (17/30) of the papillary thyroid cancer patients.

The clinicopathological characteristics and mutations of thyroid cancers were analyzed. 63 patients (mean age: 51.0 years, range: 21–81 years; female 75%, male 25%) were identified. 53 patients had papillary (12 follicular variant), 4 patients follicular (1 oxyphilic variant), 3 patients medullary, and 3 patients anaplastic thyroid cancer. T1 tumors were found in 34 patients (pT1a, 20 patients; pT1b, 14 patients), T2 tumors in 10 patients, T3 tumors in 16 patients, and T4 tumors in 3 patients. Lymph node involvement was seen in 15 patients and metastatic disease in 1 patient. Mutations of BRAF (B-type Raf kinase) were detected in 23 and mutation of NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog) in 2 papillary thyroid cancers. No concomitant mutations of BRAF and NRAS were found. Females accounted for 75% of the patients with newly diagnosed thyroid cancer and the incidence peaked at a younger age than in males.

"Thyroid cancer: incidence and mortality trends in China, 2005–2015 Understanding secular trends of thyroid cancer is critical to plan strategies for cancer prevention and control. Our aim was to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer in China during 2005–2015. A retrospective cohort evaluation of thyroid cancer cases and deaths during 2005–2015 was performed using population-based data from the Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report. The incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were stratified by gender, age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14…80–84, 85–), and area (urban or rural). A Joinpoint regression model was used to examine secular trends. In China, the age-standardized incidence was 3.21/105 in 2005, and increased to 9.61/105 in 2015. Besides, a significant increase incidence rate was observed with the average annual percent change (AAPC) of 12.4% (95% CI: 10.5%–14.4%) in the period 2005–2015. The age-standardized mortality was 0.30/105 in 2005 and 0.35/105 in 2015, and the AAPC was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3%–4.5%). For both incidence and mortality, the rates of thyroid cancer were much higher in females than in males, and in urban areas rather than rural areas; however, the rates of increasing trends showed no significant differences. With respect to the highest age-specific rates, it appeared in the age group of 50–54 years old for incidence and in the age group of 80–84 years old for mortality. Notably, the rate of increasing incidence trend was lower in older age groups, especially for people aged 70–79 years old. A rapid increase in incidence and a moderate increase in mortality of thyroid cancer were observed from 2005 to 2015 in our study. Effective measures and tailored programs should be taken to curb the growth trend and reduce the disease burden.","thyroid cancer: incidence and mortality trends in china, 2005–2015 understanding secular trends of thyroid cancer is critical to plan strategies for cancer prevention and control. our aim was to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer in china during 2005–2015. a retrospective cohort evaluation of thyroid cancer cases and deaths during 2005–2015 was performed using population-based data from the chinese cancer registry annual report. the incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were stratified by gender, age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14…80–84, 85–), and area (urban or rural). a joinpoint regression model was used to examine secular trends. in china, the age-standardized incidence was 3.21/105 in 2005, and increased to 9.61/105 in 2015. besides, a significant increase incidence rate was observed with the average annual percent change (aapc) of 12.4% (95% ci: 10.5%–14.4%) in the period 2005–2015. the age-standardized mortality was 0.30/105 in 2005 and 0.35/105 in 2015,",thyroid incidence mortality trend china understanding secular trend thyroid critical plan strategy prevention control estimate incidence mortality trend thyroid china retrospective cohort evaluation thyroid death perform use population base data chinese registry annual report incidence mortality rate thyroid stratify gender age group area urban rural joinpoint regression model use examine secular trend china age standardize incidence increase besides significant increase incidence rate observe average annual percent change aapc ci period age standardize mortality,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Outcome of thyroid ultrasound screening in FAP patients with a normal baseline exam Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary cancer syndrome associated with a substantial lifetime risk for colorectal cancer. The leading extra-colonic causes of cancer in FAP include duodenal and thyroid cancer (TC). Recent guidelines recommend annual thyroid ultrasound (TUS) screening beginning in the teenage years but the evidence to support the interval particularly in FAP patients with a normal baseline ultrasound is lacking. TUS results from FAP patients enrolled in a thyroid screening program from 2006 to 2016 and who had at least 2 TUS were reviewed. TUS findings were classified as normal, low (LR) or high risk (HR) for TC based on nodule characteristics as determined by American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. We assessed the incidence of TC in patient with normal baseline TUS and factors associated with TC. 264 FAP patients were included. Baseline TUS was normal in 167, LR in 74, and HR in 24 patients. Patients were observed for a mean 4.8 years and underwent an average of 3 TUS. Patients with normal baseline TUS did not develop TC during the course of follow up of 5.1 years. TC developed in 6 patients (2.3%) all with baseline nodules; 5 in the LR group and 1 in the HR group. Factors associated with development of TC were presence of baseline nodule(s) and female sex. The development of TC in FAP patients in a TUS screening program with short term follow up is low and no FAP patient with a normal baseline TUS developed TC during observation. Annual TUS in patients with a normal baseline TUS may not be needed. Extending the screening interval to 2 years may be reasonable until nodules are detected.","outcome of thyroid ultrasound screening in fap patients with a normal baseline exam familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) is a hereditary cancer syndrome associated with a substantial lifetime risk for colorectal cancer. the leading extra-colonic causes of cancer in fap include duodenal and thyroid cancer (tc). recent guidelines recommend annual thyroid ultrasound (tus) screening beginning in the teenage years but the evidence to support the interval particularly in fap patients with a normal baseline ultrasound is lacking. tus results from fap patients enrolled in a thyroid screening program from 2006 to 2016 and who had at least 2 tus were reviewed. tus findings were classified as normal, low (lr) or high risk (hr) for tc based on nodule characteristics as determined by american thyroid association (ata) guidelines. we assessed the incidence of tc in patient with normal baseline tus and factors associated with tc. 264 fap patients were included. baseline tus",outcome thyroid ultrasound screening fap normal baseline exam familial adenomatous polyposis fap hereditary syndrome associate substantial lifetime risk colorectal lead extra colonic cause fap include duodenal thyroid tc recent guideline recommend annual thyroid ultrasound tus screen begin teenage year evidence support interval particularly fap normal baseline ultrasound lack tus result fap enrol thyroid screen program least tus review tus finding classify normal low lr high risk hr tc base nodule characteristic determine american thyroid association ata guideline assess incidence tc normal baseline tus factor associate tc fap include baseline tus,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Regulatory role of Chitinase 3-like 1 gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma proved by integration analyses of single-cell sequencing with cohort and experimental validations. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common thyroid carcinomas. The gross extrathyroidal extension and extensive metastases of PTC lead to high rates of recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying PTC development are poorly understood. In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, the transcriptome profiles of two PTC patients were addressed, including PTC1 with low malignancy and good prognosis and PTC2 with high malignancy and poor prognosis. We found that epithelial subcluster Epi02 was the most associated with the malignant development of PTC cells, with which the fold change of Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is on the top of the differentially expressed genes between PTC1 and PTC2 (P < 0.001). However CHI3L1 is rarely investigated in PTC as far. We then studied its role in PTC with a series of experiments. Firstly, qRT-PCR analysis of 14 PTC patients showed that the expression of CHI3L1 was positively correlated with malignancy. In addition, overexpression or silencing of CHI3L1 in TPC-1 cells, a PTC cell line, cultured in vitro showed that the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of the cells were promoted or alleviated by CHI3L1. Further, immunohistochemistry analysis of 110 PTC cases revealed a significant relationship between CHI3L1 protein expression and PTC progression, especially the T (P < 0.001), N (P < 0.001), M stages (P = 0.007) and gross ETE (P < 0.001). Together, our results prove that CHI3L1 is a positive regulator of malignant development of PTC, and it promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of PTC cells. Our study improves understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of PTC and provides new insights for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PTC.","regulatory role of chitinase 3-like 1 gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma proved by integration analyses of single-cell sequencing with cohort and experimental validations. papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc) is one of the most common thyroid carcinomas. the gross extrathyroidal extension and extensive metastases of ptc lead to high rates of recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. however, the mechanisms underlying ptc development are poorly understood. in this study, using single-cell rna sequencing, the transcriptome profiles of two ptc patients were addressed, including ptc1 with low malignancy and good prognosis and ptc2 with high malignancy and poor prognosis. we found that epithelial subcluster epi02 was the most associated with the malignant development of ptc cells, with which the fold change of chitinase 3-like 1 (chi3l1) is on the top of the differentially expressed genes between ptc1 and ptc2 (p < 0.001). however chi3l1 is rarely investigated in ptc as far. we then studied",regulatory role chitinase like gene papillary thyroid carcinoma prove integration single cell sequence cohort experimental validation papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc one common thyroid carcinomas gross extrathyroidal extension extensive metastasis ptc lead high rate recurrence poor outcome however mechanism underlie ptc development poorly understand use single cell rna sequence transcriptome profile two ptc addressed include ptc low malignancy good prognosis ptc high malignancy poor prognosis find epithelial subcluster epi associated malignant development ptc cell fold change chitinase like chi l top differentially express gene ptc ptc p however chi l rarely investigate ptc far,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Meeting report: the 5th International expert symposium in Fukushima on radiation and health. The symposium entitled “Chernobyl +30, Fukushima +5: Lessons and Solutions for Fukushima’s Thyroid Question” was held in September, 2016 in Fukushima. The aim of the Symposium was to revisit and recapitulate evidence from the studies in Chernobyl in order to share multidisciplinary opinions and views on the likely reason for the high rate of thyroid cancer detected by the Thyroid Ultrasound Examination program in Fukushima Prefecture. The high prevalence of thyroid cancer in young individuals causes concerns among Fukushima residents and the general public that it might be due to putative radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Twenty-six experts from Japan and abroad, including participants affiliated with international organizations, reviewed the results of radiation epidemiology investigations in Chernobyl, presented clinical experience of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with radiation-related thyroid cancer, and scrutinized the findings on thyroid cancer in Fukushima. Conclusions drawn at the symposium included understanding that in contrast to Chernobyl, doses to the public from the accident in Fukushima were too low to give rise to a discernible excess risk for thyroid cancer. The high detection rate of thyroid cancer and benign abnormalities resulted from the use of highly sensitive ultrasound equipment and sophisticated protocol of examination used in the Thyroid Ultrasound Examination, and therefore not attributable to radiation. Coordinated efforts will be necessary to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which may carry its own health disbenefits. Clear communication to the screening participants and their families is recommended in regard to why the examination is being conducted and to explain the likely outcomes and risks, including the means and options for treatment if a thyroid disorder is detected.","meeting report: the 5th international expert symposium in fukushima on radiation and health. the symposium entitled “chernobyl +30, fukushima +5: lessons and solutions for fukushima’s thyroid question” was held in september, 2016 in fukushima. the aim of the symposium was to revisit and recapitulate evidence from the studies in chernobyl in order to share multidisciplinary opinions and views on the likely reason for the high rate of thyroid cancer detected by the thyroid ultrasound examination program in fukushima prefecture. the high prevalence of thyroid cancer in young individuals causes concerns among fukushima residents and the general public that it might be due to putative radiation exposure from the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident. twenty-six experts from japan and abroad, including participants affiliated with international organizations, reviewed the results of radiation epidemiology investigations in chernobyl, presented clinical experience of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with radiation-related thyroid cancer, and",meet report th international expert symposium fukushima radiation health symposium entitle chernobyl fukushima lesson solution fukushima thyroid question hold september fukushima symposium revisit recapitulate evidence chernobyl order share multidisciplinary opinion view likely reason high rate thyroid detect thyroid ultrasound examination program fukushima prefecture high prevalence thyroid young individual cause concern among fukushima resident general public might due putative radiation exposure fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident twenty six expert japan abroad include participant affiliate international organization review result radiation epidemiology investigation chernobyl presented experience diagnosis follow radiation relate thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Biomarkers of thyroid function and autoimmunity for predicting high-risk groups of thyroid cancer: a nested case–control study A remarkable increase in the number of thyroid cancer cases has been reported in recent years; however, the markers to predict high-risk groups have not been fully established. We conducted a case–control study (257 cases and 257 controls) that was nested in the Cancer Screenee Cohort Study between August 2002 and December 2010; the mean follow-up time for this study was 3.1 ± 2.2 years. The levels of total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) were measured using samples with pre-diagnostic status. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between thyroid function/autoimmunity and thyroid cancer risk. When the markers were categorized by the tertile distributions of the control group, the highest tertile of FT4 (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.11 - 2.69) and the middle tertile of TSH (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.14 - 2.74) were associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer by multivariate analyses. In addition, an elevated risk for thyroid cancer was found in subjects with TPOAb levels above 30 IU/mL (OR = 8.47, 95% CI = 5.39 - 13.33 for 30–60 IU/mL and OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 2.59 - 7.76 for ≥60 IU/mL). Stratified analyses indicated that some of these associations differed by sex, BMI, smoking status, and the duration of follow-up. This study demonstrated that the levels of biomarkers of thyroid function/autoimmunity, particularly the presence of TPOAb, might be used as diagnostic markers for predicting thyroid cancer risk. Our findings suggest that careful monitoring of thyroid biomarkers may be helpful for identifying Korean populations at high-risk for thyroid cancer.","biomarkers of thyroid function and autoimmunity for predicting high-risk groups of thyroid cancer: a nested case–control study a remarkable increase in the number of thyroid cancer cases has been reported in recent years; however, the markers to predict high-risk groups have not been fully established. we conducted a case–control study (257 cases and 257 controls) that was nested in the cancer screenee cohort study between august 2002 and december 2010; the mean follow-up time for this study was 3.1 ± 2.2 years. the levels of total triiodothyronine (tt3), free thyroxine (ft4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), thyroglobulin (tg), anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (tpoab), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (tgab) were measured using samples with pre-diagnostic status. logistic regression models were used to examine the association between thyroid function/autoimmunity and thyroid cancer risk. when the markers were categorized by the tertile distributions of the control group, the highest tertile of ft4 (or = 1.73, 95% ci =",biomarkers thyroid function autoimmunity predict high risk group thyroid nested control remarkable increase number thyroid report recent year however marker predict high risk group fully establish conduct control control nest screenee cohort august december mean follow time year level total triiodothyronine tt free thyroxine ft thyroid stimulate hormone tsh thyroglobulin tg anti thyroperoxidase antibody tpoab anti thyroglobulin antibody tgab measure use sample pre diagnostic status logistic regression model use examine association thyroid function autoimmunity thyroid risk marker categorize tertile distribution control group high tertile ft ci,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Thyroid Dosimetry and Its Association With Radiation-Induced Hypothyroidism in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Conformal Radiotherapy: An Observational Study. Introduction Hypothyroidism is a common side effect in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). Conformal RT reduces the dose to normal tissues while delivering higher doses to tumors. However, hypothyroidism remains a significant toxicity in these patients. This study evaluates the incidence of hypothyroidism, thyroid dosimetric parameters, and their correlation with radiation-induced hypothyroidism in HNC patients treated with conformal RT at a regional cancer center in India. Methods Fifty patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treated with conformal RT, and who underwent pre- and post-treatment thyroid function tests were included in the study. All patients were euthyroid before treatment. The thyroid gland was contoured retrospectively in the approved RT plan. The volume of the contoured thyroid gland and the thyroid dosimetric parameters (Dmean, Dmax, Dmin, and V30-V60) were recorded. Pre- and post-treatment thyroid function test results were compared to look for the incidence of hypothyroidism, and dosimetric data were compared to establish a relation with the incidence of hypothyroidism. Results The median age was 53 years. Most patients had oral cavity primaries (60%), stage III/IVA disease (86%), and received definitive (64%) or adjuvant (36%) RT. Two-thirds underwent concurrent chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of four months, 24% developed hypothyroidism, with a median onset of 16 weeks post-treatment. Pharyngeal primary and concurrent chemotherapy were significant risk factors. Dosimetric analysis revealed Dmean > 57 Gy, V55 > 80%, and V60 > 37% as predictors of hypothyroidism. Conclusion Pharyngeal cancers, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and higher thyroid doses significantly increase the risk of hypothyroidism. Optimizing RT planning is essential to minimize thyroid toxicity, particularly in high-risk patients.","thyroid dosimetry and its association with radiation-induced hypothyroidism in head and neck cancer patients treated with conformal radiotherapy: an observational study. introduction hypothyroidism is a common side effect in head and neck cancer (hnc) patients treated with radiotherapy (rt). conformal rt reduces the dose to normal tissues while delivering higher doses to tumors. however, hypothyroidism remains a significant toxicity in these patients. this study evaluates the incidence of hypothyroidism, thyroid dosimetric parameters, and their correlation with radiation-induced hypothyroidism in hnc patients treated with conformal rt at a regional cancer center in india. methods fifty patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treated with conformal rt, and who underwent pre- and post-treatment thyroid function tests were included in the study. all patients were euthyroid before treatment. the thyroid gland was contoured retrospectively in the approved rt plan. the volume of the contoured thyroid gland and the",thyroid dosimetry association radiation induce hypothyroidism head neck treat conformal radiotherapy observational hypothyroidism common side effect head neck hnc treat radiotherapy rt conformal rt reduce dose normal tissue deliver high dos however hypothyroidism remain significant toxicity evaluate incidence hypothyroidism thyroid dosimetric parameter correlation radiation induce hypothyroidism hnc treat conformal rt regional center india method fifty histologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat conformal rt underwent pre post thyroid function test include euthyroid thyroid gland contour retrospectively approved rt plan volume contoured thyroid gland,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy. Robotic thyroidectomy has many advantages with comparable oncologic safety over conventional open surgery in low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer cases. However, there have been few reports on the outcomes of patients who have been treated with robotic thyroidectomy for more advanced thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy for more advanced thyroid cancer. The data of 80 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent robotic total thyroidectomy between January 2013 and December 2014 performed by a single surgeon at Chung-Ang University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 40 patients who had cancer larger than 2 cm or suspicious capsular invasion, or central lymph node (LN) metastasis in preoperative pathologic and radiologic examinations were categorized into the more advanced thyroid cancer group and the remaining patients into the early thyroid cancer group. We compared surgical safety and surgical completeness parameters between the two groups. The patients in more advanced thyroid cancer group had larger tumors, more extrathyroidal extension, and higher T stages. Surgical safety parameters, such as hypoparathyroidism, vocal cord palsy, and other complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Surgical completeness parameters, such as the mean number of retrieved LNs, median values of the stimulated thyroglobulin levels, and the proportion of patients with stimulated thyroglobulin levels less than 1 ng/mL, also did not differ significantly. The outcomes of the patients with more advanced thyroid cancer who were treated with robotic thyroidectomy were comparable to those of the early cancer group patients. Well-designed investigations that are conducted at multiple centers are needed to affirm the validity of expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy.","expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy. robotic thyroidectomy has many advantages with comparable oncologic safety over conventional open surgery in low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer cases. however, there have been few reports on the outcomes of patients who have been treated with robotic thyroidectomy for more advanced thyroid cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the validity of expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy for more advanced thyroid cancer. the data of 80 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent robotic total thyroidectomy between january 2013 and december 2014 performed by a single surgeon at chung-ang university hospital were retrospectively reviewed. among them, 40 patients who had cancer larger than 2 cm or suspicious capsular invasion, or central lymph node (ln) metastasis in preoperative pathologic and radiologic examinations were categorized into the more advanced thyroid cancer group and the remaining patients into the early thyroid cancer group. we compared surgical safety and",expand indication robotic thyroidectomy robotic thyroidectomy many advantage comparable oncologic safety conventional open surgery low risk differentiate thyroid however report outcome treat robotic thyroidectomy advanced thyroid investigate validity expand indication robotic thyroidectomy advanced thyroid data thyroid undergo robotic total thyroidectomy january december perform single surgeon chung ang university hospital retrospectively review among large cm suspicious capsular invasion central lymph node ln metastasis preoperative pathologic radiologic examination categorize advanced thyroid group remain early thyroid group compare surgical safety,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Thyroid Cancer Knowledge and Awareness in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study. Background Thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing worldwide over the last few decades. It is the most common endocrine cancer and is most common among females. The study contributes to filling the knowledge gap among Saudi people regarding thyroid cancer. Objectives This research aims to investigate the level of thyroid cancer knowledge and awareness in Saudi Arabia, identify potential knowledge gaps, and develop targeted strategies for enhancing public awareness and education. Methods A cross-sectional, voluntary online survey was conducted from 1st August 2023 to 1st October 2023 among residents living in Saudi Arabia over 18 years of age. The participants included were 2030 respondents. Data analysis was performed using RStudio (R version 4.3.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results Among the participants, the majority were female (60.4%). A total of 49.7% of the individuals reported having a moderate to high level of knowledge about thyroid cancer. While 63.9% knew the association of a lump in the neck to thyroid cancer, 82.6% affirmed to consult a doctor upon discovering a lump, 72.1% knew that regular monitoring of neck lumps is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of precancerous conditions, 38.7% were aware of females being prone to thyroid cancer, and 59.2% were aware of the link between lifestyle and increased risk. Higher awareness scores were positively associated with female gender, previously having thyroid function tests done, and previously undergoing a US scan of the thyroid. Conclusion In this study, Saudi individuals are reported to lack some aspects of knowledge and perception of thyroid cancer. This study emphasizes filling the existing knowledge gap in thyroid cancer awareness in the Saudi population.","thyroid cancer knowledge and awareness in saudi arabia: a cross-sectional study. background thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing worldwide over the last few decades. it is the most common endocrine cancer and is most common among females. the study contributes to filling the knowledge gap among saudi people regarding thyroid cancer. objectives this research aims to investigate the level of thyroid cancer knowledge and awareness in saudi arabia, identify potential knowledge gaps, and develop targeted strategies for enhancing public awareness and education. methods a cross-sectional, voluntary online survey was conducted from 1st august 2023 to 1st october 2023 among residents living in saudi arabia over 18 years of age. the participants included were 2030 respondents. data analysis was performed using rstudio (r version 4.3.0; r foundation for statistical computing, vienna, austria). results among the participants, the majority were female (60.4%). a total of 49.7% of the individuals reported having a",thyroid knowledge awareness saudi arabia cross sectional thyroid incidence increase worldwide last decade common endocrine common among female contribute fill knowledge gap among saudi people regard thyroid objectives research investigate level thyroid knowledge awareness saudi arabia identify potential knowledge gap develop targeted strategy enhance public awareness education method cross sectional voluntary online survey conduct st august st october among resident live saudi arabia year age participant include respondent data perform use rstudio r version r foundation statistical compute vienna austria result among participant majority female total individual report,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Preoperative serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is a predictive factor for lateral lymph node metastasis as well as extrathyroidal extension in Korean patients: a single-center experience. It has been known that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates the growth or development of thyroid malignancy and higher serum TSH has association with both thyroid cancer incidence and advanced tumor stage. However, the role of TSH in high-risk features of well-differentiated thyroid cancer was not fully evaluated especially in Asian population. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the association of preoperative serum TSH levels with the advance of differentiated thyroid cancer and its high-risk clinicopathological features in Korean patients. We evaluated 554 patients retrospectively who underwent thyroidectomy and diagnosed as differentiated thyroid cancer during a 3-year period at Pusan National University Hospital. The preoperative TSH levels were significantly higher in the patients with extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.002) and those with lateral lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007). As the increase of the serum TSH concentration, there were significant rising trends in the prevalence of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.009). In the patients with TSH ≥ 2.5 mIU/L, the prevalences of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.006) and lateral lymph node metastasis (P = 0.024) were also significantly higher. Using multiple logistic regression, preoperative TSH level was a predictive factor for the presence of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.008) and lateral lymph node metastasis (P = 0.025). Hashimoto’s thyroiditis itself was not associated with the status of extrathyroidal extension and lateral lymph node metastasis. In conclusion, preoperative TSH levels were associated with lateral lymph node matastasis, a novel finding, and extrathyroidal extension in well differentiated thyroid cancer and might be useful as a preoperative supplementary marker for determining the optimal extent of differentiated thyroid cancer surgery in Korean patients.","preoperative serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is a predictive factor for lateral lymph node metastasis as well as extrathyroidal extension in korean patients: a single-center experience. it has been known that thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) stimulates the growth or development of thyroid malignancy and higher serum tsh has association with both thyroid cancer incidence and advanced tumor stage. however, the role of tsh in high-risk features of well-differentiated thyroid cancer was not fully evaluated especially in asian population. the purpose of our study is to evaluate the association of preoperative serum tsh levels with the advance of differentiated thyroid cancer and its high-risk clinicopathological features in korean patients. we evaluated 554 patients retrospectively who underwent thyroidectomy and diagnosed as differentiated thyroid cancer during a 3-year period at pusan national university hospital. the preoperative tsh levels were significantly higher in the patients with extrathyroidal extension (p =",preoperative serum thyroid stimulate hormone level well differentiate thyroid carcinoma predictive factor lateral lymph node metastasis well extrathyroidal extension korean single center experience know thyroid stimulate hormone tsh stimulate growth development thyroid malignancy high serum tsh association thyroid incidence advanced stage however role tsh high risk feature well differentiate thyroid fully evaluate especially asian population evaluate association preoperative serum tsh level advance differentiated thyroid high risk clinicopathological feature korean evaluate retrospectively underwent thyroidectomy diagnose differentiated thyroid year period pusan national university hospital preoperative tsh level significantly high extrathyroidal extension p,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Metastatic rectal cancer to papillary thyroid carcinoma: a case report and review of literature Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare event. Rectal cancer to primary thyroid neoplasm metastasis is extremely rare. Herein, we reported a case of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma to a papillary thyroid carcinoma. The incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of metastatic colorectal cancer to a thyroid gland neoplasm were described, and the pertinent literature was reviewed. A 34-year-old female patient had curative treatment of initial rectal adenocarcinoma in 2012, and was found to have lung metastases by follow-up CT scan 3 years later. In 2018, she was found to have thyroid metastasis by imaging due to left neck pain and hoarseness. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) result suggested suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and bilateral cervical lymph nodes dissection. The histopathology of thyroidectomy specimen revealed a rectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the thyroid concomitant with the papillary carcinoma in metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient received levothyroxine supplementation therapy and palliative chemotherapy with irinotecan and anti-angiogenesis for the metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. After 1 year of thyroidectomy, no newly developed lesion evidence of recurrent PTC was observed. The patient remains still alive. The possibility of metastases should be considered in patients with a history of rectal cancer and with a thyroid lesion, particularly in those with ageing, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or long-term survival. The diagnosis should be histologically confirmed for the presence of both primary thyroid lesions and secondary thyroid neoplasms. Thyroidectomy may be a feasible treatment for symptomatic thyroid metastasis or thyroid cancer. we need to gain more available evidence from large or multi-center clinical data to help clinicians to diagnose rectal cancer to thyroid neoplasm metastases and evaluate treatment.","metastatic rectal cancer to papillary thyroid carcinoma: a case report and review of literature tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare event. rectal cancer to primary thyroid neoplasm metastasis is extremely rare. herein, we reported a case of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma to a papillary thyroid carcinoma. the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of metastatic colorectal cancer to a thyroid gland neoplasm were described, and the pertinent literature was reviewed. a 34-year-old female patient had curative treatment of initial rectal adenocarcinoma in 2012, and was found to have lung metastases by follow-up ct scan 3 years later. in 2018, she was found to have thyroid metastasis by imaging due to left neck pain and hoarseness. a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (fnab) result suggested suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc). the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and bilateral cervical lymph nodes dissection. the histopathology of thyroidectomy specimen revealed a rectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the thyroid concomitant with",metastatic rectal papillary thyroid carcinoma report review literature metastasis rare event rectal primary thyroid neoplasm metastasis extremely rare herein report metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma papillary thyroid carcinoma incidence clinicopathological characteristic metastatic colorectal thyroid gland neoplasm describe pertinent literature review year old female curative initial rectal adenocarcinoma find lung metastasis follow ct scan year later find thyroid metastasis image due left neck pain hoarseness fine needle aspiration biopsy fnab result suggest suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc undergo total thyroidectomy bilateral cervical lymph node dissection histopathology thyroidectomy specimen reveal rectal adenocarcinoma metastatic thyroid concomitant,e,Thyroid Cancer

"LncRNA XIST/miR-34a axis modulates the cell proliferation and tumor growth of thyroid cancer through MET-PI3K-AKT signaling Thyroid cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in endocrine system. Further understanding and revealing the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer are indispensable for the development of effective diagnosis and treatments. In the present study, we attempted to provide novel basis for targeted therapy for thyroid cancer from the aspect of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction. The expression and cellular function of XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) was determined. miRNAs which may be direct targets of XIST were screened for from online GEO database and miR-34a was selected. Next, the predicted binding between XIST and miR-34a, and the dynamic effect of XIST and miR-34a on downstream MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)-PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT (α-serine/threonine-protein kinase) signaling was evaluated. XIST was significantly up-regulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines; XIST knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation in vivo and the tumor growth in vitro. Based on online database and online tool prediction results, miR-34a was underexpressed in thyroid cancer and might be a direct target of XIST. Herein, we confirmed the negative interaction between XIST and miR-34a; moreover, XIST knockdown could reduce the protein levels of MET, a downstream target of miR-34a, and the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. In thyroid cancer tissues, MET mRNA and protein levels of MET were up-regulated; MET was positively correlated with XIST while negatively correlated with miR-34a, further confirming that XIST serves as a ceRNA for miR-34a through sponging miR-34a, competing with MET for miR-34a binding, and finally modulating thyroid cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. In the present study, we provided novel experimental basis for targeted therapy for thyroid cancer from the aspect of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction.","lncrna xist/mir-34a axis modulates the cell proliferation and tumor growth of thyroid cancer through met-pi3k-akt signaling thyroid cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in endocrine system. further understanding and revealing the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer are indispensable for the development of effective diagnosis and treatments. in the present study, we attempted to provide novel basis for targeted therapy for thyroid cancer from the aspect of lncrna-mirna-mrna interaction. the expression and cellular function of xist (x-inactive specific transcript) was determined. mirnas which may be direct targets of xist were screened for from online geo database and mir-34a was selected. next, the predicted binding between xist and mir-34a, and the dynamic effect of xist and mir-34a on downstream met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)-pi3k (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-akt (α-serine/threonine-protein kinase) signaling was evaluated. xist was significantly up-regulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines; xist knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation in vivo",lncrna xist mir axis modulate cell proliferation growth thyroid meet pi k akt signal thyroid one prevalent malignancy endocrine system far understanding reveal molecular mechanism underlie thyroid indispensable development effective diagnosis present attempt provide novel basis targeted therapy thyroid aspect lncrna mirna mrna interaction expression cellular function xist x inactive specific transcript determine mirnas may direct target xist screen online geo database mir select next predicted binding xist mir dynamic effect xist mir downstream meet hepatocyte growth factor receptor pi k phosphoinositide kinase akt serine threonine protein kinase signal evaluate xist significantly regulate thyroid tissue cell line xist knockdown suppress cell proliferation vivo,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Ultrasonography survey and thyroid cancer in the Fukushima Prefecture Thyroid cancer is one of the major health concerns after the accident in the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station (NPS). Currently, ultrasonography surveys are being performed for persons residing in the Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident with an age of up to 18 years. Here, the expected thyroid cancer prevalence in the Fukushima Prefecture is assessed based on an ultrasonography survey of Ukrainians, who were exposed at an age of up to 18 years to 131 I released during the Chernobyl NPS accident, and on differences in equip- ment and study protocol in the two surveys. Radiation risk of thyroid cancer incidence among survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and preliminary estimates of thyroid dose due to the Fukushima accident were used for the prediction of baseline and radiation- related thyroid cancer risks. We estimate a prevalence of thyroid cancer of 0.027 % (95 % CI 0.010 %; 0.050 %) for the first screening campaign in the Fukushima Prefecture. Compared with the incidence rate in Japan in 2007, the ultrasonography survey is predicted to increase baseline thyroid cancer incidence by a factor of 7.4 (95 % CI 0.95; 17.3). Under the condition of continued screening, thyroid cancer during the first fifty years after the accident is pre- dicted to be detected for about 2 % of the screened popu- lation. The prediction of radiation-related thyroid cancer in the most exposed fraction (a few ten thousand persons) of the screened population of the Fukushima Prefecture has a large uncertainty with the best estimates of the average risk of 0.1-0.3 %, depending on average dose.","ultrasonography survey and thyroid cancer in the fukushima prefecture thyroid cancer is one of the major health concerns after the accident in the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power station (nps). currently, ultrasonography surveys are being performed for persons residing in the fukushima prefecture at the time of the accident with an age of up to 18 years. here, the expected thyroid cancer prevalence in the fukushima prefecture is assessed based on an ultrasonography survey of ukrainians, who were exposed at an age of up to 18 years to 131 i released during the chernobyl nps accident, and on differences in equip- ment and study protocol in the two surveys. radiation risk of thyroid cancer incidence among survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and preliminary estimates of thyroid dose due to the fukushima accident were used for the prediction of baseline and radiation- related thyroid cancer risks. we estimate",ultrasonography survey thyroid fukushima prefecture thyroid one major health concern accident fukushima dai ichi nuclear power station nps currently ultrasonography survey perform person reside fukushima prefecture time accident age year expect thyroid prevalence fukushima prefecture assess base ultrasonography survey ukrainian expose age year release chernobyl nps accident difference equip ment protocol two survey radiation risk thyroid incidence among survivor atomic bombing hiroshima nagasaki preliminary estimate thyroid dose due fukushima accident use prediction baseline radiation relate thyroid risk estimate,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Adrenal metastasis as the initial diagnosis of synchronous papillary and follicular thyroid cancer Differentiated thyroid cancer uncommonly presents with distant metastases. Adrenal metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer presenting as the initial finding is even less common. A 71-year-old male was incidentally found on chest CT to have bilateral thyroid nodules, which were confirmed on ultrasound. Fine needle aspiration of the dominant right 3.3 cm nodule contained histologic features most consistent with Bethesda classification III, and repeat fine needle aspiration revealed pathology consistent with Bethesda classification II. Follow-up thyroid ultrasound showed 1% increase and 14% increase in nodule volume at one and two years, respectively, compared to baseline. Prior to the second annual thyroid ultrasound, the patient was incidentally found to have a 4.1 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right adrenal gland on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Biochemical evaluation was unremarkable with the exception of morning cortisol of 3.2 µg/dL after dexamethasone suppression. The patient then underwent laparoscopic right adrenal gland excision, which revealed metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy was then performed, with pathology showing a 4.8 cm well-differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma of the right lobe, a 0.5 cm noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features of the left lobe, and a 0.1 cm papillary microcarcinoma of the left lobe. Thyrotropin-stimulated whole body scan showed normal physiologic uptake of the remnant thyroid tissue without evidence of other iodine avid disease. The patient then received radioactive iodine. At follow-up 14 months after total thyroidectomy, he remains free of recurrent disease. Despite following the recommended protocol for evaluation and surveillance of thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer can be challenging to diagnose, and may not be diagnosed until distant metastases are identified.","adrenal metastasis as the initial diagnosis of synchronous papillary and follicular thyroid cancer differentiated thyroid cancer uncommonly presents with distant metastases. adrenal metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer presenting as the initial finding is even less common. a 71-year-old male was incidentally found on chest ct to have bilateral thyroid nodules, which were confirmed on ultrasound. fine needle aspiration of the dominant right 3.3 cm nodule contained histologic features most consistent with bethesda classification iii, and repeat fine needle aspiration revealed pathology consistent with bethesda classification ii. follow-up thyroid ultrasound showed 1% increase and 14% increase in nodule volume at one and two years, respectively, compared to baseline. prior to the second annual thyroid ultrasound, the patient was incidentally found to have a 4.1 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right adrenal gland on ct of the abdomen and pelvis. biochemical evaluation was unremarkable with the exception of morning cortisol of",adrenal metastasis initial diagnosis synchronous papillary follicular thyroid differentiate thyroid uncommonly present distant metastasis adrenal metastasis differentiate thyroid presenting initial finding even less common year old male incidentally find chest ct bilateral thyroid nodule confirm ultrasound fine needle aspiration dominant right cm nodule contain histologic feature consistent bethesda classification iii repeat fine needle aspiration reveal pathology consistent bethesda classification ii follow thyroid ultrasound show increase increase nodule volume one two year respectively compare baseline prior second annual thyroid ultrasound incidentally find cm heterogeneously enhance mass right adrenal gland ct abdomen pelvis biochemical evaluation unremarkable exception morning cortisol,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper regulates human thyroid cancer cell proliferation Long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (L-GILZ) has recently been implicated in cancer cell proliferation. Here, we investigated its role in human thyroid cancer cells. L-GILZ protein was highly expressed in well-differentiated cancer cells from thyroid cancer patients and differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines, but poorly expressed in anaplastic tumors. A fusion protein containing L-GILZ, when overexpressed in an L-GILZ-deficient 8505C cell line derived from undifferentiated human thyroid cancer tissue, inhibited cellular proliferation in vitro. In addition, when this protein was injected into nude mice, in which cells from line 8505C had been transplanted, xenograft growth was reduced. Since the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is frequently hyperactivated in thyroid cancer cells as a result of the BRAFV600E or Ras mutation, we sought to further investigate the role of L-GILZ in the MAPK pathway. To this end, we analyzed L-GILZ expression and function in cells treated with MAPK inhibitors. We used 8505C cells, which have the BRAFV600E mutation, or the CAL-62 cell line, which harbors a Ras mutation. The cells were treated with the BRAF-specific drug vemurafenib (PLX4032) or the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, respectively. Treatment with these agents inhibited MAPK activation, reduced cell proliferation, and upregulated L-GILZ expression. L-GILZ silencing reversed the antiproliferative activity of the MAPK inhibitors, consistent with an antiproliferative role. Treatment with MAPK inhibitors led to the phosphorylation of the cAMP/response element-binding protein (CREB), and active CREB bound to the L-GILZ promoter, contributing to its transcription. We suggest that the CREB signaling pathway, frequently deregulated in thyroid tumors, is involved in L-GILZ upregulation and that L-GILZ regulates thyroid cancer cell proliferation, which may have potential in cancer treatment.","long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper regulates human thyroid cancer cell proliferation long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (l-gilz) has recently been implicated in cancer cell proliferation. here, we investigated its role in human thyroid cancer cells. l-gilz protein was highly expressed in well-differentiated cancer cells from thyroid cancer patients and differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines, but poorly expressed in anaplastic tumors. a fusion protein containing l-gilz, when overexpressed in an l-gilz-deficient 8505c cell line derived from undifferentiated human thyroid cancer tissue, inhibited cellular proliferation in vitro. in addition, when this protein was injected into nude mice, in which cells from line 8505c had been transplanted, xenograft growth was reduced. since the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway is frequently hyperactivated in thyroid cancer cells as a result of the brafv600e or ras mutation, we sought to further investigate the role of l-gilz in the mapk pathway. to this end, we analyzed l-gilz expression and",long glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper regulate human thyroid cell proliferation long glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper l gilz recently implicate cell proliferation investigate role human thyroid cell l gilz protein highly express well differentiated cell thyroid differentiated thyroid cell line poorly express anaplastic fusion protein contain l gilz overexpressed l gilz deficient c cell line derive undifferentiated human thyroid tissue inhibit cellular proliferation vitro addition protein inject nude mouse cell line c transplant xenograft growth reduce since mitogen activate protein kinase mapk pathway frequently hyperactivated thyroid cell result brafv e ras mutation seek far investigate role l gilz mapk pathway end analyze l gilz expression,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Epidemiology of Thyroid Cancer: A Review of the National Cancer Database, 2000-2013. Objective ; ; To show the recent trends in thyroid cancer in the United States, elucidate the characteristics of stage IV thyroid cancer, and consider the effects of diagnostic testing on the rising incidence of thyroid cancer.; ; Design; ;  A retrospective population-based study conducted using the National Cancer Database from 2000-2013 (NCDB). Demographics of patients presenting with stage IV thyroid cancer were compared to patients presenting with all other stages using the chi-square testing. The incidence rates were examined with the trend graphs.; ; Results; ;  When compared to stages I-III, there was an increased incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer in: Medicare, lower level of education, lower income, advanced age, male sex, increased number of comorbidities, further distance from a treatment facility, and medullary/anaplastic histology. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 7.1 per 100,000 in 2000 to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2013. During this same time period, stage IV disease increased 1 per 100,000. The increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was almost entirely due to an increase in papillary cancer.; ; Conclusions; ;  The United States has continued to see a rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the last decade, largely due to the detection of papillary cancers. During this same time, the incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer increased as well. Because early diagnosis and treatment of an increasing number of potentially lethal cancers should lead to a decrease in metastatic disease, we suggest that the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States is due to overdiagnosis and that more aggressive disease is not being removed by early detection.","epidemiology of thyroid cancer: a review of the national cancer database, 2000-2013. objective ; ; to show the recent trends in thyroid cancer in the united states, elucidate the characteristics of stage iv thyroid cancer, and consider the effects of diagnostic testing on the rising incidence of thyroid cancer.; ; design; ; a retrospective population-based study conducted using the national cancer database from 2000-2013 (ncdb). demographics of patients presenting with stage iv thyroid cancer were compared to patients presenting with all other stages using the chi-square testing. the incidence rates were examined with the trend graphs.; ; results; ; when compared to stages i-iii, there was an increased incidence of stage iv thyroid cancer in: medicare, lower level of education, lower income, advanced age, male sex, increased number of comorbidities, further distance from a treatment facility, and medullary/anaplastic histology. the incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 7.1 per 100,000 in",epidemiology thyroid review national database show recent trend thyroid united state elucidate characteristic stage iv thyroid consider effect diagnostic test rise incidence thyroid design retrospective population base conduct use national database ncdb demographic present stage iv thyroid compare present stage use chi square test incidence rate examine trend graph result compare stage iii increased incidence stage iv thyroid medicare lower level education lower income advanced age male sex increase number comorbidities distance facility medullary anaplastic histology incidence thyroid increase per,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Thyroid Cancer Staging: Historical Evolution and Analysis From Macrocarcinoma to Microcarcinoma. The classification of thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment has evolved dramatically since the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) published the first staging system in 1968. A careful review of the eight published editions of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) staging by the UICC and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) was performed. Each edition was analyzed to clearly understand which development published and accepted by specialists treating thyroid cancer justified considering a new updated edition. This study presents a comprehensive review of the remarkable evolution of thyroid cancer staging, highlighting the various changes in several areas throughout the years and editions. There were surprising changes within the eight publications: the tumor size was progressively reduced from 4 cm in the first AJCC volume to less than 1 cm in the seventh and eighth UICC and AJCC editions, classifying these small, WDTCs known up to now as ""microcarcinomas."" Extrathyroidal extension was accepted after the third edition; this description certainly plays a key role in today's decisions to manage this tumor as a prognostic factor. The age specification of 45 years prevailed for seven consecutive publications until it was raised to 55 years in the eighth thyroid cancer staging system. Without a doubt, this iconic change allowed physicians around the world to give their 45-year-old thyroid cancer patients a more encouraging panorama of the disease with the new classification. Over the course of nearly 57 years, thyroid cancer staging has undergone remarkable changes, reaching a level of certainty that not only provides recommendations for safer treatments with less surgery and adjunctive measures but also improves survival rates and patient safety.","thyroid cancer staging: historical evolution and analysis from macrocarcinoma to microcarcinoma. the classification of thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment has evolved dramatically since the union for international cancer control (uicc) published the first staging system in 1968. a careful review of the eight published editions of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (wdtc) staging by the uicc and the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) was performed. each edition was analyzed to clearly understand which development published and accepted by specialists treating thyroid cancer justified considering a new updated edition. this study presents a comprehensive review of the remarkable evolution of thyroid cancer staging, highlighting the various changes in several areas throughout the years and editions. there were surprising changes within the eight publications: the tumor size was progressively reduced from 4 cm in the first ajcc volume to less than 1 cm in the seventh and eighth uicc and ajcc editions, classifying",thyroid stag historical evolution macrocarcinoma microcarcinoma classification thyroid diagnosis evolve dramatically since union international control uicc publish first staging system careful review eight publish edition well differentiate thyroid wdtc stag uicc american joint committee ajcc perform edition analyze clearly understand development publish accept specialist treat thyroid justify consider new updated edition present comprehensive review remarkable evolution thyroid stag highlight various change several area throughout year edition surprising change within eight publication size progressively reduce cm first ajcc volume less cm seventh eighth uicc ajcc edition classify,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Clinicopathological features of thyroid cancer in the elderly compared to younger counterparts: single-center experience. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increased in elderly patients. It tends to be larger and have more aggressive characteristics in these patients. Our aim was to compare features of thyroid carcinoma in geriatric and non-geriatric patients. In total, 933 patients with thyroid cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Thyroid functions, ultrasonography features of malignant nodules, cytological and histopathological findings and the rates of recurrence and persistence were compared in patients ≥65 and <65 years old. There were 153 malignant foci in 109 (11.7%) patients ≥65 and 1185 malignant foci in 824 (88.3%) patients <65 years old. Mean nodule diameter was significantly higher in geriatric patients (p = 0.008). Most of the ultrasonographical features of malignant nodules were similar in two groups. Hypoechoic halo was observed in 16.4 and 28.6% of malignant nodules in geriatric and non-geriatric group, respectively (p = 0.034). There was no significant difference in cytological diagnosis. Histopathologically, tumor diameter, rates of microcarcinomas and incidentality were similar. Of all cancer types, 88.8% in geriatric and 93.9% in non-geriatric group were papillary thyroid cancer (p = 0.028). Hurthle cell cancer constituted 3.9 and 1.1% of carcinomas in geriatric and non-geriatric patients, respectively (p = 0.015); 2.0 and 0.2% of tumors in geriatric and non-geriatric group were anaplastic, respectively (p = 0.012). Capsular and vascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension, persistence and recurrence rates were similar.;  Rates of anaplastic cancer and Hurthle cell cancer which is known to have worser prognosis among other differentiated thyroid cancers are increased in geriatric ages.

"Lung adenocarcinoma with thyroid metastasis: a case report The metastases of a primary lung cancer over the thyroid gland are extremely rare. We report on an unusual presentation of thyroid metastasis of lung cancer in order to improve the management of similar cases. Three years ago, a Moroccan male 59-year-old was admitted for dyspnea, dry cough, and chest pain. He had smoked about 30 cigarette packs a year. Clinical examination revealed a right thyroid nodule. Chest and neck computed tomography (CT) scan showed a proximal left tumor in contact with the pulmonary artery and revealed a suspected nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid with homolateral neck node. Transbronchial biopsy was performed and pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung and positive for thyroid transcription factor. Other explorations carried out, such as brain CT, bone scan and abdominal ultrasound were normal. After a repeated negative fine needle aspiration biopsy of the suspected nodule of the right lobe of the thyroid, we performed total thyroidectomy with neck dissection. An anatomopathologic exam revealed a tubulopapillary adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated. An Immunohistochemistry showed positive tumor cells with TTF1 and cytokeratin (CK) 7 but negative cells with thyroglobulin and CK20. Thus, the pulmonary tumor was classified stage IV. Chemotherapy based on the combination of cisplatin and etoposide was conducted along with supportive care. The tumor grew up with brain metastases after three cycles of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient died 2 months after despite brain radiotherapy.

"Anthropometric factors at age 20 years and risk of thyroid cancer Effect of anthropometric factors at adolescence and the change since young age on thyroid cancer risk is unclear. Here, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between anthropometric factors at the time of diagnosis and age 20 years and risk of thyroid cancer. A total of 173 patients with thyroid cancer (papillary carcinoma, n = 167 and follicular carcinoma, n = 6) and 865 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Anthropometric factors were assessed using a validated self-administered questionnaire and categorized into three groups. Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. Results showed a positive association between current weights, weight at age 20 years and height, and thyroid cancer risk. Adjusted ORs in the top tertiles were 2.46 (95% CI, 1.54-3.94; trend p \ 0.001) for current weight, 2.69 (95% CI, 1.71-4.25; trend p \ 0.001) for weight at age 20 years and 2.44 (95% CI, 1.52-3.93; trend p \ 0.001) for height compared with the lowest tertile.

"Vitamin C sensitizes BRAF V600E thyroid cancer to PLX4032 via inhibiting the feedback activation of MAPK/ERK signal by PLX4032 BRAFV600E mutation is the most common mutation in thyroid cancer. It strongly activates MAPK/ERK pathway and indicates an invasive subtype of thyroid cancer. PLX4032 is a selective oral inhibitor of the BRAFV600 kinase although with limited effect in treating this panel of thyroid cancer, due to the feedback activation of MAPK/ERK as well as PI3K/AKT pathways. It was investigated that Vitamin C plays a positive role in inhibiting these pathways in thyroid cancer. However, whether Vitamin C could enhance the antitumor effect of PLX4032 remains largely unclear. The antitumor efficacy of combination therapy with PLX4032 and Vitamin C on BRAFMT thyroid cancer cell was assessed by the MTT assay, EdU assay and colony formation, Chou-Talalay way was employed to analyze the synergistic effect. Flow cytometry were employed to assess cells’ apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in response to combination therapy. Xenograft models were used to test its in vivo antitumor activity. Western blot and IHC were applied to investigate the mechanism underlying synergistic effect. PLX4032 or Vitamin C monotherapy was mildly effective in treating BRAFMT thyroid cancer cell and xenografts model. The combination therapy significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in nude mice, and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest compared to either monotherapy.

"Update to the College of American Pathologists Reporting on Thyroid Carcinomas Background The reporting of thyroid carcinomas follows the recommendations of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) protocols and includes papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma and medullary carcinoma. Despite past and recent efforts, there are a number of controversial issues in the classification and diagnosis of thyroid carcinomas (TC) that, potentially impact on therapy and prognosis of patients with TC. Discussion The most updated version of the CAP thyroid cancer protocol incorporates recent changes in histologic classification as well as changes in the staging of thyroid cancers as per the updated American Joint Commission on Cancer staging manual. Among the more contentious issues in the pathology of thyroid carcinoma include the defining criteria for tumor invasiveness. While there are defined criteria for invasion, there is not universal agreement in what constitutes capsular invasion, angioinvasion and extrathyroidal invasion. Irrespective of the discrepant views on invasion, pathologists should report on the presence and extent (focal, widely) of capsular invasion, angioinvasion and extrathyroidal extension. These findings assist clinicians in their assessment of the recurrence risk and potential for metastatic disease. It is beyond the scope of this paper to detail the entire CAP protocol for thyroid carcinomas; rather, this paper addresses some of the more problematic issues confronting pathologists in their assessment and reporting of thyroid carcinomas. Conclusion The new CAP protocol for reporting of thyroid carcinomas is a step toward improving the clinical value of the histopathologic reporting of TC. Large meticulous clinico-pathologic and molecular studies with long term follow up are still needed in order to increase the impact of microscopic examination on the prognosis and management of TC.","update to the college of american pathologists reporting on thyroid carcinomas background the reporting of thyroid carcinomas follows the recommendations of the college of american pathologists (cap) protocols and includes papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma and medullary carcinoma. despite past and recent efforts, there are a number of controversial issues in the classification and diagnosis of thyroid carcinomas (tc) that, potentially impact on therapy and prognosis of patients with tc. discussion the most updated version of the cap thyroid cancer protocol incorporates recent changes in histologic classification as well as changes in the staging of thyroid cancers as per the updated american joint commission on cancer staging manual. among the more contentious issues in the pathology of thyroid carcinoma include the defining criteria for tumor invasiveness. while there are defined criteria for invasion, there is not universal agreement in what constitutes capsular invasion, angioinvasion and extrathyroidal invasion. irrespective of",update college american pathologist report thyroid carcinoma reporting thyroid carcinoma follow recommendation college american pathologist cap protocol include papillary carcinoma follicular carcinoma anaplastic carcinoma medullary carcinoma despite past recent effort number controversial issue classification diagnosis thyroid carcinoma tc potentially impact therapy prognosis tc discussion updated version cap thyroid protocol incorporate recent change histologic classification well change staging thyroid per updated american joint commission stag manual among contentious issue pathology thyroid carcinoma include defining criterion invasiveness define criterion invasion universal agreement constitute capsular invasion angioinvasion extrathyroidal invasion irrespective,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Comparison of Secondary and Primary Thyroid Cancers: Patient Characteristics and Postoperative Outcomes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Patients with Primary and Secondary Thyroid Cancers. Secondary thyroid cancer is believed to lead to a more aggressive clinical course than primary thyroid cancer. We aim to examine the difference between primary and secondary thyroid cancer in terms of patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes at the national level. A cross-sectional study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for 2003–2010 was merged with County Health Rankings Data. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were used to identify adult patients with thyroid cancer. A total of 21,581 discharge records were included. Overall, 16,625 (77.0 %) patients had primary cancer, while the rest (23.0 %) had secondary cancer. Younger ( 65 years) patients, males, and those of White or Hispanic background were more likely to have secondary cancers (p < 0.05 each). The prevalence of secondary cancer was higher in communities of low health risk (24.0 % vs. 21.1 %; p < 0.024). Secondary cancer was more likely to be managed by total thyroidectomy (odds ratio [OR] 2.40, 95 % CI 2.12–2.73) and to require additional radical neck dissection (OR 12.51, 95 % CI 10.98–14.25). Patients with secondary thyroid cancers were at higher risk of postoperative complications (p < 0.01 each).

However, compared with intermediate-volume surgeons, the complication risk was lower for high-volume (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.24–0.92; p = 0.026).

"Predictive factors that influence the course of medullary thyroid carcinoma Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is an infrequent form of thyroid cancer. We aimed to examine how gender and histological characteristics influence the rate of recurrence/persistent disease, distant metastases and survival and also to define specific characteristics of MTC microcarcinomas. The medical records of 85 patients with MTC were reviewed. The following characteristics were recorded: year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, tumor size, number of tumor foci, lymph node metastases, thyroid capsule and vascular invasion, infiltration of thyroid parenchyma and extrathyroid extension, and distant metastases. During follow-up (mean 78.8 months), persistent disease occurred in 40 patients, local recurrences in 5 and distant metastases in 32 patients. Local and distant disease appeared more frequently in patients with larger tumors (p < 0.005) and lymph node metastases (p < 0.01). In addition, patients with invasive tumors had local and distant disease more frequently. The percentage of males who had persistent disease and/or local recurrence was significantly higher than the percentage of males who did not (p < 0.05). Similar results were observed for distant disease (p < 0.01). Independent predictors of recurrence and persistent disease was the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis (risk ratio 11.66) and of distant metastases were the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis (risk ratio 17.42) and the presence of vascular invasion (risk ratio 2.41). Fifteen patients died due to MTC during follow-up (17.6 %). Patients who died were more frequently males, and had thyroid capsule invasion, extrathyroidal extension, vascular invasion and metastatic disease. Male sex, tumor size and invasive characteristics of the tumor are negative predictive factors for evolution of MTC.","predictive factors that influence the course of medullary thyroid carcinoma medullary thyroid cancer (mtc) is an infrequent form of thyroid cancer. we aimed to examine how gender and histological characteristics influence the rate of recurrence/persistent disease, distant metastases and survival and also to define specific characteristics of mtc microcarcinomas. the medical records of 85 patients with mtc were reviewed. the following characteristics were recorded: year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, tumor size, number of tumor foci, lymph node metastases, thyroid capsule and vascular invasion, infiltration of thyroid parenchyma and extrathyroid extension, and distant metastases. during follow-up (mean 78.8 months), persistent disease occurred in 40 patients, local recurrences in 5 and distant metastases in 32 patients. local and distant disease appeared more frequently in patients with larger tumors (p < 0.005) and lymph node metastases (p < 0.01). in addition, patients with invasive tumors had local and distant disease more",predictive factor influence course medullary thyroid carcinoma medullary thyroid mtc infrequent form thyroid examine gender histological characteristic influence rate recurrence persistent distant metastasis survival also define specific characteristic mtc microcarcinomas medical record mtc review follow characteristic record year diagnosis age diagnosis sex size number focus lymph node metastases thyroid capsule vascular invasion infiltration thyroid parenchyma extrathyroid extension distant metastasis follow mean month persistent occur local recurrence distant metastasis local distant appear frequently large p lymph node metastasis p addition invasive local distant,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Hsa_circ_0011385 accelerates the progression of thyroid cancer by targeting miR-361-3p. Thyroid cancer is an endocrine malignancy that is growing in incidence worldwide. Despite progress in diagnostics and treatment of thyroid cancer, prognosis remains poor. Emerging research has shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have crucial regulatory roles in cancers. However, the possible functions and mechanisms of hsa_circ_0011385 remain undetermined. Expression levels of hsa_circ_0011385 and miR-361-3p were evaluated by qRT-PCR assay. The interaction between hsa_circ_0011385 and miR-361-3p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Effects of hsa_circ_0011385 or miR-361-3p on cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion were confirmed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), carboxyfluoresceinsuccinimidyl ester (CFSE), flow cytometry, and Transwell assays in vitro. The effect of hsa_circ_0011385 on thyroid cancer progression was also determined by in vivo tumor formation assay. Target genes of miR-361-3p were predicted by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and the expression of apoptosis- and metastasis-related proteins were assessed by Western blot assay. Hsa_circ_0011385 upregulated in thyroid cancer; hsa_circ_0011385 knockdown inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, hsa_circ_0011385 could negatively regulate miR-361-3p by functioning as a sponge. Hsa_circ_0011385 promoted thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion and suppressed cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by targeting miR-361-3p in vitro.

"Src-mediated regulation of the PI3K pathway in advanced papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer Advanced stages of papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer continue to be plagued by a dismal prognosis, which is a result of limited effective therapies for these cancers. Due to the high proportion of thyroid cancers harboring mutations in the MAPK pathway, the MAPK pathway has become a focal point for therapeutic intervention in thyroid cancer. Unfortunately, unlike melanoma, a similar responsiveness to MAPK pathway inhibition has yet to be observed in thyroid cancer patients. To address this issue, we have focused on targeting the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, and we and others have demonstrated that targeting Src results in inhibition of growth, invasion, and migration both in vitro and in vivo, which can be enhanced through the combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of the combination therapy across a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines representing common oncogenic drivers (BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA). Interestingly, combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway overcomes intrinsic dasatinib resistance in cell lines where both the MAPK and PI3K pathways are inhibited, which we show is likely due to the regulation of the PI3K pathway by Src in these responsive cells. Interestingly, we have mapped downstream phosphorylation of rpS6 as a key biomarker of response, and cells that maintain rpS6 phosphorylation likely represent drug tolerant persisters. Altogether, the combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway holds great promise for improving the overall survival of advanced thyroid cancer patients with BRAF and RAS mutations, and activation of the PI3K pathway and rpS6 phosphorylation represent important biomarkers of response for patients treated with this therapy.","src-mediated regulation of the pi3k pathway in advanced papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer advanced stages of papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer continue to be plagued by a dismal prognosis, which is a result of limited effective therapies for these cancers. due to the high proportion of thyroid cancers harboring mutations in the mapk pathway, the mapk pathway has become a focal point for therapeutic intervention in thyroid cancer. unfortunately, unlike melanoma, a similar responsiveness to mapk pathway inhibition has yet to be observed in thyroid cancer patients. to address this issue, we have focused on targeting the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, src, and we and others have demonstrated that targeting src results in inhibition of growth, invasion, and migration both in vitro and in vivo, which can be enhanced through the combined inhibition of src and the mapk pathway. therefore, we examined the efficacy of the combination therapy across a panel",src mediate regulation pi k pathway advanced papillary anaplastic thyroid advance stage papillary anaplastic thyroid continue plague dismal prognosis result limited effective therapy due high proportion thyroid harbor mutation mapk pathway mapk pathway become focal point therapeutic intervention thyroid unfortunately unlike melanoma similar responsiveness mapk pathway inhibition yet observe thyroid address issue focus target non receptor tyrosine kinase src others demonstrate target src result inhibition growth invasion migration vitro vivo enhance combined inhibition src mapk pathway therefore examine efficacy combination therapy across panel,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Ensemble model for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response prediction and treatment sensitivity in TNBC based on DNA replication stress signatures. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has some effectiveness in TNBC, a portion of patients still do not benefit from them. The critical role of DNA replication stress (DRS) in cancer therapy has been recognized, but its study in TNBC NACT remains relatively limited. Affymetrix microarray data were obtained from the GEO database for both training and test sets. These data were processed using the ""affy"" R package. The Boruta algorithm and SVM-RFE method were employed for key gene selection, and an integrated model based on multiple algorithms was developed to establish a risk score. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment (TME) was analyzed, and the correlation between risk score and drug sensitivity was explored, incorporating several drug databases. Through the analysis of TNBC patients' responses to NACT, we found a close correlation between DRS and TNBC treatment responses and identified eight key genes. The developed ensemble model (ENS) demonstrated high AUC values of 0.922, 0.886, and 0.858 across the three independent datasets, respectively, indicating its strong ability to accurately predict the effectiveness of NACT. The study also revealed that patients with higher risk score are more prone to recurrence and metastasis, and have a rich TME composition. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis offers potentially effective personalized treatment options for high-risk TNBC. This study successfully constructed an ensemble model to predict TNBC patients' response to NACT. Additionally, it was discovered that the risk score held significant value in analyzing the correlation between TNBC patients' TME and drug sensitivity. These findings offer important new insights into personalized treatment strategies for TNBC.","ensemble model for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response prediction and treatment sensitivity in tnbc based on dna replication stress signatures. triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer. although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nact) has some effectiveness in tnbc, a portion of patients still do not benefit from them. the critical role of dna replication stress (drs) in cancer therapy has been recognized, but its study in tnbc nact remains relatively limited. affymetrix microarray data were obtained from the geo database for both training and test sets. these data were processed using the ""affy"" r package. the boruta algorithm and svm-rfe method were employed for key gene selection, and an integrated model based on multiple algorithms was developed to establish a risk score. additionally, the tumor microenvironment (tme) was analyzed, and the correlation between risk score and drug sensitivity was explored, incorporating several drug databases. through the analysis of tnbc",ensemble model neoadjuvant chemotherapy response prediction sensitivity tnbc base dna replication stress signatures triple negative breast tnbc highly aggressive subtype breast although neoadjuvant chemotherapy nact effectiveness tnbc portion still benefit critical role dna replication stress drs therapy recognize tnbc nact remain relatively limited affymetrix microarray data obtain geo database training test set data process use affy r package boruta algorithm svm rfe method employ key gene selection integrate model base multiple algorithm develop establish risk score additionally microenvironment tme analyze correlation risk score drug sensitivity explore incorporating several drug database tnbc,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Longchain serum fatty acids and risk of thyroid cancer: a population-based case-control study in Norway. Epidemiologic studies have shown an association between seafood consumption and risk of thyroid cancer. Fish meals increase the serum concentrations of the longchain fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (20∶5,n-3) (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22∶6,n-3) (DHA), for days. The hypothesis that serum concentrations of fatty acids may be associated with thyroid cancer risk therefore was tested in a population-based case-control study with 74 cases and 221 matched controls. Seventy-three cases with sera in the Norwegian serum bank (JANUS) were identified in the Norwegian Cancer Registry and matched with three controls, also in JANUS, on age, gender, place of residence, and time of blood sampling. Each case was matched with two controls. Serum concentrations of 11 longchain fatty acids were determined blindly by gas chromatography for all subjects. Controls were divided into three groups with increasing serum fatty acid concentrations, and odds ratios between cases and controls were estimated relative to the group with lowest serum level by univariate and multivariate analyses. The main finding was a significant inverse relation between the sum of arachidonic acid (20∶4,n-6) (AA) and DHA serum concentrations and thyroid cancer risk. The significance of this association was weakened when the analyses were restricted to the papillary type of thyroid carcinoma. It was of the same order of magnitude whether the period between blood sampling and diagnosis was greater than eight years, or eight or less years. High EPA/AA ratio, indicating consumption of fish fat, was not associated significantly with increased thyroid-cancer risk. These data indicate that the association between seafood ingestion and increased thyroid-cancer risk may not be caused by the marine fatty acids.","longchain serum fatty acids and risk of thyroid cancer: a population-based case-control study in norway. epidemiologic studies have shown an association between seafood consumption and risk of thyroid cancer. fish meals increase the serum concentrations of the longchain fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (20∶5,n-3) (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (22∶6,n-3) (dha), for days. the hypothesis that serum concentrations of fatty acids may be associated with thyroid cancer risk therefore was tested in a population-based case-control study with 74 cases and 221 matched controls. seventy-three cases with sera in the norwegian serum bank (janus) were identified in the norwegian cancer registry and matched with three controls, also in janus, on age, gender, place of residence, and time of blood sampling. each case was matched with two controls. serum concentrations of 11 longchain fatty acids were determined blindly by gas chromatography for all subjects. controls were divided into three groups with increasing serum fatty",longchain serum fatty acid risk thyroid population base control norway epidemiologic show association seafood consumption risk thyroid fish meal increase serum concentration longchain fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid n epa docosahexaenoic acid n dha day hypothesis serum concentration fatty acid may associate thyroid risk therefore test population base control match control seventy three serum norwegian serum bank janus identify norwegian registry match three control also janus age gender place residence time blood sample match two control serum concentration longchain fatty acid determine blindly gas chromatography subject control divide three group increase serum fatty,e,Thyroid Cancer
"Molecular detection of thyroglobulin mRNA transcripts in peripheral blood of patients with thyroid disease by RT-PCR The sensitive detection of circulating tumour cells in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer may precede the detection of relapse by other diagnostic studies – such as serum thyroglobulin – and thus may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications. We performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on blood samples from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease using two different RT-PCR sensitivities. Additionally, tissue specificity of TG mRNA-expression was determined using RNA extracts from 27 different human tissues. The lower limit of detection was 50–100 TG mRNA producing cells/ml blood using a ‘normal’ RT-PCR sensitivity and 10–20 cells/ml blood using a ‘high’ sensitivity. With the normal sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 9/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 63/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 21/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 9/50 controls. With the high sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 11/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 111/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 61/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 41/50 controls. Interestingly, using the normal RT-PCR sensitivity TG mRNA transcripts are specific for thyroid tissue and detectable in the peripheral blood of controls and patients with thyroid disease, which correlates with a diagnosis of metastasized thyroid cancer. However, with a high RT-PCR sensitivity, TG mRNA expression was found not to be specific for thyroid tissue and was not correlated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients. As a consequence, to date TG mRNA detected by RT-PCR in the peripheral blood cannot be recommended as a tumour marker superior to TG serum-level. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign","molecular detection of thyroglobulin mrna transcripts in peripheral blood of patients with thyroid disease by rt-pcr the sensitive detection of circulating tumour cells in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer may precede the detection of relapse by other diagnostic studies – such as serum thyroglobulin – and thus may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications. we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) on blood samples from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease using two different rt-pcr sensitivities. additionally, tissue specificity of tg mrna-expression was determined using rna extracts from 27 different human tissues. the lower limit of detection was 50–100 tg mrna producing cells/ml blood using a ‘normal’ rt-pcr sensitivity and 10–20 cells/ml blood using a ‘high’ sensitivity. with the normal sensitivity tg mrna was detected in 9/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 63/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 21/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 9/50",molecular detection thyroglobulin mrna transcript peripheral blood thyroid rt pcr sensitive detection circulate cell differentiated thyroid may precede detection relapse diagnostic serum thyroglobulin thus may important therapeutic prognostic implication perform reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr blood sample diagnose thyroid use two different rt pcr sensitivity additionally tissue specificity tg mrna expression determine use rna extract different human tissue low limit detection tg mrna produce cell ml blood use normal rt pcr sensitivity cell ml blood use high sensitivity normal sensitivity tg mrna detect thyroid metastasis history thyroid metastasis non malignant thyroid,e,Thyroid Cancer

"Brusatol attenuated proliferation and invasion induced by KRAS in differentiated thyroid cancer through inhibiting Nrf2. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) can be developed from differentiated thyroid cancer, and this dedifferentiated transformation leads to poor prognosis and high mortality. The role of Nrf2 in the dedifferentiation of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) induced by KRAS remains unclear.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND MATERIALS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">In this study, two DTC cell lines, BCPAP and WRO, were used to evaluate the function of Nrf2 in the dedifferentiation caused by wild-type KRAS (KRAS-WT) and G12V point mutation KRAS (KRAS-G12V).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The overexpression of KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V increased the proliferative and invasive ability of BCPAP and WRO cells. Aggressive morphology was observed in KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V overexpressed WRO cells. These results suggested that overexpression of KRAS-WT or KRAS-G12V may induce dedifferentiation in DTC cells. The expression of Nrf2 was increased by KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V in DTC cells. In addition, compared with normal thyroid tissues, the expression of Nrf2 protein was considerably higher in thyroid cancer tissues on immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and the increased expression of Nrf2 indicated a poor prognosis of thyroid cancer. These results indicated that Nrf2 is the KRAS downstream molecule in thyroid cancer. Functional studies showed that the Nrf2 inhibitor Brusatol counteracted the proliferative and invasive abilities induced by KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V in BCPAP and WRO cells. In addition, the xenograft assay further confirmed that Brusatol inhibits tumor growth induced by KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Collectively, this study suggests that Nrf2 could be a promising therapeutic target in KRAS-mediated dedifferentiation of thyroid cancer.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.
